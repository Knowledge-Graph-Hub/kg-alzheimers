It offers a less invasive and more accessible alternative to CSF and PET biomarkers (Ashton2020 chunk 1, Hansson2022 chunk 5).\n\nPlasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios, particularly when measured using immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS), are another accurate blood test for AD. However, their diagnostic performance is slightly lower than p-tau biomarkers due to smaller fold changes between A\u03b2-positive and A\u03b2-negative individuals (Hansson2022 chunk 2). Combining plasma biomarkers, such as p-tau with A\u03b242/A\u03b240 or neurofilament light (NfL), can further enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy (Hansson2022 chunk 5).\n\nReferences\n\n1.
