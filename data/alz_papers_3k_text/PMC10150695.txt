Palmitoylation of the Parkinson’s disease-associated protein synaptotagmin-11 links its turnover to α-synuclein homeostasis†

# Abstract
Synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11) is a vesicle trafficking protein that is linked genetically to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Likewise, the protein α-synuclein regulates vesicle trafficking, and its abnormal aggregation in neurons is the defining cytopathology of PD. Because of their functional similarities in the same disease context, we investigated whether the two proteins were connected. We found that Syt11 was palmitoylated in mouse and human brain tissue and in cultured cortical neurons, and that this modification to Syt11 disrupted α-synuclein homeostasis in neurons. Palmitoylation of two cysteines adjacent to the transmembrane domain, Cys 39 and Cys 40 , localized Syt11 to digitonin-insoluble portions of intracellular membranes and protected it from degradation by the endolysosomal system. In neurons, palmitoylation of Syt11 increased its abundance and enhanced the binding of α-synuclein to intracellular membranes. As a result, the abundance of physiologic tetrameric form of α-synuclein was decreased and that of its aggregation-prone monomeric form was increased. These effects were replicated by overexpression of wild-type Syt11 but not a palmitoylation-deficient mutant. These findings suggest that palmitoylation-mediated increases in Syt11 amounts may promote pathological α-synuclein aggregation in PD.

## Introduction
Genome-wide association studies have linked the synaptotagmin-11 ( SYT11 ) locus to Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk ( 1 – 3 ). Targeted sequencing of the SYT11 gene has validated this association ( 4 ). Syt11 is one of 17 members of the synaptotagmin family of transmembrane vesicle-associated proteins. Structurally, synaptotagmins consist of a short luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and two cytoplasmic C2 calcium-binding domains ( 5 ). However, the Syt11 C2 domains are unable to bind calcium due to their increased flexibility and altered orientations of specific residues ( 6 ). Whereas the functions of individual synaptotagmins vary, altogether this class of proteins is broadly involved in regulating vesicle dynamics, including trafficking and endo- and exocytosis at various intracellular locales ( 5 ).

Like most other synaptotagmins, Syt11 is expressed almost exclusively in brain tissue ( 7 ). Syt11 resides on vesicles distributed throughout the neuronal cell body, axons, and dendrites, and mediates both anterograde and retrograde vesicular trafficking ( 8 ). Functionally, forebrain-specific SYT11 -knockout mice show impaired synaptic plasticity and memory (conventional, whole-body knockouts are lethal within 24 hours of birth) ( 8 ). Others have found that Syt11 inhibits clathrin-mediated and bulk endocytosis ( 9 ) and suppresses spontaneous neurotransmission ( 10 ). In disease models, over-expression of Syt11 in the substantia nigra of mice results in defective release of dopamine and death of dopaminergic neurons, consistent with its possible role in PD ( 11 ).

The functions of Syt11 in vesicle trafficking and recycling are shared by a key player in PD, the neuronal protein α-synuclein (αS). αS is the principal component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the defining pathology of PD ( 12 ). Physiologically, αS binds dynamically to highly curved membranes, such as those in vesicles, by means of its amphipathic helix. In disease, certain pathologic forms of αS bind excessively, distorting vesicle shape and impairing their trafficking ( 13 – 16 ). Accordingly, Lewy bodies contain abundant misshapen membranous structures in addition to the classically described fibrillar proteinaceous aggregates of αS ( 17 ).

Given these commonalities between αS and Syt11 in the context of PD, we considered whether a functional link exists between them. We were particularly interested in the possible role of palmitoylation in mediating such a connection. Palmitoylation is the post-translational addition of a long-chain fatty acid, usually palmitate, to cysteines. This modification is known to regulate two other synaptotagmins, Syt1 and Syt7, by targeting the former to the synapse ( 18 ) and the latter to the lysosome ( 19 ). We have previously shown that although αS itself is not palmitoylated (as it lacks cysteines), inhibition of the depalmitoylase acyl-protein-thioesterase-1 (APT1) substantially mitigates αS pathologic inclusions and neurotoxicity ( 20 ), consistent with a role for palmitoylation in the regulation of αS homeostasis. Thus, here we explored whether Syt11 was palmitoylated and what connections the modification might have to αS in PD cytopathology.

## Results
To determine whether Syt11 is palmitoylated in the brain, we used the acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) method for the isolation of palmitoylated proteins ( 21 , 22 ). This technique uses hydroxylamine to selectively reverse thioester-linked palmitoyl moieties, enabling their replacement by a thiol-reactive pyridyldithiol-biotin (HPDP-biotin) that may then be used for affinity purification by neutravidin agarose. In brain homogenates from wild-type mice, a robust signal for Syt11 was detected in the ABE assay that was dependent on the presence of hydroxylamine, confirming specificity of the finding ( Fig. 1A ). PSD-95, a well-studied palmitoylated neuronal protein ( 23 ), produced a similar pattern, whereas actin, which is not palmitoylated, did not produce any signal. Using the same method, we showed robust Syt11 palmitoylation in rat primary cortical neurons in culture ( Fig. 1B ) and human cortical brain tissue ( Fig. 1C ).

We sought to identify the palmitoylation sites of Syt11. Two other synaptotagmins, Syt1 and Syt7, are known to be palmitoylated ( 18 , 24 ). In both, the palmitoylated sites are conserved cysteines near the transmembrane domain. Consistent with this, the palmitoylation site predictor algorithm CSS-Palm suggests that Cys 39 and Cys 40 in Syt11, adjacent to its transmembrane domain, may be palmitoylated. In contrast, a study demonstrating a site-specific ABE method in the mouse forebrain palmitoyl-proteome identified Cys 117 in the cytosolic domain of Syt11 (corresponding to human C118S) as the palmitoylated site ( 25 ). To differentiate between these possibilities, we transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with FLAG-tagged human wild-type Syt11 (Syt11-wt-FLAG) or cysteine-to-serine mutants corresponding to the above candidate sites, including a C39S/C40S double mutant. Whereas robust palmitoylation was detected for wild-type Syt11, mutating Cys 39 and Cys 40 to serines abolished the ABE signal ( Fig. 2 , A and B ). Mutating Cys 39 or Cys 40 individually resulted in reduction, but not complete loss, of the palmitoylation signal, consistent with the interpretation that Syt11 is palmitoylated at both cysteines ( Fig. 2 , A and B ). In contrast, C118S did not alter the degree of palmitoylation, indicating that this was not a modified site ( Fig. 2 , A and B ). Palmitoylation of endogenous SNAP-25 remained unchanged across the transfected conditions ( Fig. 2A ), demonstrating consistency of the ABE method.

To confirm the physiologic relevance of Cys 39 and Cys 40 in neurons, we transduced rat cortical neurons with lentivirus encoding either Syt11-wt-FLAG or the corresponding C39S+C40S double mutant (subsequently referred to as “CS”). ABE analysis demonstrated that, consistent with the HEK cell experiments, Syt11-CS-FLAG in neurons resulted in loss of palmitoylation ( Fig. 2C ). This was apparent despite the decreased total Syt11-CS-FLAG, as demonstrated by comparing the Syt11-CS-FLAG input signal in the long exposure with that of Syt11-wt-FLAG in the short exposure. A robust palmitoylation (ABE) signal was seen for Syt11-wt-FLAG in the short exposure, yet no signal was apparent for Syt11-CS-FLAG even in the long exposure, despite comparable inputs ( Fig. 2C ). Together, these results demonstrate physiologic palmitoylation of Syt11 at Cys 39 and Cys 40 across multiple neural systems.

The striking and consistent change in Syt11-CS-FLAG levels compared to those of Syt11-wt-FLAG ( Fig. 2C ) prompted us to further characterize this finding. First, we quantified the degree of decrease in Syt11-CS-FLAG protein abundance by Western blot (WB). We found that Syt11-CS-FLAG levels were approximately 20% those of Syt11-wt-FLAG in both rat neurons ( Fig. 3A ) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived, neurogenin-induced human neurons (iNs) from an αS gene ( SNCA ) triplication patient ( 26 ) ( Fig. 3B ). We then asked whether this change was due to decreased protein synthesis or increased degradation. Our experiments so far have employed a lentiviral construct containing the Syt11-FLAG open reading frame followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and a ZsGreen marker. We reasoned that defects in transcribing or translating the Syt11-CS-FLAG mRNA should also affect the ZsGreen marker. However, the intensity of ZsGreen fluorescence was unchanged between Syt11-wt-FLAG and Syt11-CS-FLAG transduced neurons ( Fig. 3 , C and D ), arguing against protein production as the responsible factor. Whereas protein translation downstream of an IRES does not always correlate exactly with that of the upstream gene of interest, in most instances translation becomes less efficient following the IRES. In our case, despite lower Syt11-CS-FLAG levels, ZsGreen was not significantly different, suggesting that less efficient translation was not a contributory factor in our experiments.

Although these data point towards increased degradation as the cause of the lower levels of palmitoylation-deficient Syt11, they do not demonstrate it definitively. To answer this question directly, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments to measure the half-life of wild-type and CS-mutant Syt11. In rat neurons, the half-life of transduced Syt11-wt-FLAG in the presence of cycloheximide was approximately 16 hours ( Fig. 3E ). However, abrogation of its palmitoylation (by expression of the CS mutant) resulted in marked reduction of Syt11’s half-life such that by 4 hours, more than 80% of the protein had been degraded ( Fig. 3E ). The half-life of endogenous GAPDH was unchanged in neurons transduced with either Syt11-wt-FLAG or Syt11-CS-FLAG ( Fig. 3F ), indicating that this was not due to non-specific effects on the protein degradation machinery.

Protein turnover may be regulated principally by either the ubiquitin-proteasome or endolysosomal systems, with cytosolic proteins generally degraded by the former and membrane-bound proteins by the latter ( 27 ). We explored which of these may be responsible for Syt11 degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome with either epoxomicin or MG132 did not affect the levels of Syt11-CS-FLAG ( Fig. 3G ). In contrast, inhibition of lysosomal function with bafilomycin A increased the amount of Syt11-CS-FLAG protein ( Fig. 3G ), indicating that the endolysosomal system is primarily responsible for Syt11 turnover. Accumulation of the lipidated form of the autophagasome marker LC3 (LC3-II) in the bafilomycin A-treated cells ( Fig. 3G ) demonstrated effective inhibition of the lysosome. Together, this series of experiments shows that palmitoylation of Syt11 is required for maintenance of its normal half-life, as regulated by the endolysosomal system.

The increased susceptibility of palmitoylation-deficient Syt11 to endolysosomal-mediated degradation led us to consider whether palmitoylation might alter the subcellular distribution of Syt11. First, we confirmed that lentivirally transduced Syt11-wt-FLAG, like endogenous Syt11, formed punctate structures throughout the neuronal soma, axons, and dendrites ( Fig. 4A ) as previously reported ( 8 ). We then compared the distribution of Syt11-wt-FLAG to that of Syt11-CS-FLAG ( Fig 4B ). Despite attempting to compensate for the lower levels of Syt11-CS-FLAG by transducing lentivirus at a higher multiplicity of infection (20 vs 5 for wt), overall expression of Syt11-CS-FLAG was still substantially reduced. Despite this, both Syt11-wt-FLAG and Syt11-CS-FLAG were found in broadly distributed punctate structures, which were less obvious in the case of Syt11-CS-FLAG due to lower amounts of protein but nevertheless present ( Fig. 4B ). This point is made clearer by comparing an artificially brightened image of Syt11-CS-FLAG to the untouched Syt11-wt-FLAG ( Fig. 4B ).

Because abrogating palmitoylation did not broadly affect Syt11 subcellular localization, we explored whether palmitoyation instead targets Syt11 to distinct membrane subdomains. These subdomains may be too close physically to be distinguished by microscopy but may be differentiated based on their biochemical characteristics. To address this question, we performed in situ digitonin extraction experiments ( 28 ) in HEK 293T cells expressing either Syt11-wt-FLAG, Syt11-CS-FLAG, or Syt11-C118S-FLAG. Because Syt11 has a transmembrane domain and is, by definition, membrane anchored, we used extractability by digitonin not as a means of distinguishing between cytosolic and membrane localization but as a method to empirically separate digitonin-soluble and -insoluble membrane subdomains. These subdomains insoluble in non-ionic detergents (such as digitonin) are cholesterol-rich, ordered areas of the membrane to which palmitoylated proteins are often targeted and from where they mediate trafficking and receptor signaling functions ( 29 ). Whereas Syt11-wt-FLAG was largely digitonin insoluble, a substantial portion of the Syt11-CS-FLAG could be extracted by digitonin ( Fig. 4C ). In contrast, the C118S mutant, which did not affect palmitoylation, had similar properties as wild-type Syt11 ( Fig. 4C ). We confirmed these findings in human iNs. As in the 293T cells, wild-type Syt11 showed increased resistance to digitonin extraction compared to the palmitoylation-deficient mutant ( Fig. 4D ), despite lower overall levels. Thus, palmitoylation targets Syt11 to digitonin-insoluble portions of membranes.

In addition to modulating properties of the modified proteins themselves, palmitoylation can also affect the local interacting membrane environment. In particular, the fatty acid chains of palmitoylated proteins can induce curvature of the lipid bilayer, likely through a biophysical interaction of the fatty acid chains with the phospholipids ( 30 , 31 ). αS binds to certain highly curved membranes through its amphipathic helix and can thereby affect vesicle trafficking ( 13 , 15 , 32 , 33 ). Because Syt11 is also localized to intracellular vesicles ( 8 ), we investigated whether the presence or absence of palmitoylated Syt11 could affect the dynamic binding of αS to these curved membranes. To address this disease-relevant question, we turned once again to human iPSC-derived iNs from patients with familial PD that harbor a triplication in the gene encoding αS ( SNCA ) ( 26 ). Expression of palmitoylation-competent Syt11 (wt), but not palmitoylation-deficient Syt11 (CS mutant), resulted in higher membrane association of αS (decreased cytosol to membrane ratio; Fig. 5A ). This was also the case in the corrected version of these patient-derived neurons ( Fig. 5B ), in which the start codons for two SNCA alleles are disrupted by CRISPR/Cas ( 26 , 34 ).

Changes in the membrane association of αS have been associated with disruptions in the normal ratio of physiologic α-helical αS tetramers to aggregation-prone monomers ( 35 , 36 ). Thus, we asked whether the palmitoylation state of Syt11 can also affect the equilibrium between the αS tetramer (of 60 kDa; hereafter, αS60) and its monomer (of 14 kDa; hereafter, αS14). Using a well-established in vivo cross-linking method ( 37 – 39 ), we observed that in αS triplication patient-derived neurons, expression of Syt11-wt-FLAG, but not palmitoylation-deficient Syt11-CS-FLAG, decreased the tetramer to monomer (αS60:40) ratio by approximately 30% ( Fig. 5C ). In contrast, the relative dimerization of endogenous DJ-1, a control protein not known to be affected by Syt11 or αS, was unchanged in the same cells, arguing against a non-specific effect of Syt11 ( Fig. 5C ). The αS60:40 ratio was similarly reduced by Syt11-wt-FLAG but not Syt11-CS-FLAG in the genetically corrected version of these neurons ( Fig. 5D ). Given these effects of Syt11 on αS state, we then considered whether Syt11 binds directly to αS. However, in rat neurons transduced with Syt11-wt-FLAG, we did not detect any specific interaction with αS ( fig. S1 ). Thus, Syt11 alters the membrane binding properties and homeostasis of αS in a palmitoylation-dependent manner without direct binding to αS, possibly through changes in local membrane environment.

αS tetramers and related multimers in neurons have consistently been found to be physiologic, distinct from any pathologic oligomers of the aggregation-prone monomer ( 37 , 39 – 41 ). In contrast, phosphorylation of αS at Ser 129 (pSer 129 αS) is an important but unsettled aspect of αS biology, with some studies suggesting a role for it in normal physiology ( 42 – 44 ) and others implicating a role for it in PD pathogenesis ( 45 , 46 ). Having shown an effect of Syt11 expression on the αS tetramer:monomer balance ( Fig. 5 ), we investigated whether pSer 129 αS was also affected. In αS-triplication iNs, in corrected iNs, and in rat neurons, we did not see any effect of Syt11-wt-FLAG or Syt11-CS-FLAG expression by lentiviral transduction on pSer 129 αS levels ( Fig. 6 , A to C ). However, neurogenerative diseases like PD can develop from subtle contributing factors that act over decades of life that may not be apparent from the mere weeks-long time scale of cells in culture. Without a longer-term model, we instead wondered whether detectable changes in pSer 129 could be elicited with greater over-expression of Syt11 over an even shorter period. For this, we turned to transient transfection in HEK cells, in which transiently transfected Syt11 reaches levels approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than that in the iNs ( Fig. 6D ). In HEK cells expressing high levels of αS-wt by transient transfection, the co-transfection of Syt11-wt-FLAG substantially increased the abundance of pSer 129 αS, whereas expression of Syt11-CS-FLAG did not achieve the same effect ( Fig. 6E ). Expression of C118S-mutant Syt11, which does not affect its palmitoylation, increased the abundance of pSer 129 αS in a manner that was indistinguishable from that by expression of wild-type Syt11 ( Fig. 6E ). Phosphorylation of the familial PD αS mutant αS-E46K ( 47 ), which exhibits higher levels of pSer 129 αS compared to αS-wt ( 48 ), was influenced by Syt11 in a similar way as αS-wt, with Syt11-wt-FLAG, but not palmitoylation-deficient Syt11 or the C118S-mutant, increasing pSer 129 of αS-E46K ( Fig. 6E ). Expression of Syt1 or the structurally closely related Syt4 ( 6 ) did not alter pSer 129 levels, unlike Syt11 wt ( Fig. 6F ), suggesting that this effect was specific to wt Syt11. Given that there was no effect on pSer 129 αS levels in the same cells in which (palmitoylatable) Syt11 affected the tetramer:monomer equilibrium of αS, the findings indicate that αS assembly state and its phosphorylation status may be dissociated in the context of Syt11. However, it remains to be determined whether these states are as well dissociated in the decades-long context of human PD.

## Discussion
The disruption of vesicle trafficking is a fundamental feature of PD biology ( 14 ). αS binds to vesicle membranes and accounts for many of these effects in the disease ( 14 , 15 , 49 ). Recent work on Syt11 has demonstrated that it is also involved in vesicle trafficking ( 8 ). Our study demonstrates a link between Syt11 and αS, mediated by palmitoylation of Syt11. Combined with our previous work connecting palmitoylation with cellular pathologies caused by αS, our new findings add further evidence to the overall hypothesis that palmitoylation is a regulator of multiple pathways involved in vesicle dynamics relevant to PD.

Our data provide evidence that Syt11 undergoes palmitoylation and pinpoint where in the protein this occurs. One striking result from our experiments is the rapid degradation of the Syt11-CS palmitoylation deficient mutant. Although palmitoylation is better known for targeting proteins to the membrane or membrane subdomains, there is some precedent for palmitoylation also being required for protein stability ( 29 ). However, in the case of the other two known palmitoylated synaptotagmins, Syt1 and Syt7, palmitoylation targets them to specific subcellular compartments and does not play a role in protein turnover ( 18 , 19 ). This difference is consistent with the growing recognition that despite structural similarities, the synaptotagmins have highly specialized and distinct functions subject to different modes of regulation ( 5 ).

We found that the palmitoylation-deficient mutant of Syt11 is degraded rapidly through the endolysosomal system, without any changes in protein levels following proteasomal inhibition. Our result contrasts with a prior work which reported that Syt11 is ubiquitinated by parkin and degraded by the proteasome ( 50 ). This may be explained by the use of over-expressed parkin in HEK cells in the prior work, which may allow for parkin-dependent ubiquitination of non-physiologic substrates ( 51 ). Mechanisms of protein turnover may also be different in HEK cells compared to neurons. Indeed, we found that Syt11-CS-FLAG levels were unaffected in HEK cells ( Fig. 6E ), in contrast to what we saw in rat and human neurons ( Fig. 3 , A and B ). Further, the notion that Syt11 may not be a normal substrate of parkin is supported by the absence of Syt11 in several subsequent unbiased proteomic datasets of parkin substrates in neurons ( 52 – 54 ).

We demonstrate here that Syt11 affects αS homeostasis in a manner that requires intact palmitoylation sites (Cys 39 and Cys 40 ). These sites are shown to be required for both Syt11 protein stability and its localization to digitonin-resistant areas of the membrane. Because mutation of Cys 39 and Cys 40 cannot differentiate between these two functions, our data did not specifically attribute the effect of Syt11 on αS to one or the other. In future experiments, it may be possible to identify an alternate mutant that can dissociate the two functions to define more precisely which is most relevant to αS. For example, a constitutively prenylated mutant of Syt11 containing C39S+C40S may still localize to the digitonin-resistant areas of the membrane but could still be subject to more rapid endolysosomal degradation due to its lack of palmitoylation. Although this might be of mechanistic interest, from a functional perspective it does not substantially change the broader finding that palmitoylation of Syt11 affects αS homeostasis, with its associated disease implications.

As part of our analysis, we examined both αS tetramers and αS phosphorylation at Ser 129 . Decreased abundance of αS tetramers (αS60), resulting in an increase in aggregation-prone monomers (αS14), is consistently associated with human synucleinopathies like PD, DLB and Gaucher’s-PD ( 37 , 39 – 41 ). In contrast, the role of pSer 129 αS is less clear, despite the abundance of this species in Lewy bodies ( 55 ). Thus, although an abnormally decreased αS60:40 ratio is often associated with increased pSer 129 ( 56 – 58 ), this is not always the case. The more recently described familial PD αS-G51D mutant is one such example, in which a decreased αS60:14 ratio is not associated with increased pSer 129 αS ( 36 ). Our results show that in addition to mutants of αS itself, proteins which regulate its function like Syt11 can selectively alter αS homeostasis without increasing pSer 129 αS.

In our prior work we had demonstrated that inhibition of the depalmitoylase APT1 increases palmitoylation of MAP6, a microtubule binding protein which also traffics with vesicles, and this reduces αS phosphorylation, inclusions, and cytotoxicity ( 20 ). This would imply a salutary effect of MAP6 palmitoylation. In contrast, palmitoylated Syt11 decreases physiologic αS tetramers and is therefore predicted to be associated with disease. These results suggest, unsurprisingly, that the fundamental process of palmitoylation has diverse effects depending on the specific proteins and pathways involved. Considering our results with Syt11 and MAP6, it is likely that palmitoylation intersects in additional complex ways with αS in PD biology. From a therapeutic development perspective, targeting the palmitoylation cycle of Syt11 may be of benefit in PD. In particular, inhibition or genetic knockdown of the specific zDHHC palmitoyltransferase responsible for Syt11 may reduce its palmitoylation levels and restore αS homeostasis. Such an approach is underway in our laboratory.

The variants in Syt11 associated with PD are in non-coding regions of the gene ( 4 ). It is unclear whether these would lead to increased or decreased expression of Syt11. Based on our findings, we speculate that even slightly increased levels of Syt11, over the many years required for development of neurodegenerative disease, would eventually lead to αS dyshomeostasis and PD. This would be consistent with previous reports showing that over-expression of Syt11 inhibits vesicle pool recycling, inhibits dopamine release, and causes neurotoxicity in mouse substantia nigra ( 11 ). To test the disease relevance of these data, future work examining levels of Syt11 in autopsy brain samples from PD patients would be informative.

Together, our experiments demonstrate that palmitoylation of Syt11 is an important biological event that regulates both Syt11 protein turnover and αS homeostasis in the context of PD. This work begins to bring mechanistic clarity to the role of Syt11 in disease and provides further evidence that palmitoylation influences multiple pathways in the biology of αS.

For transient transfection, plasmids for pCMV6-Syt11-FLAG (RC205445), Syt1 (RC208938), Syt 4 (RC206304), and their corresponding empty vector pCMV6-entry (PS100001) were purchased from Origene. The C39S, C40S, C39S+C40S, and C118S mutants were custom made by Origene in the pCMV6-entry vector. For lentivirus, the Syt11-wt-3xFLAG and Syt11-CS-3xFLAG ORFs were synthesized (Azenta) and cloned into the SpeI-NotI sites in the pLVX-EF1α-IRES-ZsGreen lentiviral vector (Takara #631982) followed by generation of lentiviral particles by Alstem (Richmond, CA). Lentiviral particles were introduced to rat neurons between days 5 to 7 in vitro (DIV5-7) and to iNs between DIV6-8.

HEK cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM GlutaMAX supplement (Gibco).

Primary neurons were cultured from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories). All animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Rats were euthanized with CO 2 followed by thoracotomy. Embryonic cortices were isolated and dissociated with trypsin/EDTA and trituration. Cells were plated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 10 units/mL of penicillin, and 10 μg/mL of streptomycin on poly D-lysine coated plates. Subsequently, half the medium was removed and replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium as above but without antibiotics twice weekly for maintenance of cultures. Rat neurons were used for experiments between DIV16-19.

The SNCA triplication iPSC line was obtained from The European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC) (#EDi0001-A) along with the isogenic CRISPr-corrected control line (#EDi0001-A4), in which the start codon of two copies of the SNCA gene were disrupted by CRISPR/Cas ( 26 , 34 ). Each line was transduced with TetO-Ngn2-Puro as described ( 60 ) to establish “NR” ( n eurogenin-2 + r tTA) iPSCs. Neurogenin-2 mediated differentiation was done as described ( 60 , 61 ). All iNs were grown on poly-L-ornithine/laminin pre-coated plates (Biocoat). iNs were used for experiments at between DIV21-24.

Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue homogenates from frozen brain samples or cells in culture were analyzed by the acyl- biotin exchange assay as described with minor modifications ( 62 ). Briefly, mouse whole brain tissue was homogenized using an IKA Microstar 7.5 stirrer set at 750 rpm and a Wheaton/DWK 5 mL tissue grinder (DWK #357974) in 3 mL buffer containing (in mM): 50 Tris, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease inhibitors. For cells, samples were re-suspended in the same lysis buffer and further extracted with 7 passes through a 27G syringe. For human brain cortical tissue, a small sample of previously frozen tissue was homogenized as above but in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 2% SDS. All extracts were treated with 10 mM NEM for 20 min at 37°C. Proteins were precipitated with acetone and labeled with 0.4 mM pyridyldithiol-biotin (HPDP-biotin) in buffer containing either 0.56 M hydroxylamine or 0.56 M Tris, at pH 7.4, for 1 hour at room temperature. Proteins were run through a Zeba desalting column (Pierce) followed by acetone precipitation. Biotinylated proteins were purified using neutravidin beads (Pierce), eluted with 1% BME, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting.

Cells were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt, Thermo). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Equal amounts of protein were loaded and run on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Transfers onto either nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes were performed using template P0 on an iBlot 2 (Invitrogen). For experiments involving detection of αS, membranes were then fixed for 15 min in 4% PFA (in PBS). Blocking was done using 5% milk in PBS. Membranes were incubated in primary antibody in 5% milk in PBST overnight at 4°C. For all experiments involving measurement of pSer 129 αS, nitrocellulose membranes were used, and blocking was instead done in Odyssey Blocking Buffer, TBS (LI-COR), and primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer, TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween. Imaging of membranes was performed using appropriate secondary antibodies followed by scanning on an Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR). For ABE experiments, immunoblotting was done on PVDF membranes and visualized by ECL using SuperSignal West Pico Plus (Thermo) on an iBright CL1500 Western Blot Imaging System (Invitrogen).

Rat neurons were transduced with either vector control or Syt11-wt-FLAG lentivirus. Between DIV16-19, cells were lysed in 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors and added to 40 μL of washed M2 FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). Proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Affinity gel was washed 3 times in lysis buffer followed by elution in 1x LDS and SDS-PAGE.

Rat neurons were imaged using the Incucyte Zoom (Essen) and ZsGreen fluorescence was quantified using the following processing definition: Adaptive background subtraction, threshold (GCU) 0.1; edge split on, sensitivity 25; cleanup: hole fill 10 μm 2 ; filters: area (μm 2 ) min 105, max 500, mean intensity min 28.

Rat neurons were seeded at 1.5x10 5 cells per well of a 2-chamber cell imaging cover glass (Eppendorf #0030742010) and transduced with lentivirus if indicated between DIV5-7. Images were acquired on a Leica DMi8 Widefield microscope. Images shown were obtained at 100x. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 5% goat serum. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in the same solution, washed with PBS, followed by conjugation to the appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies. After a second round of washes, cover glasses were mounted to slides with Fluormount G and imaged.

Cells were treated with 20 μg/mL of CHX (Sigma). At the appropriate time points, cells were lysed and stored for subsequent Western blotting.

Neurons were treated overnight with either DMSO control, Bafilomycin A (50 nM), epoxomicin (1 μM), or MG132 (5 μM), followed by cell lysis and subsequent Western blotting.

Digitonin-based in situ sequential extraction was performed precisely as described previously ( 28 ).

Neurons in 24-well plates were washed in HBSS containing calcium and magnesium to prevent cell detachment. Next, cells were crosslinked in 1 mM final concentration of disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at 37°C without shaking. The reaction was halted by the addition of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 (final concentration) and incubating at 15 min on the bench at room temperature. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer and prepared for immunoblotting as described above.
