# Title
Multiple Cerebral Hemorrhages in a Patient Receiving Lecanemab and
Treated with t-PA for Stroke

## TO THE EDITOR:
The results of the phase 3 trial of the
anti–amyloid- β drug lecanemab for the treatment
of early Alzheimer’s disease, reported in the Journal by van
Dyck et al., 1 have suggested a
beneficial effect on cognition scores and daily activities over a period of 18
months. An extension phase of the trial is ongoing. We report a case of numerous
acute intracerebral hemorrhages that developed after treatment with intravenous
tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for acute ischemic stroke syndrome in a patient
who received three doses of intravenous lecanemab.

A 65-year-old patient who was homozygous for the APOE ε4 allele and was in the early stages of cognitive decline presented to an
emergency department 30 minutes after the acute onset of aphasia and left gaze
preference due to an ischemic stroke. The patient had participated in the randomized
phase of the trial of lecanemab, during which the treatment assignment is not known,
followed by participation in the open-label phase, in which three intravenous
lecanemab infusions were received (one infusion every 2 weeks), with the latest
infusion administered 4 days before the stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
the head that had been performed 81 days before the stroke showed mild small-vessel
disease, with no microhemorrhages, edema, or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities
(Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this
letter at NEJM.org ), and computed tomography (CT) performed
just before t-PA administration showed hypodensities in the left
temporal–parietal regions and a distal left middle cerebral artery branch
occlusion but no hemorrhage. (Further clinical information is provided in the
Supplementary Appendix.)

The patient had no contraindications to thrombolysis (blood pressure, 163/84
mm Hg; platelet count, 256×10 3 per microliter; international
normalized ratio, 1.0; fibrinogen level, 304 milligrams per deciliter) and was
within the conventional time window for thrombolysis. After intravenous
administration of an 8-mg t-PA bolus and 50 minutes into the t-PA infusion (when
65.7 mg of the total dose of 76 mg had been administered), hypertension suddenly
developed (blood pressure, 250/111 mm Hg) and the t-PA infusion was stopped. A CT
scan showed extensive, multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages. There was no
systemic bleeding. Cryoprecipitate and tranexamic acid were administered. The
patient had global aphasia and severe agitation; frequent, nonconvulsive seizures
seen on electroencephalography were treated successfully with multiple antiseizure
medications. Three days after presentation for the stroke, the patient underwent
endotracheal intubation. MRI of the head showed acute right thalamocapsular
infarction and innumerable multifocal cortical and subcortical hemorrhages with
surrounding edema ( Fig. 1A and 1B ). The patient was treated with comfort measures at the
request of the family and subsequently died. The autopsy showed extensive multifocal
intraparenchymal hemorrhages, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, “high”
Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes, 2 and diffuse histiocytic vasculitis with
necrotizing vasculopathy involving amyloid deposition within (but not outside) the
blood-vessel walls ( Fig. 1C , 1D , and 1E ).

The extensive number and variation in sizes of the cerebral hemorrhages in
this patient would be unusual as a complication of t-PA solely related to
cerebrovascular amyloid. The findings raise the possibility of cerebral hemorrhages
and necrotizing vasculopathy associated with t-PA infusion in a patient with
cerebrovascular amyloid who had received lecanemab.
