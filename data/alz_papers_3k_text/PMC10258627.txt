# Title
Microglia-mediated T cell Infiltration Drives Neurodegeneration in Tauopathy

# Abstract
Extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition as neuritic plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are two of the characteristic hallmarks in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 1 , 2 . The regional progression of brain atrophy in AD highly correlates with tau accumulation but not amyloid deposition 3 – 5 and the mechanisms of tau-mediated neurodegeneration remain elusive. Innate immune responses represent a common pathway for the initiation and progression of some neurodegenerative diseases. To date, little is known about the extent or role of the adaptive immune response and their interaction with innate immune response in the presence of Aβ or tau pathology 6 . We systematically compared the immunological milieus in the brain of mice with amyloid deposition or tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. We found that mice with tauopathy but not amyloid, developed a unique innate and adaptive immune response and that depletion of microglia or T-cells blocked tau-mediated neurodegeneration. T cells, especially cytotoxic T cells, were markedly increased in areas with tau pathology in mice with tauopathy and in the AD brain. T cell numbers correlated with the extent of neuronal loss, and dynamically transformed their cellular characteristics from activated to exhausted states along with unique TCR clonal expansion. Inhibition of IFN-γ and PD-1signaling both significantly ameliorated brain atrophy. Our results thus reveal a tauopathy and neurodegeneration-related immune hub involving activated microglia and T cell responses, which could serve as therapeutic targets for preventing neurodegeneration in AD and primary tauopathies.

## Increased T cells with tau pathology
To further investigate the apparent expansion of T cells observed in our scRNA-seq data, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the parenchyma from TE4, A/PE4 and 5xE4 mice using antibodies to cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), pan markers for T cells and microglia, respectively. We found that T cells were significantly elevated in 9.5 month TE4 mice, but not in 9.5 month E4 controls or in 6-month-old TE4 mice ( Fig. 2a , 2b and Extended Data Video. 1). Increased T cells were also found in TE3 mice ( Extended Data Fig. 3c ) and Tau mice expressing mouse ApoE, suggesting a linkage between T cells and tau-mediated neurodegeneration rather than requiring a specific ApoE isoform. Interestingly, T cells were not obviously increased in amyloid-depositing A/PE4 and 5xE4 mice at 9.5 months of age or even at 19 months of age compared with TE4 mice ( Fig. 2a – c ). Of note, CD3 staining was primarily present in hippocampus and piriform/entorhinal cortex, which are regions with hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation and neuronal loss, indicating a possible detrimental role for T cells in tau-dependent neurodegeneration ( Extended Data Fig. 3d ). In accordance with the increase of infiltrated T cells, microglia were also significantly elevated in 9.5 month TE4 mice in regions with brain atrophy ( Fig. 2a , 2d ). The number of T cells showed a positive correlation with the number of microglia ( Fig. 2e ) and negatively correlated with the granule cell layer thickness in DG ( Fig. 2f ). To assess whether the T cells were localized in the brain parenchyma as opposed to within the vasculature, we co-stained brain vessels by retro-orbital Lectin-dye injection and CD3, and noted that CD3 + cells were not present in the lumen of blood vessels ( Fig. 2c ). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also revealed that T cells were in the parenchyma adjacent to other cells in the brain ( Extended Data Fig. 3e ). To determine whether a similar tau pathology-associated increase of T cells is present in the parenchyma in human AD, we performed immunohistochemical analyses in brain samples of AD patients (superior frontal gyrus) with low (I-II) and high (VI) Braak stages ( Fig. 2g and Extended Data Table 2 ). In line with the amount of phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) pathology, CD3 + T cells were strongly elevated in the superior frontal gyrus from Braak stage VI vs. the Braak stage I or II cases ( Fig. 2g , 2h , 2i ). By contrast, in these samples, overall Aβ deposition was similar in brain tissues with both low and high Braak stages ( Fig. 2g , 2j ). Together, these data demonstrate increased parenchymal T cells are present in brain regions with tauopathy but not in the presence of only amyloid deposition in both humans and mice.

## T cells shift states with tau pathology
To depict the cellular and molecular signatures of the T cells in the presence of Aβ or tau pathology, we assessed T cell populations from single cell immune RNA-seq data from CD45 high cells in the parenchyma and CD45 Total cells in the meninges in E4, A/PE4 and TE4 mice. T cells were categorized into 15 subgroups across all samples based on expression of featured genes ( Fig. 3a , Extended Data Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 3 ). Cell population analysis revealed population differences between parenchyma and meninges. Naïve CD8 + T cells (subgroup 11), Folr4 + CD4 + T cells (subgroup 4) and Regulatory T cells (subgroup 13) were highly enriched in meninges, but effector CD8 + T cells (subgroups 3, 8, 10) were preferentially enriched in brain parenchyma ( Fig. 3b ). These results suggest that brain-border and brain-resident T cells are functionally different in accordance with their immune niche. Interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is critical to adaptive immunity 33 . T cells clonally expand, when they recognize cognate antigen 34 . We next performed single cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) on T cells, which showed unique T cell clonal enrichment in the parenchyma with tauopathy and neurodegeneration ( Extended Data Fig. 4b – d ). We evaluated TCR repertoires among CD4 + T cell subsets and observed an increased clonality in CD4 + T cells in TE4 mice that was concentrated within the activated CD4 + T cells (Nkg7 + Ccl5 + and Cxcr6 + Ccr8 + CD4 + T cells) ( Fig. 3c – e ). Similar to what we found in CD4 + T cells, paired TCRα/TCRβ repertoire analysis revealed TCR clonal expansion in CD8 + T cells in TE4 mice ( Fig. 3f ). Unsupervised clustering identified 10 robust cell types in CD8 + T cells ( Fig. 3g , Extended Data Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 3 ). Activated CD8 + T cells (CD11c + Klre1 + and Isg15 + CD8 + T cells) were more abundant in TE4 mice, while the fraction of Tox + Pdcd1 + CD8 + exhausted T cells were slightly decreased, suggesting a potential role of activated CD8 + T cells in mediating neuronal loss in tauopathy ( Fig. 3h ). Pseudotime analysis of CD8 + T cells found a range of T cell states indicative of a dynamic shift from activated to exhausted states ( Fig. 3i ). We also observed an increased clonality in activated and exhausted CD8 + T cells in TE4 mice ( Fig. 3j ). Together, these data illustrate T cells in the brain parenchyma dynamically shift from activated to exhausted states with unique TCR clonal expansion in both CD4 + and CD8 + populations in the brain in a mouse model of tauopathy.

## Interaction of microglia and T cells
We next explored the unique but complex immune hubs in the parenchyma of tauopathy brains, which lead to T cell homing and activation. Notably, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL10, chemokines previously reported to be associated with T cell chemotaxis and brain infiltration were increased in the brain lysates of TE4 mice compared to E4 and TEKO (P301S Tau:ApoE KO) mice 25 , 35 ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Microglia are the first responders to neuroinflammation or damage and they rapidly adapt their phenotypes and functions in response to the dynamic brain milieu 36 . Typical functions of microglia such as phagocytosis and cytokine production have been well characterized in models of neurodegeneration including AD 37 , 38 ; however, whether they exert their effects via their interactions with T cells is largely unknown. We sub-grouped microglia (cell type 0, Fig. 1f ) from the CD45 Total population of E4, A/PE4 and TE4 mice and obtained 3 subgroups with distinguishing markers associated with homeostatic microglia (HOM), disease associated microglia (DAM) and interferon-activated microglia (IFN) ( Fig. 4a , 4b ). Notably, DAM and IFN subgroups were strongly elevated in TE4 mice, while the HOM subgroup decreased ( Fig. 4c and Extended Data Table 3 ). We found genes related to antigen presentation, complement response and cytokines, metabolism and oxidative stress, together with lysosomal enzymes were upregulated in TE4 mice to a greater extent compared to A/PE4 mice, which were greater than the control mice ( Fig. 4d ). Classically, MHCI and MHCII enable antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells, respectively. MHCI is expressed by all nucleated cells, while MHCII is only expressed by antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as DCs, macrophages, B cells and microglia 39 . By co-staining with the perivascular macrophage marker, MRC1 mannose receptor C (CD206), in addition to MHCII, Iba1 and GFAP, we found MHCII was primarily present in Iba1 + microglia in the brain parenchyma in neurodegeneration regions ( Extended Data Fig. 6a ). Indeed, in line with the increase in parenchymal T cells, we found that MHCII + microglia were significantly elevated in brain regions with tau pathology in TE4 mice ( Extended Data Fig. 6b , 6c ). DAM and its sub-types have been well characterized in amyloid models 40 . Here, in TE4 mice, we found Integrin, α X (CD11c) positive microglia, a representative marker for myeloid cell 2 (Trem2)-dependent type 2 DAM, physically co-localized with CD8 + T cells (Extended data video. 2). Interestingly, CD11c was also strongly increased in TE4 hippocampus as compared to the A/PE4 and E4 control mice ( Extended Data Fig. 6d , 6e ). These results highlight a tight correlation with MHCII + microglia, CD11c + microglia, T cells and neurodegeneration. Sparse MHCII + microglia and CD11c + microglia were also found co-localized with parenchymal plaques in A/PE4 mice ( Extended Data Fig. 6b , 6d ). ApoE deletion rescued brain atrophy in TEKO mice and MHCII + and CD11c + microglia as well as T cells were significantly decreased ( Extended Data Fig. 6 b – g ). The higher inflammatory reactivity associated with Tau-mediated neurodegeneration and ApoE were also confirmed by assessment of inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue from TE4 and TEKO mice ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Together, these data demonstrate that parenchymal microglia, in the presence of tauopathy, shift their transcriptomic and phenotypical states from homeostatic to disease-associated, CD11c + , MHCII + and IFN-activated states, with accompanying increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines.

IFN-γ, a cytokine upregulated in TE4 mice, is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by NK, NKT, and T cells that can prime microglia for inflammatory responses to injury as well as promote cytotoxic CD8 + T cell function 6 . Previous studies identified IFN-γ related transcriptomic signatures in tauopathy and neurodegenerative disease models, although the cell-type expression and functional result of IFN-γ on pathology was not described 41 . Ligand-receptor analysis revealed active interactions within T cells and microglia ( Extended Data Fig. 7a ). IFN-γ receptor was already known to be expressed in both neurons and microglia in the brain 42 . Importantly, we found that in the brain of TE4 mice, IFN-γ transcripts were enriched in T cells, especially CD8 + T cells ( Extended Data Fig. 7b ). Given that IFN-γ can augment antigen presenting and inflammatory functions of myeloid cells, we further investigated the role of IFN-γ in the immune response in tauopathy. To determine whether microglia can present antigen to T cells in vitro , we co-cultured microglia acutely isolated from adult mouse brain with OT-1 T cells, with soluble ovalbumin (OVA) as antigen, and found that microglia were capable of weakly stimulating OT-1 T cell proliferation compared to DCs ( Extended Data Fig. 8c – f ). However, upon IFN-γ stimulation, OT-1 T cell proliferation was strongly enhanced in the presence of microglia with OVA ( Extended Data Fig. 8e , 8f ), nearly to the level observed with DCs, suggesting that microglia in vitro can serve as antigen presenting cells and that IFN-γ can augment this response. Together, these data suggest the possibility that there are active interactions between microglia and infiltrated T cells.

To determine the role of endogenous IFN-γ in the P301S mice in vivo and to study the interplay between activated microglia and T cells, we blocked IFN-γ signaling by peripheral administration i.p. every five days with a neutralizing antibody in TE3 mice from 7.5 to 9.5 months of age, right before T cell infiltration into the brain parenchyma. Anti-IFN-γ (αIFN-γ) treatment resulted in attenuated brain atrophy as compared to the IgG treatment control ( Extended Data Fig. 8a – d ). CD11c + microglia were also significantly reduced in αIFN-γ treated mice ( Extended Data Fig. 8e , 8f ) and there was a significant reduction in p-Tau staining in αIFN-γ treated mice ( Extended Data Fig. 8g , 8h ). Taken together, these results suggest that IFN-γ secreted by CD8 + T cells in the brain can augment tau pathology and neurodegeneration, at least in part through promoting inflammatory microglial signaling and antigen presentation functions.

To further delineate the interrelationship between the activated microglia and infiltrated T cells, we administered PLX3397, a selective CSF1R/c-kit/FLT3 inhibitor, in TE4 and E4 control mice from 8.5 months to 9.5 months of age ( Extended Data Fig. 9i ). PLX3397 treatment resulted in strong microglial depletion ( Fig. 4e – k ). PLX3397 treatment also decreased hippocampal atrophy and ameliorated the increased of ventricular volume in TE4 mice ( Fig. 4l – o ). Notably, CD3 + and CD8 + T cells as well as tau pathology were reduced upon microglia depletion ( Fig. 4p – r ), suggesting a pivotal role of microglia, especially activated microglia, in setting of the tauopathy-specific immune hubs by recruiting and activation T cells into the brain parenchyma and a detrimental role of this re-structured immune hub in facilitating disease progression.

## T cell depletion prevent degeneration
To directly investigate whether infiltration of T cells leads to neurodegeneration, we depleted T cells by peripheral administration of neutralizing antibodies in TE4 mice as well as their age-matched non-tau transgenic littermates from 6 months to 9.5 months of age, a critical time window when neurodegeneration develops ( Extended Data Fig. 8j ). A single dose acute i.p. treatment with anti-CD4 (αCD4) and anti-CD8 (αCD8) antibodies (αT) led to strong CD4 and CD8 T cells depletion in brain parenchyma, meninges and peripheral blood, confirming the antibody depletion efficiency ( Extended data Fig. 9a , 9b ). Strikingly, in TE4 mice with αT treatment (i.p. every 5 days) from 6 months to 9.5 months, brain atrophy was strongly ameliorated compared to IgG treated control ( Fig. 5a – d ). T cells were almost completely eliminated in the brain parenchyma in TE4 mice after 3.5 months of αT antibody treatment ( Fig. 5e , 5g , 5h , 5i ). Interestingly, T cell depletion also reduced overall microglial staining ( Fig. 5e , 5f , 5g , 5j ), suggesting that T cells in the brain of TE4 mice can augment microgliosis. To assess the activation status of microglia with and without T cells depletion, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the parenchyma from TE4-IgG and TE4-αT treated mice using antibodies to P2ry12, MHCII and CD11c ( Fig. 5f , 5g ). We found significant elevation of P2ry12 + microglia and reduced MHCII + and CD11c + microglia ( Fig. 5k – m ) in the αT antibody treated mice, suggesting microglia shift from activated towards a more homeostatic state after T cell depletion. Single cell RNA seq analysis of microglia from αT antibody vs. the IgG control treated mice also revealed strong suppression of different aspects of the disease related microglia signature and an increase in the homeostatic signature ( Extended Data Fig. 9c – e ). To assess tau pathology following T cell depletion, we analyzed p-Tau immunoreactivity in hippocampus and found a significant reduction in p-Tau in αT treated mice ( Fig. 5n ). Four major p-Tau staining patterns, designated as type1–4, strongly correlated with the level of brain atrophy, with type 1 associated with most preserved brain tissue and type 4 associated with the greatest atrophy. Depletion of T cells resulted in a significant shift of p-Tau staining pattern toward the earliest disease stage ( Fig. 5o , 5p ). We also assessed plasma protein levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neuroaxonal damage and neurodegeneration 43 . NfL concentration in T cell depleted mice was significantly reduced ( Fig. 5q ). Behavioral performance assessment revealed that after depletion of T cells, nest-building behavior in 9.5 month TE4 mice was significantly improved ( Extended Data Fig. 10f ). We also assessed an additional cohort of TE4 mice that we treated with αT antibody vs. the IgG control from 6 months to 8.5 months of age. Assessment of behavioral performance revealed that depletion of T cells resulted in significant improvement in 2 additional behaviors. Y maze alternation, assessing short-term memory and exploratory behavior, as well as freezing in response to auditory cue, assessing amygdala-dependent memory, were significantly improved ( Fig. 5r – u and Extended Data Fig. 9g – i ). Freezing behavior in response to a contextual cue showed a trend toward increased hippocampal dependent memory after depletion of T cells ( Fig. 5t ). Both groups showed similar baseline levels of general exploratory behavior, and locomotor activity levels ( Extended Data Fig. 9g – h ) and response to tone/shock pairing in the fear conditioning test ( Fig. 5s ). Together, these data demonstrate that T cell depletion decreases functional decline.

Immune checkpoints are regulatory pathways for maintaining systemic immune homeostasis and tolerance 44 . Programmed death (PD)-1 is a checkpoint protein expressed on T cells, which processes inhibitory signals to control the magnitude of adaptive immune responses and tolerance 45 . Previous reports indicate that PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade decreases cognitive impairment in mouse models with AD pathology 46 , 47 . PD1 blockade can lead to increased activation of exhausted CD8 T cells or enhanced immunosuppression through increased activation of PD1 + CD4 + Tregs 48 . To investigate whether a treatment that targets PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could be effective in tauopathy, we administered anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) treatment in TE4 mice from 8 months to 9.5 months of age, a time window that brain atrophy dramatically develops. We found that with one-week acute αPD-1 treatment increased percentage of Foxp3 + CD4 + Tregs and Pd1 + Foxp3 + CD4 + Tregs, with no obvious changes on Klrg1 + effector CD8 + T cells and total Pd1 + Tox + CD8 + T cells in the brain ( Extended Data Fig. 10 a – e ). These results suggest that PD1-antibody treatment at this age would increase immunosuppressive CD4 Tregs. Consistent with this hypothesis, chronic treatment beginning at 8 months significantly decreased tau-mediated neurodegeneration and p-Tau staining ( Extended data Fig. 10f – i ), further supporting a role for T cells in tau-mediated neurodegeneration.

In this study, we present a comprehensive cellular and molecular immune response map in the brain and meninges during the development of amyloid or tau pathology and neurodegeneration via scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq. We find that an immunological hub involving activated microglia and T cells are overrepresented in brain regions with tauopathy and neuronal loss. Though evidence regarding the pathological changes and the role of microglia in AD are emerging, here, we expand on the immune microenvironment in tauopathy by assessing a previously less examined adaptive immunological response and their interaction with cells in the brain. T cells dynamically shift from activated to exhausted states with unique TCR clonal expansion. More importantly, we present direct evidence that breaking the neurodegeneration-featured immune hub between activated microglia and infiltrated T cells effectively prevents neurodegeneration and improve cognitive decline in AD and primary tauopathies.

As an innate primary response, microglia appear to play an anti- (restrict plaque and inflammation expansion) or pro-inflammatory (response to neuronal damage and aggregated tau and lead to severe neurodegeneration) role in AD 12 . Here, we found CD11c and MHCII expression strongly increased in microglia specifically in brain atrophy regions. MHCI and MHCII complex genes were highly upregulated in activated microglia in tauopathy. More importantly, as adaptive responses, we discovered that within both a mouse model of tauopathy and AD patient brain samples, T cells are not only present in the brain parenchyma but their enrichment also highly correlates with the severity of brain atrophy. Removal and modulation of T cells rescued the brain atrophy and highlighted that T cells play an important role in neurodegeneration.

The complex nature of the central nervous system (CNS) necessitates its own specialized immunological adaptations to detect and respond to environmental changes. Here we found significantly different proportions of T cells in the meninges and brain parenchyma. These results highlight that CNS-border and CNS-resident T cells are functionally different in accordance with their immune niche. The local tauopathy-related microenvironment in the brain parenchyma is likely to be instructive for recruiting and guiding the transformation of T cells. The interaction of T cells with APCs has been well established in peripheral systems 49 and CNS-borders 32 . Here, our findings raise a fundamental question regarding the interaction of T cells with APCs in the brain parenchyma. We find that T cells actively interact with the disease related microglia subgroups. Depletion of microglia largely abolishes T cell infiltration and depletion of T cells also remarkably hinders microglia activation, strengthening immunological communication between the innate and adaptive family of immune cells. In combined scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq analyses, we uncover unique T cells clonal expansion enriched in the parenchyma with tauopathy and neurodegeneration. To understand which specific antigens are resulting in T-cell infiltration, such as variously modified forms of tau, other proteins or myelin debris released by damaged neurons are presented to adaptive immune cells within tauopathy and AD remains an intriguing question. Sequencing TCRs at the single cell level combined with high-throughput peptide screening would enable elucidation of the specific antigens, which might in turn yield pathological stage-specific therapeutic strategies. Microglia express many pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind and internalize foreign misfolded proteins 50 . We found T cell infiltration did not increase in the Tau mice lacking ApoE. Therefore, a previously overlooked immunomodulatory function of ApoE may serve as an important mechanism linking both innate and adaptive immunity. Mapping the disease state-specific interlink between microglia and T cells, including their signaling communications, presented antigens, and pathophysiological responses will be a key nexus to set up unique therapeutic interventions to prevent or reverse brain atrophy in tauopathies.

## Online-only Methods
Human ApoE knock-in mice, ApoE3 and ApoE4 (E3 and E4, respectively), were generated by replacing the mouse genomic sequence from the translation initiation codon in exon2 to the termination codon in exon4 with its human counterparts flanked by loxP sites 51 . P301S tau transgenic mice (Jax, #008169) on C57BL/6 background were crossed to human ApoE KI or ApoE KO mice (Jax, #002052) to generate P301S/E3 (TE3), P301S/E4 (TE4), and P301S/EKO (TEKO) mice respectively. All tau transgenic mice involved in the final analysis were obtained from the same generation. A/PE4 and 5XFADE4 mice have been described 8 , 51 . Littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. All animal procedures and experiments were performed under guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC) at Washington University School of Medicine.

All participants gave prospective pre-mortem written consent for their brain to be banked and used for research with information to potentially be published under procedures approved by the human institutional review board at Banner Sun Health Research Institute. Patient demographics can be found in Extended Data Table 2 .

The left hemi-brain of each mouse was fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C and then placed in 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Serial free-floating coronal sections were cut from the rostral crossing of the corpus callosum to the caudal end of the hippocampus at 50 μm on a Leica SM2010 microtome. Brain sections (spaced 300 μm apart) from bregma −1.3 mm to −3.1 mm were mounted for volumetric analysis. All mounted sections were stained with 0.1% Sudan black (Sigma, 199664–25G) in 70% ethanol at RT for 20 min, washed in 70% ethanol for 50s, 3 times. The sections were washed in Milli-Q water 3 times and covered with Floromount-G (Southern Biotech, 0100–01). Slides were scanned using Hamamatsu’s NanoZoomer microscope at 20x magnification. Hippocampus, Ent/Piri cortex and ventricles were traced using NDP viewer. The volume was calculated using formula: volume= (sum of area) x 0.3 mm.

Two sections from each mouse (300 μm apart), corresponding approximately to bregma coordinates −1.4 mm, −1.7 mm were used for p-tau staining. Brain sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer for 3 min followed by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in TBS for 10 min at RT. After 3 times washing in TBS, sections were blocked by 3% milk in TBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (TBSX) for 1h at RT followed by incubation with AT8-biotinylated antibody (Thermo Scientific, MN1020B) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, after 3 times washing in TBS, the slices were developed by VECTASTAIN Elite ABC-HRP kit (Vector laboratories, PK-6100) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were covered by cytoseal60 (Thermo Scientific, 8310–4) and scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer microscope at 20x magnification. Images were analyzed by ImageJ.

For immunofluorescent staining, two sections (bregma −2.0 mm and −2.3 mm) from each mouse were used. The sections were washed in TBS 3 times, permeabilized with 0.25% TBSX for 10 min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA in 0.25% TBSX for 1h at RT. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed in TBS and incubated with corresponding fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at RT. The slices were washed and mounted in prolong gold antifade mounting media (Invitrogen, P36930). Primary antibodies were as follows: CD3 (Novus, NB600–1441, 1:200), CD8 (Invitrogen, MA1–145, 1:100), Iba1(Wako, 019–19741, 1:2000; Abcam, ab5076, 1:500), AT8 (Invitrogen, MN1020B, 1:500), Aβ (Homemade, HJ3.4B, 1:1000), P2ry12 (Gift from Butovsky lab, 1:2000), NeuN (Abcam, ab177487, 1:1000), MBP (Abcam, ab7349, 1:500), MHCII (Biolgend, 107650, 1:200), X34 (Sigma, 1954–25MG, 10mM in DMSO stock, 1:5000), CD206 (Bio-Rad, MCA2235, 1:300), Hoechst (sigma, 94403, 1:5000). Secondary antibodies were as follows: Donkey anti-Rat 488 (Invitrogen, A21208, 1:500), Donkey anti-Rabbit 405 (Invitrogen, A48258, 1:500), Donkey anti-Rabbit 568 (Invitrogen, A10042, 1:500), Streptavidin 568 (Invitrogen, S11226, 1:500), Donkey anti-Goat 647 (Invitrogen, A21447, 1:500). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM800 microscope. Antibody-fluorophores covered area and numbers were analyzed by ImageJ. 3D construction was performed using Imaris 9.7.0 software. CD3, IBA1, CD8 and CD11c were labeled and detected with fluorophores using surface area function.

PLX3397 was purchased from SelleckChem. PLX3397 was formulated in the AIN-76A (Research Diet) at a concentration of 400mg/kg chow. E4 and TE4 mice were treated with PLX for 4 weeks for microglial acute depletion from 8.5 to 9.5 months of age.

For blocking IFN-γ signaling, mice were i.p. injected with 100mg/kg body weight with either control IgG (Leinco, P376) or anti-mouse IFN-γ (Leinco, clone H22, I-1190) antibodies 52 every 5 days from 7.5 to 9.5months of age.

For blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling chronically, mice were i.p. injected with 500μg anti-PD-1 antibody (BioXCell, BP0146) every 5 days from 8 to 9.5 months of age. IgG (BioXCell, BP0089) isotype control was administered at the same frequency and dosage. Brains were collected for flow cytometry assessment of T cell populations. To characterize the T cell populations with anti-PD1 treatment, mice were acutely treated with 500 μg anti-PD1 or IgG every 2 days. At day7, after perfusion, brain were isolated for single cell for flow cytometry. Intracellular staining for transcription factors was performed using eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Kit (Ref. 00–5523-00) per manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Ref. L34966A) for 5 min and then incubated with surface antibody mix and TruStain FcX PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/CD32, Clone S17011E, Biolegend, Ref. 156604, 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. After cell-surface staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with intracellular antibody mix overnight at 4°C. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Symphony A3. The following antibodies were used. Biolegend: CD45.2 (104), CD4 (GK1.5), Pd1 (29F.1A12), Klrg1 (2F1/KLRG1). BD: CD3e (145–2C11), CD8a (53–6.7). Invitrogen: Foxp3 (FJK-16s), Tox (TXRX10).

For the depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, mice were i.p. injected with 500μg anti-CD4 (BioXCell, BP0003–1) and anti-CD8 antibody (BioXCell, BP0061) every 5 days from 6 to 9.5 months of age or for memory related behavioral experiments from 6 to 8.5 months of age. IgG (BioXCell, BP0090) isotype control was administered at the same frequency and dosage. To characterize the depletion efficiency, mice were acutely treated with 500 μg anti-CD4, or anti-CD8 or IgG. Brain, meninges and blood were extracted for single cell analysis followed by flow cytometry assessment of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations.

Mouse cortex tissue was weighed and homogenized using a pestle with 10μl buffer/1mg tissue in chilled lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, 78503). After centrifugation at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was saved and protein concentration was measured by micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23235) before multiplex immunoassay (Thermo Scientific).

Group-housed mice were switched to individual housing in the week of assessment at 9.5 months. Pre-weighted nestlet was provided in each cage. After an overnight housing, the remaining nestlet was weighted. The 5-point scale system was included and given based on percentage of remaining nesting material and shredded conditions. Score 1: nestlet >90% untorn; score 2: 50–90% of nestlet is untorn; score 3: 10%−50% of nestlet is untorn; score 4: nestlet <10% untorn, but nest is flat and uncompact; score 5: nest is compact and nest wall is higher than the mouse for >50% of its circumference.

TE4 male mice were treated with IgG or with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies for T cell depletion from 6 to 8.5 months of age. They were then tested for behavioral differences. Following 1 week habituation and handling in the Washington University Animal Behavior Core, mice were evaluated on 1 hour locomotor activity, spontaneous alternation in a Y maze, and fear conditioning. All tests were conducted during the light phase of the light/dark cycle. Behavioral testers were blind to the treatment group.

To evaluate general activity levels and possible alterations in emotionality, mice were evaluated over a 1-h period in transparent (47.6 × 25.4 × 20.6 cm high) polystyrene enclosures. Each cage was surrounded by a frame containing a 4 × 8 matrix of photocell pairs, the output of which was fed to an on-line computer (Hamilton-Kinder, LLC, Poway, CA). The system software (Hamilton-Kinder, LLC) was used to define a 33 × 11 cm central zone and a peripheral or surrounding zone that was 5.5 cm wide with the sides of the cage being the outermost boundary. This peripheral area extended along the entire perimeter of the cage. Variables that were analyzed included the total number of ambulations and rearing on hindlimbs, as well as the number of entries, the time spent, and the distance traveled in the center area as well as the distance traveled in the periphery surrounding the center.

Testing was conducted according to our previously published procedures 53 . Briefly, this involved placing a mouse in the center of a Y-maze that contained three arms that were 10.5 cm wide, 40 cm long and 20.5 cm deep where an arm was oriented at 120° with respect to each successive other arm. Mice were allowed to explore the maze for 10 min and entry into an arm was scored only when the hindlimbs had completely entered the arm. An alternation was defined as any three consecutive choices of three different arms without re-exploration of a previously visited arm. Dependent variables included the number of alternations and arm entries along with the percentage of alternations, which was determined by dividing the total number of alternations by the total number of entries minus 2, then multiplying by 100.

A previously described protocol 54 was used to train and test mice using two clear-plastic conditioning chambers (26×18×18 cm high) (Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) which were easily distinguished by different olfactory, visual, and tactile cues present in each chamber. On day 1, each mouse was placed into the conditioning chamber for 5 min and freezing behavior was quantified during a 2 min baseline period. Freezing (no movement except that associated with respiration) was quantified using FreezeFrame image analysis software (Actimetrics, Evanston, IL) which allows for simultaneous visualization of behavior while adjusting for a “freezing threshold” during 0.75 s intervals. After baseline measurements, a conditioned stimulus (CS) consisting of an 80 dB tone (white noise) was presented for 20 sec followed by an unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a 1 s, 1.0 mA continuous foot shock. This tone-shock (T/S) pairing was repeated each minute over the next 2 min, and freezing was quantified after each of the three tone-shock pairings. Twenty-four hours after training, each mouse was placed back into the original conditioning chamber to test for fear conditioning to the contextual cues in the chamber. This involved quantifying freezing over an 8 min period without the tone or shock being present. Twenty-four hours later, the mice were evaluated on the auditory cue component of the conditioned fear procedure, which included placing each mouse into the other chamber containing distinctly different cues. Freezing was quantified during a 2 min “altered context” baseline period as well as over a subsequent 8 min period during which the auditory cue (CS) was presented. Shock sensitivity was evaluated following completion of the conditioned fear test as previously described 55 .

Plasma NfL concentration was measured with NF-Light Simoa Assay Advantage kit, Quanterix.

Mechanical dissociation was performed as previously described 56 . Briefly, mice were perfused with pre-chilled PBS to fully remove blood contamination. Hippocampus and cortex were dissected followed by Dounce homogenization. Cell suspensions were then passed through Percoll density centrifugation to remove myelin and debris. The cell pellets were washed with 0.5% BSA for analysis or collection. For meninges, meninges were peeled intact from the skullcap using fine forceps and prepared for single cell analysis as previously described 32 . Briefly, meninges were mashed through a cell strainer, using a sterile syringe plunger and washed in 0.5%BSA.

All steps were performed on ice or using pre-chilled centrifuge set to 4°C. Single cell suspensions were incubated with anti-CD16/32 (Fc block; Bio legend) for 5 min then fluorescently conjugated antibodies were added for 20 min. After washing, samples were collected by 300g followed by a 5min spin down and suspended in 5% BSA with PI for live/Dead selection before sorting. Cells were sorted using FACsAria II (BD Bioscience).

After counting and analyzing single cell integrity, 8,000–16,000 individual single cells per sample were loaded onto a 10X Genomics Chromium platform for Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEM) and cDNA generation carrying cell- and transcript-specific barcodes and sequencing libraries constructed using the Chromium Single Cell 5’library & Gel Bead Kit V2. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq6000.

Alignment, barcode assignment, and UMI counting with Cell Ranger (v6.1.1) were used for preparation of count matrices for gene expression library. For alignment, a custom mouse genome (GRCm38) containing human sequences for APOE , PSEN1 , APP , MAPT genes was used as a reference.

Barcodes in all samples that were considered to represent noise and low-quality cells were filtered out using knee-inflection strategy available in default Cell Ranger (v6.1.1) from 10x genomics.

For downstream, Seurat package (v4.0.4) was used, genes which express in less than three cells additionally filtered from expression matrices. The mitochondrial genes fraction was calculated for every cell, and cells with a mitochondrial fraction more than highest confidence interval for scaled mitochondrial percentage were filtered out which results in removal of the cells with mitochondrial percentage more than 20%. Additionally, cut off with log10 (number of unique expressed genes) as 2.5 was used for removing the cells from both CD45 High and CD45 Total parenchyma cells, and 2 was used as a threshold for the cells from meninges.

Doublets have been excluded based on the co-expression of the canonical cell-type specific genes.

Each sample was normalized using SCTransform function with mitochondrial content as a variable to regress out in a second non-regularized linear regression. For integration aims, variable genes across the samples were identified by SelectIntegrationFeatures function with the number of features equal to 2000. Then the object was prepared for integration (PrepSCTIntegration function), the anchors were found (FindIntegrationAnchors function) and the samples were integrated into the whole object (IntegrateData function).

The principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction, and the first 20 principal components (PCs) were used further to generate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction by RunUMAP function. Clustering procedure was performed by FindNeighbors and FindClusters with a range of resolutions (from 0.2 to 1.0 with 0.2 as a step) and the first 20 PCs as input.

The object covering all cells has been subsetted into T-cell, microglia and myeloid specific sub-objects based on expression of canonical gene markers. Additionally, the T-cells object was split into CD4 + and CD8 + cells. Then, all objects passed through the iterative process of quality control with doublets removal and exclusion of the cell typess which have no relevant markers and contained high mitochondrial content as well as poor coverage (all filters are object-specific).

Cell Ranger’s vdj workflow (v6.1.1) was used for TCR data analysis. Non-canonical T cells (such as gamma-delta T cells and natural killer T cells) as well as T cells with inappropriate combinations of alpha/beta chains were removed. Then, all barcodes were assigned to two populations based on CD4 and CD8 gene expression. The Gini coefficient was calculated using the immunarch package (v0.6.6) in order to estimate the clonal diversity among samples.

Trajectory analysis was done using a slingshot container available at dynverse package with normalized count matrices with barcodes assigned to microglia as input data as well as cells assigned to CD8 + T cells.

Interaction analysis was implemented using the CellChat package (v. 1.1.3) with the “Cell-Cell Contact” database. As input data, microglia, CD4 and CD8 T cells from E4 genotype and microglia, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from TE4 genotype were used. Following the CellChat vignette, CellChat objects were prepared (createCellChat), overexpressed genes and interactions were identified (identifyOverExpressedGenes, identifyOverExpressedInteractions functions), communication probabilities were estimated (computeCommunProb, filterCommunication, computeCommunProbPathway functions), and network analysis (aggregateNet, netAnalysis_computeCentrality functions) was performed. The genotype-specific as well as genotype-common ligand-receptor pairs were identified (netVisual_bubble function). The number of interactions were evaluated using netVisual_circle function.

Spleens from E4, A/PE4 and TE4 mice were collected and smashed through a 70micron strainer to prepare single cell suspensions. After single cell suspensions were made, the cells were pelleted down and resuspended in 5ml red blood cell lysis buffer (ACK buffer) at room temperature for 2min. Cells were blocked in the presence of Fc block (2.4G2; Leinco, C247) in magnetic-activated cell-sorting MACS buffer (0.5%BSA, 2mM EDTA in PBS) at 4°C. The following antibodies were used. Biolegend: CD45(30-F11), CD19(6D5), CD3(145–2C11), CD44(IM7), CD4 (PM4–5). BD: CD8 (53–6.7). Invitrogen: FOXP3(FJK-16s).

C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb) 1100Mb/J (OT-I) (Jax, #003831), B6.SJL-Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ (B6. CD45.1) (Jax, #002014) were from Jackson laboratory. OT-1.CD45.1/2 mice were generated by crossing OT-1 and B6.CD45.1 for one generation. 8–12 week old mice were used for the experiment.

To isolate APCs, spleens were chopped into small pieces and digested at 37°C for 45min with buffer containing 0.28U/ml Liberase TM (Roche, 5401119001), 100U/ml Hyaluronidase (Sigma, H3506), and 50U/ml DNase I (Roche, 10104159001) in RMPI1640 (Gibco, 11875093). Cells were pelleted down for CD11c microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec,130–125–835) enrichment based on manufacturer’s instruction. DCs were sorted as CD45 + CD11c + MHC-II high cells.

To enrich OT-1 CD8+ naïve T cells, Naïve CD8α + T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130–096-543) were used for column-based enrichment. OT-1 naïve CD8 + T cells were sorted followed by CD45 + CD3 + CD8 + TCRVβ5 + TCRVα2 + CD62L + CD44 low cells.

Microglia were sorted followed by CD45 low CD11b + cells after single cell collection from brain parenchyma with cortex and hippocampus. CellTrace Violet (5μM, Thermo Fisher, C34571) labeled 25,000 T cells were co-cultured with 20,000 microglia or DCs for 3 days in U-bottom 96-well plate (Corning, 07–200–720). A serial dilution of ovalbumin (Worthington, LS003049) starting from 1000μg/ml (2X dilution) was made and added into the wells. For microglia/OT-1 co-culture, two doses of IFNγ (100ng/ml and 1000ng/ml) were added at the same time. 3 days after, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for T cell proliferation.

Flow cytometry and cell sorting were completed on a FACS CantoII or FACS AriaII instrument and analyzed using Flowjo (v10). Staining was performed at 4°C in the presence of Fc block (2.4G2; Leinco) in magnetic-activated cell-sorting (MACS) buffer (0.5%BSA, 2mM EDTA in PBS). The following antibodies were used. Biolegend: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), CD3 (145–2C11), TCRVβ5 (MR9–4), TCRVα2 (B20.1), CD45.2 (104), CD45.1 (A20), CD44 (IM7), CD8α (53–6.7), CD62L (MEL-14).

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism. Difference between groups were evaluated by Student’s t test, one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests. For conditioned fear behavior, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test. Data expressed as mean ± s.e.m. *** p<0.0001, **p<0.001, *p<0.05, n.s. no significant difference.
