# Title
Sex and gender considerations in dementia: a call for global research

# Abstract
Studies have identified sex and/or gender differences in Alzheimer’s disease, but few have examined other dementias. We highlight sex and gender differences in other dementias, discuss sociocultural factors and provide a framework for future global studies.

## Sex and gender differences in non-AD dementias
LBDs include dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia. LBDs are progressive diseases that are characterized by fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction caused by abnormal deposits of α-synuclein in the brain 3 . The prevalence of LBDs is higher for men than women, at a 4:1 ratio 3 . Hormonal mechanisms may account for some of this difference; animal studies suggest that estrogen protects dopaminergic neurons from susceptibility to α-synuclein aggregation 4 . Several environmental risk factors have been identified, including exposure to pesticides, water pollutants and lifestyle factors (for example, smoking, sedentarism and head trauma). However, little is known about how sex and gender affect exposure to environmental risk factors and subsequent LBD risk – particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where (for example) there are higher levels of ambient and indoor air pollution. Future studies should assess the intersection of sex and gender with social, cultural and environmental factors for the risk of LBDs, which varies globally.

FTD encompasses clinical syndromes that are characterized by changes in behavior, personality or language. Clinical phenotypes include behavioral-variant FTD, semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA), non-fluent variant PPA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with FTD (ALS–FTD). Behavioral-variant FTD is more common in male individuals than female individuals, but sex differences in PPA subtypes are inconclusive. Studies of sex or gender differences in clinical presentations have yielded mixed findings. Some studies (for example, ref. 5 ) have reported worse cognitive performance in female individuals with behavioral-variant FTD or PPA, whereas another study has suggested women demonstrate greater cognitive resilience to FTD pathology 6 . Sex-specific genetic risk factors may exist. A meta-analysis found a higher female prevalence of C9orf72 mutations, the most common known genetic cause of both ALS and FTD 7 . Sex differences in the prevalence of sporadic versus genetic behavioral-variant FTD have also been reported 8 . It is vital for future research to examine the influence of gender on the risk and presentation of FTD, especially from a global perspective, because social acceptance of the behavioral symptoms due to FTD varies.

The term VCID broadly refers to cognitive dysfunction caused by cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, subclinical vascular brain injury and silent brain infarction. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and depends on the etiology and location of the injury. Although some VCID studies have reported a higher prevalence in men, others have not reported a sex difference. Discrepancies are probably due to cohort-specific characteristics 9 .

Sex and gender differences in cardiovascular risk factors and response to treatments exist, but the effect of these differences on incident VCID are not well understood. Although the prevalence of mid-life cardiovascular risk factors is higher in men than women, their effects on mid-life cognitive decline may be greater for women 10 . In addition, female-specific cardiovascular risk factors that affect cognition (for example, pregnancy-related disorders and early menopause) should be considered. Knowledge of sex or gender differences in the prevalence and risk of VCID in low- and middle-income countries is scarce. It is important to investigate cultural and social factors that contribute to differences in VCID risk worldwide, including access to treatments and psychosocial stress.

## Proposed research framework
Current operationalization of sex and gender measurements in dementia research. Sex and gender are complex phenomena; their consideration in dementia research has been both inconsistent and challenging. Sex (biological, physiological and genetic differences between male and female individuals) and gender (a social construct that reflects environmental, psychosocial and cultural influences) are still often used interchangeably 1 . As a result, independent or synergistic determinants of sex or gender on dementia risk are not well understood. For example, the intersectionality of pathophysiological mechanisms with historical trajectories of socioeconomic determinants of AD (for example, educational attainment, occupational complexity or gender-associated roles such as caregiving) is unknown. Notably, race and ethnicity interact with sex and gender, but this intersection is not commonly considered in dementia research. Further, most studies adopt a binary approach to the measurement of sex or gender without considering the existence of nonbinary populations. Lastly, many studies still merely ‘adjust’ for sex or gender rather than assessing differences using interactions.

Although studies are beginning to examine sex and gender differences in risk factors for AD dementia 1 , and the efficacy of risk-reduction measures ( Fig. 1 ), this work has rarely extended to other types of dementia. Future research must consider the limitations and challenges of the current operationalization of sex and gender measurements in dementia research.

Several factors may influence the accuracy of results for studies that examine sex and gender differences in AD and other dementias 11 . One issue is the misclassification of dementia subtypes, which occurs at both younger and older ages – particularly in studies with only clinical diagnoses and without in vivo biomarkers or brain autopsy. It has been estimated that over 95% of individuals with probable AD have mixed pathologies, and types of copathology may vary by sex and/or gender. For example, a neuropathological study of community-dwelling older adults reported women were significantly more likely to have combined AD and cardiovascular pathology, whereas men were more likely to have ‘pure’ LBDs 12 . Another study showed that men were more likely to have hippocampal sparing neurofibrillary tangle pathology, whereas women were more likely to have limbic predominant; the atypical pathological presentation in men – and corresponding atypical clinical presentation – led to an underdiagnosis of clinical AD for men 13 . A second issue is the identification of sex and gender differences in cognitive reserve and resilience to AD pathology 14 ; additional research is needed to elucidate the sex-related factors (for example, sex chromosomes or hormones) and gendered experiences (for example, education, occupation or gender roles) that contribute to reserve and resilience, especially in non-AD dementias.

Another challenge relates to inferential errors from epidemiological studies (for example, inadequate consideration of survival or selection bias by sex or gender) and death as a competing risk. Women live longer than men and, therefore, have a longer timeframe to accrue a dementia diagnosis. Thus, the lifetime risk of AD for women is greater than for men – a finding that is widely reported in the literature, including across diverse populations (reviewed in ref. 2 ) – but the age-specific prevalence may not be. It is important to explicitly account for systematic bias and error when describing sex and gender differences in dementia prevalence and risk factors.

Additional analytic methods should also be considered. First, to overcome construct-validity issues caused by the dichotomous classification of sex or gender, instruments that feature questions relating to ‘sex assigned at birth’ and ‘current gender one identifies with’ may be more accurate. Next, rather than adjusting for sex, analytical strategies should examine effect modification that includes interactions of the investigated variables with sex, as well as mediation analysis that adopts a causal framework to examine gender-related mechanisms of sex differences. Finally, for a true comprehension of sex and gender differences across dementias, further research that includes wider geographical and culturally representative sampling across global populations and alongside multinational comparisons of sociocultural influences is essential, as recently shown 15 .

## Summary and future directions
Dementia represents a global challenge – particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the number of older people is predicted to rise substantially owing to increases in life expectancy. Growing evidence suggests that there are sex and gender differences in AD risk, but research examining differences in non-AD dementias has been limited. In this Comment, we reviewed current evidence for sex and gender differences in LBDs, FTD and VCID; highlighted the need to examine geographical and sociocultural factors; and provided a framework of important considerations when examining sex and gender differences for dementia. Identifying global drivers of sex and gender differences in AD and other dementias is a crucial step for developing interventions that are unique to each geographical and sociocultural area, to reduce dementia disparities and inequities.
