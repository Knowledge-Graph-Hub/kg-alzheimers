Single-cell atlas reveals correlates of high cognitive function, dementia, and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment remain poorly understood. To address this, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex covering 2.3 million cells from post-mortem human brain samples of 427 individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology and cognitive impairment. Our analyses identified AD pathology-associated alterations shared between excitatory neuron subtypes, revealed a coordinated increase of the cohesin complex and DNA damage response factors in excitatory neurons and in oligodendrocytes, and uncovered genes and pathways associated with high cognitive function, dementia, and resilience to AD pathology. Furthermore, we identified selectively vulnerable somatostatin inhibitory neuron subtypes depleted in AD, discovered two distinct groups of inhibitory neurons that were more abundant in individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life, and uncovered a link between inhibitory neurons and resilience to AD pathology.

## INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia 1 . It is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorder, starting with mild memory loss and culminating in severe impairment of broad executive and cognitive functions 3 , 4 . The pathological hallmarks of AD encompass a range of clinical presentations and cellular pathologies, including β-amyloid accumulation, paired helical filament (PHF) tau neurofibrillary tangles, glial cell activation, and neuronal and synaptic loss 5 - 10 .

Single-cell atlases have proven to be very informative for unraveling the biology of aging 11 and the etiology of diseases like COVID-19 12 by permitting a systematic investigation of how different cell types are impacted. For AD, however, single-cell studies have only been conducted on small groups of 10 to 21 individuals and thus did not capture the full spectrum of distinct types of AD pathology, cognitive decline, and end-stage cognition observed in the general older population 13 - 17 . Analyses of the aged human brain across larger unbiased cohorts are needed to capture this variability and answer central questions such as: What distinguishes individuals who age in a healthy way and do not show signs of cognitive impairment from individuals who develop dementia? Which cell types are particularly vulnerable to AD pathology burden, and can their loss explain cognitive impairment? Which genes and pathways are particularly active in individuals who maintain high cognitive function late in life, sometimes despite high levels of Alzheimer’s disease pathology 18 , 19 ? Understanding the biology behind cognitive decline versus preserved cognitive function late in life is crucial because it may lead to opportunities for therapeutic development.

Here, we address this challenge by reporting the insights gained from a comprehensive single-cell molecular atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex across 2.3 million nuclei isolated from 427 study participants of two longitudinal cohort studies of aging and dementia (ROSMAP) 20 . We capitalize on ROSMAP's rich clinical data and detailed post-mortem pathological evaluations to determine cellular and molecular correlates of high cognitive function, dementia, and resilience to AD pathology. We report transcriptomic differences associated with multiple measures of AD pathology, identify AD-associated alterations conserved across excitatory neuron subtypes, and uncover a coordinated increase of the cohesin complex and the cellular response to DNA damage in excitatory neurons and in oligodendrocytes. Tracking compositional differences in neuronal subtypes across the spectrum of AD pathology and cognitive impairment, we identify selectively vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtypes depleted in AD, identify two distinct groups of inhibitory neurons that are more abundant in individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life, and uncover a link between inhibitory neurons and resilience to AD pathology.

## RESULTS
We used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to profile more than 2.3 million nuclei isolated from the prefrontal cortex of post-mortem brain tissue of 427 participants in the Religious Order Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) ( Figures 1A and 1B ). The sample of 427 study participants included individuals across a range of AD progression, from non-AD and early-AD (N=115, Braak Stages 0,I,II) to intermediate (N=198, Stages III-IV) and late-AD (N=114, Stages V-VI) ( Figures 1A and 1B ). Based on the clinical consensus diagnosis of cognitive status at the time of death, 146 study participants were diagnosed with no cognitive impairment, 102 with mild cognitive impairment, and 144 with AD dementia ( Figure 1B ). The distribution of categorical and quantitative measures of AD- and other pathologies, as well as quantitative clinical phenotypes in the cohort of 427 study participants ( Figure 1C ) closely reflected that of the entire ROSMAP cohort ( Data S1 , page 1A - 1Q ).

After removal of doublets (using Scrublet) and low-quality cells, a total of 2,359,994 cells remained in the final dataset ( Figure 1D ). Based on Leiden clustering, marker gene analysis, and comparisons with previously published data 21 we annotated 54 high-resolution cell types in 12 major groups ( Figure S1 and Data S1 , page 1R and 1S ). These included 14 excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc, 1,043,230 cells, 44.2% of total); 25 inhibitory neuron subtypes (Inh, 329,699, 14.0%); oligodendrocytes (645,142 cells, 27.5%); oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs, 90,502, 3.8%); 3 astrocyte subtypes (149,558, 6.3%); 5 immune cell types, including microglia, CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), and T cells (83,889, 3.6%); and several vascular cell types (17,974, 0.8%) including endothelial (End), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblast (Fib), and pericyte (Per) subpopulations ( Figures 1F - 1J ) (see the accompanying manuscript by Sun, Victor et al. 22 for a more detailed analysis of microglial cellular states). Transcriptomic cell types were largely conserved across individuals, as most of the identified cellular subsets contained nuclei from the large majority of donors ( Data S1 , page 1R and 1S ).

To determine how individual cell types are affected by different clinical and life-style variables, we analyzed the differential gene expression in our 54 cell types with regard to each variable. We considered multiple measures of AD pathology, Lewy body and TDP-43 pathology, vascular pathology, medical conditions, and cognitive, physical, and social life-style variables ( Figure 2A ). After correcting for the level of global AD pathology, few genes were significantly associated with non-AD-pathology variables in any cell type ( Figure 2A ). One notable exception was diabetes, which exhibited a remarkably cell-type-specific association with gene expression alterations in oligodendrocytes ( Figures 2A and Data S1 , page 2 ). We also observed sex-specific responses to AD pathology ( Data S1 , page 2H ), consistent with previous observations 23 .

We subsequently focused our analysis on the AD pathology variables because of the large number of genes associated with these measures ( Figure 2A ). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs; adjusted P value < 0.05) significantly associated with AD pathology were identified in nearly all cell types ( Figure 2A ) with the largest numbers of DEGs detected for measures of neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden ( Figures 2A ). When comparing DEGs associated with different types of AD pathology, we observed a significant overlap of genes positively or negatively associated with global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle burden, and tangle density in many neuronal subtypes, as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes ( Figures 2B - 2F and S2A ), and the effect sizes of gene expression changes were strongly correlated between variables ( Figures S2B and S2C ). Thus, our results highlight large AD pathology-associated consensus signatures that are reproducibly detectable across multiple distinct measures of AD pathology within many different cell types. We also found a significant overlap of DEGs associated with AD pathology between different excitatory neuron subtypes ( Figures 2G , 2H , and S2D - S2G ). The overlap of AD-associated genes between excitatory neuron subtypes was also indicated by self-organizing map (SOM) analyses of gene-trait correlations ( Methods S1 , page 1A ), was broadly observed across the expression level spectrum ( Data S1 , page 3A ), and was further confirmed using a permutation test ( Data S1 , page 3B and 3C ).

To validate our differential expression results, we compared them to those of previously published single-nucleus RNA sequencing studies of Alzheimer's disease 15 , 16 , 24 , 25 and found a significant positive correlation for gene expression changes across multiple cell types, with particularly high concordance between our results and those of other studies analyzing the PFC ( Data S1 , page 3D - 3G ). To further test the robustness and generalizability of our results, we divided the full cohort into two non-overlapping random subsets and found a highly significant overlap of differentially expressed genes between the results of the original analysis across the entire cohort and both random sub-cohorts ( Data S1 , page 4A ). Furthermore, the association scores and effect sizes of significant DEGs were strongly correlated between the full cohort and both sub-cohorts ( Data S1 , page 4B and 4C ). We also confirmed that the observed associations between gene expression and global AD pathology remained significant after accounting for additional potential confounding factors such as technical variability, sex, diabetes, and after removing ambient RNA using DecontX 26 ( Data S1 , page 4D - 4F ).

The results of the differential expression analysis, both from the original analysis and the analysis involving the removal of ambient RNA and adjustment for sex and unwanted sources of variation, are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/mathyslab7/ROSMAP_snRNAseq_PFC ).

To further validate the results of our differential gene expression analysis, we analyzed a separate large single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 424 ROSMAP study participants (referred to as the De Jager dataset) 27 , 28 . A permutation test revealed a highly significant overlap of global AD pathology associated DEGs between the two datasets ( Data S1 , page 5A ). We extended our validation to a different brain region using a snRNA-seq dataset derived from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) (referred to as the SEA-AD dataset) 29 . Interestingly, we observed that a large fraction of genes confirmed to be altered in the prefrontal cortex by both our dataset and the De Jager dataset were also significantly associated with the continuous pseudo-progression score of AD severity in the MTG dataset ( Data S1 , page 5B and 5C ). This compelling agreement across different cohorts and brain regions serves as a testament to the robustness and generalizability of our findings.

To identify the genes, pathways, and biological processes recurrently altered across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes, we defined a consensus signature of genes significantly associated with global AD pathology in at least three different excitatory neuron subtypes. The consensus signature positively associated with global AD pathology was enriched for genes involved in neuron projection morphogenesis, mRNA metabolic processes, chromatin organization, and synaptic signaling ( Figure 3A ). Consensus signature genes associated with synaptic signaling were further examined in the context of synaptic location using the SynGO database 30 and the results suggested that gene expression alterations in AD involve both the pre-and postsynaptic compartments ( Figures S3A - S3E ). We confirmed that many of the synaptic genes positively associated with AD pathology were also upregulated in a published dataset of gene expression from neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing neurons compared to NFT-free somas ( Figure S3F ) 31 . However, analysis of expression changes based on quantitative proteomics revealed a decrease of many of the synaptic genes in AD brains, potentially suggesting that the greater expression of these genes in neuronal nuclei reflects a homeostatic response possibly as a reaction to synaptic degeneration in the neuronal periphery ( Figure S3G ) 2 . Consistent with this hypothesis, genes negatively associated with multiple measures of AD pathology across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes were confirmed to be decreased in AD brains based on quantitative proteomics ( Figures S3H - S3K ) 2 , a finding that was further supported by cell type-specific RT-qPCR ( Data S1 , page 6A ) and multiplex RNA in situ hybridization ( Data S1 , page 7A - 7C ). Other consensus signature genes positively associated with global AD pathology annotated to be involved in mRNA metabolic processes centered around the spliceosome and included the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins HNRNPA2B1 and HNRNPH3 ( Figure 3C ). A significant upregulation of HNRNPA2B1 in individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD was corroborated using RT-qPCR ( Data S1 , page 6B and 6C ) and multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization ( Data S1 , page 7D and 7E ).

The consensus signature negatively associated with global AD pathology was enriched for genes involved in tRNA metabolic processes and metabolism of lipids ( Figure 3B ). Genes negatively associated with multiple measures of AD pathology across multiple cell types included the lipid metabolism genes BDH1, GPCPD1, MECR, and TM7SF2, which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis ( Figure 3E ). Consistent with these results, RT-qPCR on neuronal nuclei confirmed a significant downregulation of BDH1 and GPCPD1 in individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD ( Data S1 , page 6D and 6E ). While the consensus signature is based on gene expression differences in excitatory neurons, dysregulation of lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis genes was also evident in astrocytes ( Figure 3F ), an observation that was further supported by immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue ( Data S1 , page 8A - 8C ). Alterations in lipid metabolism were accompanied by widespread changes of genes encoding the mitochondrial electron transport chain components and individuals with a high level of AD pathology exhibited a decreased expression of several genes encoding components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB), a complex that is of central importance for the maintenance of mitochondrial inner membrane architecture ( Figures 3G , 3H , and Data S1 , page 8D ) 32 . Our findings collectively point to several metabolic processes and facets of mitochondrial biology that may be compromised in AD and may contribute to cellular dysfunction in astrocytes and multiple neuronal subtypes.

The gene expression differences related to synaptic signaling, RNA splicing, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function observed in the PFC were largely confirmed in a separate dataset derived from the middle temporal gyrus 29 ( Figures 3D and Data S1 , page 6F - 6I ), and were further supported by bulk RNA sequencing data from the ROSMAP cohorts (n = 638), quantitative proteomics data 2 ( Data S1 , page 6J - 6O ), and a group-based differential expression analysis ( Methods S1 , page 2 and page 3 ).

We performed an additional analysis focused on identifying AD-associated gene expression alterations that exhibit more cell type specificity. We defined cell-type-restricted DEGs as genes significantly altered in no more than two cell types and found that a considerable fraction of DEGs fell within this category ( Methods S1 , page 4A - 4C ). We successfully identified cell type-restricted AD-associated gene expression changes not only at the level of major cell types but also among excitatory subtypes and inhibitory neuron subclasses ( Methods S1 , page 4D - 4F ) and confirmed a large fraction of these alterations in the SEA-AD dataset ( Methods S1 , page 4G and 4H ).

To evaluate whether AD affects additional protein complexes besides the MIB complex, we computed module scores for 2,417 human protein complexes from CORUM 33 and tested their association with global AD pathology. Cohesin, a protein complex that regulates sister chromatid cohesion, homologous recombination, and DNA looping, was most consistently and significantly elevated across excitatory neuron subtypes from the PFC of individuals with high levels of AD pathology ( Figures 4A and S4A - S4C ) and was also positively associated with global AD pathology in PFC oligodendrocytes ( Figure 4A ). Increased expression of the cohesin complex in individuals with high levels of AD pathology was also observed in a subset of excitatory neuron subtypes in other brain regions ( Figure 4A ) and further confirmed based on bulk RNA sequencing data from the ROSMAP cohorts (n = 638) ( Figure 4B ), RT-qPCR analysis ( Figure S4D ), and quantitative proteomics data ( Figure 4C ) 2 .

To explore the context and possible function of increased cohesin expression in AD, we computed the correlation between the cohesin complex and all expressed genes across excitatory neuron cell types. Interestingly, many genes positively correlated with the cohesin complex including the chromatin regulators ATRX, ZBTB1, SIRT1, CHD1, BPTF, and ZBTB7A have been reported to play a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage ( Figures 4D and S4E ) 34 - 42 . Other genes positively correlated with the cohesin complex are recruited to sites of DNA damage (NIPBL) 43 , regulate base excision repair (USP47) 44 , promote DNA damage recovery (BAZ1B) 45 , regulate the DNA damage response (CDKN2AIP) 46 , and play a critical role in DNA damage repair (MACROD1) 47 ( Figures 4D and S4E ). Many of these genes were themselves positively associated with multiple measures of AD pathology across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes and were also positively correlated with cohesin complex expression in excitatory neurons in other brain regions ( Figures S4F - S4H and Data S1 , page 9A - 9C ). A coordinated increase in the expression of the cohesin complex and DNA damage response genes in AD was also observed in oligodendrocytes ( Figures 4E - 4G and Data S1 , page 9D ). These results indicate that the AD-associated increase in expression of the cohesin complex is accompanied by elevated expression of a plethora of chromatin regulators and DNA damage response factors that promote genome integrity, an observation that is consistent with the results presented in the accompanying manuscripts by Dileep and colleagues 48 and Xiong and colleagues 49 . Collectively, our findings indicate that the deterioration of the genome and epigenome integrity may constitute important pathological events in the pathogenesis of AD.

To deepen our analysis of molecular changes associated with AD progression, we split the entire cohort into three groups based on the AD pathology variable of interest and determined DEGs comparing the second group to the first group of individuals with the lowest level of AD pathology and the third group with the highest level of AD pathology to the second group ( Figure 5A ). We observed a convergence in gene expression changes associated with different types of AD pathology, as well as a significant overlap of DEGs between excitatory neuron subtypes, at both the early and late stages of disease progression ( Data S1 , page 10A - 10C ), consistent with the results based on the entire cohort of individuals.

To examine AD progression at the molecular level, we intersected genes linked to AD pathology across the entire cohort with the DEGs determined based on the disease stage-specific differential expression analysis ( Figure 5A ). Many DEGs identified across the cohort also showed significant changes at early or late disease stages ( Figure S5A ). Across multiple cell types, early changes positively associated with AD pathology were enriched for genes involved in synapse organization, regulation of cell projection organization, chromatin organization, and DNA damage response ( Figures 5B and S5B ), whereas genes involved in cell activation were enriched only in microglia ( Figure S5C ). Genes involved in autophagy were enriched among early changes negatively associated with AD pathology in astrocytes, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs ( Figures 5C and S5E ). Late changes positively associated with AD pathology were enriched for genes involved in mRNA metabolic processes, chromatin organization, DNA damage response, cell projection organization, synaptic signaling, and protein catabolic processes in neurons ( Figures 5B and S5B ), cholesterol metabolism in oligodendrocytes, and cell activation, regulation of defense response, and the TYROBP causal network in microglia ( Figures S5C and S5D ). Conversely, genes negatively associated with AD pathology at a late stage of disease progression were enriched for lipid metabolism genes in astrocytes, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and oligodendrocytes ( Figures 5C and S5F ).

We also performed a similar analysis in the SEA-AD dataset splitting the cohort into three groups based on the continuous pseudo-progression score of each individual 29 . We then looked at a subset of genes that were significant across multiple cell types in both PFC and MTG and found that many of them were significantly associated with global AD pathology across multiple neuronal and glial cell types at the late stage of disease progression ( Figure 5E ). Consistent with these observations, we found that the cohesin complex expression tended to increase with AD progression and was significantly elevated in the individuals with the highest level of global AD pathology ( Figure 5D ). Finally, we explored disease progression in AD by comparing gene expression alterations between the PFC and the MTG datasets. Early changes considerably overlapped between the datasets ( Figure 5G ) and intriguingly, a sizable fraction of the genes that were significant at a late stage of disease progression in the PFC were also significantly altered at an early stage in the MTG ( Figure 5E and 5F ). These observations indicate that gene expression alterations in Alzheimer’s disease are at least partially shared between different brain regions and may indicate that similar molecular alterations happen with different temporal patterns in different regions of the brain.

Next, we explore what distinguishes individuals who age in a healthy way and do not show signs of cognitive impairment from those who develop dementia. To determine the molecular correlates of cognitive impairment in the aged human brain, we analyzed differential gene expression in individual cell types with regard to a summary measure of global cognitive function as well as measures of individual cognitive domains and the person-specific rate of change in these variables over time. DEGs significantly associated with cognition were identified in nearly all cell types ( Figure 6A ) with the largest number of DEGs associated with measures of global cognitive function and episodic memory. Genes associated with distinct cognition variables overlapped significantly in most excitatory neuron cell types, a subset of inhibitory neuron subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. These genes also overlapped significantly with AD pathology-associated genes, suggesting that within a given cell type, the gene expression alterations associated with cognitive impairment closely reflect AD pathology-associated changes ( Figures 6B , S6A ). Accordingly, DEGs associated with global cognitive function significantly overlapped between different excitatory neuron subtypes ( Figure S6B ).

Just as we had done for genes associated with AD pathology, we also determined a consensus signature of genes significantly associated with global cognitive function in at least three different excitatory neuron subtypes. The consensus signature positively associated with global cognitive function was enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism, whereas the negatively associated consensus signature included genes involved in synaptic signaling and neuron projection development ( Figures S6C and S6D ). Genes involved in lipid metabolism, particularly cholesterol biosynthesis, were also associated with global cognitive function in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with astrocytes showing positive associations, while oligodendrocytes exhibited the opposite trend ( Figures S6D and S6E ). To further characterize synaptic genes significantly associated with global cognitive function, we examined consensus signature genes in the context of synaptic location using the SynGO database 30 . Negatively associated genes exhibited the most significant enrichment for postsynaptic terms ( Figures S6F ), while genes positively associated with global cognitive function, including CACNG3, PAK1, NPTX2, RPH3A, SVOP, and BDNF, mapped to both the pre-and postsynaptic compartments ( Figure 6C - 6E ). Examination of prefrontal cortex tissue using RNA in situ hybridization ( Figure 6F ) and immunohistochemistry ( Figure 6G ) confirmed a significant reduction in NPTX2 expression among individuals with cognitive impairment. Additional synaptic genes positively associated with global cognitive function included NUMB and VGF ( Figures 6D and 6E ), a finding that was further corroborated through RT-qPCR ( Data S1 , page 11 A ) and immunohistochemical analysis ( Data S1 , page 11B and 11C ). Finally, we observed that several genes involved in FGF signaling were positively associated with multiple measures of cognition across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes ( Figures 6D and 6E ). In summary, our results highlight common and cell type specific genes, pathways, and cellular components associated with high cognitive function and dementia in the aged human brain.

Cognitive resilience (CR) has been defined as the continuum of better (or worse) than expected cognition, given the degree of neuropathology 19 , 50 , 51 . To identify potential molecular mediators that confer resilience to AD pathology, we next investigated what distinguishes the brains of individuals with high cognitive resilience from individuals who are more susceptible to AD pathology. To determine the genes linked to cognitive resilience in the aged human brain, we analyzed differential gene expression in excitatory neuron subtypes with regard to the cognitive resilience (CR) and cognitive decline resilience (CDR) measures (see methods) ( Methods S1 , page 5A and 5B ). DEGs significantly associated with cognitive resilience were identified in multiple excitatory neuron subtypes ( Methods S1 , page 5C ). We identified 5 genes (HES4, PDE10A, RPH3A, ST6GAL2, and UST) that were differentially expressed relative to at least one cognitive resilience measure in at least 8 excitatory neuron cell types ( Methods S1 , page 5D and 5E ). Interestingly, UST is a predicted target of the MEF2 family of transcription factors which we have recently identified as key regulators of cognitive resilience 52 . These genes were also robustly differentially expressed relative to all the cognitive resilience measures in at least 1 excitatory cell type ( Methods S1 , page 5D and 5E ). Greater expression of these genes in resilient individuals was further confirmed based on an overrepresentation analysis ( Methods S1 , page 5F - 5K ), bulk RNA-sequencing data from the ROSMAP cohorts ( Methods S1 , page 5L - 5O ), RT-qPCR analysis of RNA isolated from PFC post-mortem tissue ( Methods S1 , page 5P ), and a group-based differential expression analysis comparing individuals with both pathologic and cognitive diagnoses of AD versus individuals with no cognitive impairment despite a pathologic diagnosis of AD ( Methods S1 , page 5Q ). In conclusion, these analyses highlight a small set of genes whose expression is linked to cognitive resilience in multiple excitatory neuron subtypes.

Cell death is the ultimate form of cellular dysfunction, and is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. We investigated how cell type composition is affected with the progression of AD pathology to identify particularly vulnerable cell types. First, we assessed whether the proportions of major cell types change with the progression of AD pathology and found that the relative abundance of most major cell types did not significantly change ( Figures 7A and 7B , and Data S1 , page 12A and 12B ). One exception was the population of microglial cells that exhibited a significant increase in its relative abundance in individuals with the highest levels of global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, and overall amyloid level ( Figures 7A and 7B , and Data S1 , page 12A - 12D ). By contrast, excitatory neurons trended towards a subtle decrease in their relative abundance with the progression of AD pathology, reaching significance when considering the neocortex-specific measure of global AD pathology ( Figures 7A and 7B , and Data S1 , page 12B ).

To identify particularly vulnerable and resilient cell types, we next evaluated changes in cell type composition with the progression of AD pathology at the level of high-resolution cell types. We identified three selectively vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtypes of the SST subclass (Inh CUX2 MSR1, Inh ENOX2 SPHKAP, and Inh L3-5 SST MAFB) that were significantly overrepresented in the subset of individuals with the lowest levels of global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, diffuse plaque burden, overall amyloid level, neurofibrillary tangle burden, tangle density, and in individuals without a pathologic diagnosis of AD ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, UMAP representation of inhibitory neurons revealed that the three vulnerable SST subtypes clustered next to each other, suggesting that these subtypes are characterized by a high degree of transcriptomic similarity, potentially explaining the shared vulnerability to AD pathology ( Figure 7D ). Consistent with the results of the overrepresentation analysis, the relative abundance of the entire subclass of SST inhibitory neurons, as well as the relative abundance of individual subtypes of the group of selectively vulnerable SST neurons, was significantly decreased in the subset of individuals with the highest levels of global AD pathology, neurofibrillary tangle burden, and tangle density, a finding that was further confirmed using a quasi-binomial regression model ( Figures 7E and 7F , and Data S1 , page 13A - 13D ). The relative abundance of many excitatory neuron subtypes trended towards a decrease with the progression of AD pathology but did not reach significance ( Data S1 , page 13E and 13F ).

To further validate the changes in cell type composition, we integrated our data with the De Jager dataset, generating a snRNA-seq dataset of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) encompassing 615 individuals. Analyzing the combined dataset using quasi-binomial regression we confirmed a decrease in the relative abundance of the entire subclass of SST inhibitory neurons and all three vulnerable SST neuron subtypes in individuals with higher levels of AD pathology ( Data S1 , page 13G and 13H ). In summary, our results highlight the subclass of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and most notably three of its subtypes, as particularly vulnerable to AD pathology.

We next utilized our large-scale dataset to examine cell type composition differences between individuals who maintain high cognitive function late in life and those with dementia. The relative abundance of inhibitory neurons trended to be highest in the subset of individuals with the highest level of global cognitive function and was significantly decreased in the subset of individuals with the lowest scores in the cognitive domains perceptual orientation and semantic memory ( Data S1 , page 14A - 14D ). Likewise, the relative abundance of excitatory neurons was significantly decreased in the subset of individuals with the lowest scores in the cognitive domain perceptual orientation ( Data S1 , page 14B and 14D ).

Next, we explored differences in cell type composition associated with cognitive decline at the level of high-resolution cell types. We identified multiple inhibitory neuron subtypes, including the vulnerable SST neurons, that were significantly overrepresented in the subset of individuals with the highest level of global cognitive function, episodic memory, and semantic memory ( Figure 7G ). Additional inhibitory neuron subtypes overrepresented in individuals with high cognitive function included the RELN-positive inhibitory neurons of the LAMP5 subclass (Inh LAMP5 RELN), the subtype marked by the expression of PTPRK and FAM19A1 (Inh PTPRK FAM19A1), and the subtype marked by the expression of SORCS1 and TTN (Inh SORCS1 TTN) ( Figure 7G ). UMAP representation of inhibitory neurons revealed that the three inhibitory neuron subtypes Inh LAMP5 RELN, Inh PTPRK FAM19A1, and Inh SORCS1 TTN (hereafter referred to as LAMP5 RELN group) clustered next to each other, suggesting a high degree of transcriptomic similarity between these subtypes ( Figure 7D ). The relative abundance of the entire LAMP5 RELN group of inhibitory neurons and the entire subclass of SST inhibitory neurons was significantly decreased in individuals scoring low on tests of global cognitive function, episodic memory, perceptual orientation, and semantic memory ( Figures 7H and Data S1 , page 15A ). These findings were further supported by additional group-based analyses comparing individuals with high versus low cognitive function and by quasi-binomial regression analysis ( Figures 8I and 8J, and Data S1 , page 15B - 15D ). In general, we did not find a significant association between the relative abundance of excitatory neuron subtypes and cognitive function, except for layer 2/3 (L2-3) excitatory neurons (Exc L2-3 CBLN2 LINC02306), which were positively associated with the measure of perceptual orientation ( Data S1 , page 16A and 16B ).

In summary, our analysis uncovered two distinct groups of inhibitory neuron subtypes that are more abundant in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life. These findings were further supported by a quasi-binomial regression analysis of the combined snRNA-seq dataset encompassing 615 individuals ( Data S1 , page 16C - 16E ).

Finally, we explored what distinguishes the brains of individuals with cognitive resilience to AD pathology in terms of cell type composition. We found that the relative abundance of inhibitory neurons was significantly higher in individuals with high cognitive resilience to global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, and neurofibrillary tangle burden ( Figure S7A ). Consistent with this observation, among individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD, the relative abundance of inhibitory neurons was significantly higher in individuals without cognitive impairment compared to individuals with a diagnosis of AD dementia ( Figure 7K ). This finding was further supported by quasi-binomial regression analysis ( Figure S7B ) and RNA in situ hybridization analysis on prefrontal cortex tissue samples ( Figure 7L ).

We then asked whether cognitive resilience to AD pathology is associated with specific subclasses and subtypes of inhibitory neurons? RELN-positive inhibitory neurons of the LAMP5 subclass were significantly overrepresented in the subset of individuals with the highest level of cognitive resilience to global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle burden, and tangle density ( Figure S7C ). The remaining subtypes of the LAMP5 RELN group of inhibitory neurons and the vulnerable SST subtypes also tended to be overrepresented in individuals with high cognitive resilience to AD pathology ( Figure S7C ). The relative abundance of the SST subclass of inhibitory neurons was significantly higher in individuals with high cognitive resilience to global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, and neurofibrillary tangle burden ( Figure S7D - S7F ). Among individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD, the relative abundance of the vulnerable SST neurons was significantly higher in individuals without cognitive impairment compared to individuals with a diagnosis of AD dementia ( Figure 7M ). Focusing on the LAMP5 RELN group of inhibitory neurons, we found that the relative abundance of the entire group and two of its subtypes (Inh LAMP5 RELN and Inh PTPRK FAM19A1) was significantly higher in individuals with high cognitive resilience to global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle burden, and tangle density ( Figures 7N and S7G ). Furthermore, among individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD, the relative abundance of the individual subtypes of the LAMP5 RELN group was significantly higher in individuals without cognitive impairment compared to individuals with a diagnosis of AD dementia ( Figure 7O ). These findings were further supported by quasi-binomial regression analysis ( Data S1 , page 17A - 17C ), RT-qPCR ( Data S1 , page 17D ), chromogenic RNA in situ hybridization ( Data S1 , page 17E - 17G ), immunohistochemical analysis ( Data S1 , page 18A - 18C ), a quasi-binomial regression analysis of the combined dataset across 615 individuals ( Data S1 , page 18D - 18F ), and multiplex RNA in situ hybridization analysis of post-mortem prefrontal cortex tissue ( Data S1 , page 19 ).

In summary, our analysis revealed that inhibitory neurons, and in particular two distinct subgroups associated with high cognitive function (LAMP5 RELN group and vulnerable SST subtypes), are more abundant in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with high cognitive resilience to AD pathology.

## DISCUSSION
In this work, we present a transcriptomic atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex from 427 ROSMAP study participants with varying degrees of Alzheimer’s disease progression, cognitive impairment, and resilience to AD pathology. Our analysis of the single-cell resolution data from this large cohort enabled us to annotate the cellular diversity of the human prefrontal cortex, identify AD pathology-associated gene expression alterations shared between excitatory neuron subtypes, and pinpoint alterations in the expression of genes involved in critical and fundamental cellular processes, including synaptic signaling, chromatin organization, metabolism of lipids, mRNA and tRNA metabolic processes, and mitochondrial function. Systematic analysis of protein complex expression changes along the progression of AD pathology revealed a coordinated increase of the cohesin complex and the cellular response to DNA damage in excitatory neurons and in oligodendrocytes. Our big data set enabled us to identify genes and pathways associated with high cognitive performance and discover factors linked to preserved cognitive function in the presence of AD pathology. Tracking compositional differences across the spectrum of AD pathology and cognitive impairment, we were able to pinpoint selectively vulnerable somatostatin inhibitory neuron subtypes depleted in AD, identify two distinct groups of inhibitory neurons that were more abundant in individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life, and uncover a link between inhibitory neurons and resilience to AD pathology.

Systematic differential expression analysis revealed widespread gene expression changes linked to various measures of AD pathology across many cell types. Some of these changes, including the increased expression of genes involved in synaptic signaling, may represent an attempt of cells to reestablish homeostasis. Other alterations, including the decreased expression of electron transport chain genes and genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, may contribute to cellular dysfunction in AD. Reduced expression of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB) might compromise the architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane and consequently contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD 53 .

Greater expression of the cohesin complex in AD was another phenomenon recurrently observed across multiple cell types. In agreement with a well-established link between DNA damage and neurodegenerative diseases 54 - 56 , we found that greater cohesin complex expression was accompanied by higher expression of DNA damage response factors. Especially in excitatory neurons, the cohesin complex expression was also correlated with the expression of many chromatin regulators, warranting the examination of changes to the chromatin landscape in AD (see the accompanying studies by Dileep et al. 48 and Xiong et al. 49 ). The cohesin complex has also been reported to prevent the end joining of distant DNA double-strand ends, thereby protecting against chromosomal re-arrangements 57 . In the accompanying manuscript, Dileep et al. 48 directly tested the prediction that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) will impact both linear and the 3D genome organization in neurodegeneration. Indeed, Dileep et al. 48 found that excitatory neurons in AD are enriched for gene fusions indicating chromosomal structural variations and that neuronal DNA double-strand breaks lead to mosaic chromosomal structural variations and 3D genome disruption in neurodegeneration.

We capitalized on the phenotypic variability between study participants in terms of cognitive function and cognitive decline to interrogate what characterizes individuals who maintain high cognitive function late in life. We identified genes positively associated with global cognitive function across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes, including the synaptic genes CACNG3, PAK1, NPTX2, RPH3A, SVOP, and BDNF. Another synaptic gene positively associated with global cognitive function was VGF, which is potently upregulated by BDNF 58 , and has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque burden, disease-associated microglial activation, and memory impairment in a mouse model of AD 59 . We found multiple genes involved in FGF signaling, including FGF1 and FGF22, that were positively associated with global cognitive function across multiple excitatory neuron subtypes. Interestingly, cerebrospinal fluid of young mice has recently been shown to restore memory in aged mice via Fgf17 60 . Whether other members of the fibroblast growth factor family might have similar rejuvenating power remains to be investigated.

Cell death is a defining feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. We analyzed how the composition of cell types changes as AD pathology advances to pinpoint especially vulnerable or resilient cell types. We identified a significant decrease in the relative abundance of somatostatin inhibitory neurons in individuals with high AD pathology, consistent with previous reports 61 - 63 . Going beyond the subclass level of inhibitory neurons, we identified a subset of three vulnerable somatostatin inhibitory neuron subtypes with transcriptomically similar identities significantly depleted in AD.

There is a 2.5-fold elevation in inhibitory neurons and an expanded inhibitory-to-inhibitory neuron network in humans compared with mice, highlighting the importance of this cell class for human brain function 64 - 66 . We tracked how the composition of cell types changes with the progression of cognitive impairment to pinpoint cell types linked to cognitive function in the aged human brain. We discovered two distinct groups of inhibitory neurons, including the vulnerable SST subtypes, that were more abundant in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life. The second group of inhibitory neurons linked to cognitive function centered around a RELN-positive subtype of the LAMP5 subclass. Consistent with our findings, loss of LAMP5 interneurons has recently been reported to drive neuronal network dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models 67 . Importantly, we found that the two groups of inhibitory neuron subtypes associated with cognition were also more abundant in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with high cognitive resilience to AD pathology. In summary, our results highlight a link between inhibitory neurons and preserved cognitive function late in life. The importance of inhibitory neurons in the context of preserved high cognitive function is well in line with a large body of literature describing a crucial role of this cell class in controlling brain oscillations, which are hypothesized to enhance information processing 68 , 69 . Recent technological advancements in neuroscience, in particular non-invasive ways of brain stimulation, will help elucidate the function of inhibitory neurons in preserving high cognitive performance late in life.

Our work provides a comprehensive resource for the medical, scientific, and pharmaceutical communities that offers a detailed molecular and cell-type-specific portrait of Alzheimer’s disease.

Despite a vast array of cells analyzed in this study, the limited number of cells acquired from each participant may impede certain analyses, particularly for less prevalent cell types. A simulation-based power analysis revealed considerably lower statistical power estimates for less abundant cell types such as those associated with the vasculature and inhibitory neuron subtypes ( Methods S1 , page 6A ). And our empirical investigation revealed a positive association between the number of cells evaluated per participant and the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified ( Methods S1 , page 6B and 6C ). This correlation indicates that the present study might have underestimated the number of DEGs in cell types with lower abundance, such as inhibitory neuron subtypes.

An additional important caveat to consider is the potential impact of ambient RNA contamination. To address this issue, we employed the DecontX method to estimate and remove ambient RNA from our snRNA-seq data. Overall, we found that the results of our original analysis were largely confirmed after removing ambient RNA contamination ( Data S1 , page 4F ). However, it's worth noting that certain glial cell types (Oli, OPC, Mic) showed a lower confirmation rate for downregulated genes after ambient RNA correction, suggesting the importance of considering this factor in their analysis.

It is also important to acknowledge certain limitations and complexities involved in analyzing data from a large number of individual human samples. One limitation is that gene expression variation can be influenced by multiple biological, demographic, and technical factors. To address this concern, we performed a comprehensive variance partitioning analysis, evaluating the contribution of known technical covariates and factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUV-seq to the gene expression variance in our dataset. We found that the factors estimated by RUV-seq effectively captured the variance attributable to known technical covariates ( Methods S1 , page 7 ). While this analysis strengthens the study's robustness, it is important to note that the influence of unmeasured or unknown covariates remains a potential limitation in our analysis. Nevertheless, we believe our approach provides a solid foundation for interpreting the data and enhances the reliability of our findings.

## EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
We selected 427 individuals from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), both ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia, in which all participants are brain donors. The studies include clinical data collected annually, detailed post-mortem pathological evaluations, and extensive genetic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic bulk-tissue profiling 70 . Individuals were balanced between sexes (male:female ratio 212:215). Among 427 study participants, 425 identified as White, and 2 identified as African-American. To the question, "Are you of Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin?", 423 participants answered "No," while 4 participants answered "Yes." Socioeconomic status of the participants was not determined for this study. Informed consent was obtained from each subject, and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project were each approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rush University Medical Center. Participants also signed an Anatomic Gift Act, and a repository consent to allow their data to be repurposed.

## METHOD DETAILS
A global measure of cognition was based on the average z-score of 17 cognitive performance tests proximate to death using the mean and SD from the baseline of all participants. Subsets of these tests were averaged to yield individual measures of episodic memory, perceptual orientation, perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory. Medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and stroke are documented. Motor function and gait are assessed. Cognitive, physical, and social life-style variables are documented ( Figure 2A ). Methods for these variables have been previously reported 20 , 71 - 81 .

For categorical analyses comparing individuals with and without pathologic AD, the cohort was dichotomized based on the modified NIA-Reagan diagnosis of AD which reflects a combination of Braak Score and CERAD AD, with 238 individuals having AD and 189 individuals without. A global burden of AD was based on standardized counts of neuritic and diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Other pathologies included Lewy bodis, TDP-43 pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular pathologies, i.e., macro- and microscopic infarcts, athero- and arteriolar-sclerosis, amyloid angiopathy. Methods for these pathologies have been previously reported 20 , 52 , 71 - 74 , 82 , 83 .

To quantify cognitive resilience, we computed a cognitive resilience score (CR score) as the difference between the observed cognition and the cognition predicted by a linear regression model, given the level of pathology ( Methods S1 , page 5A and 5B ). Using this approach, we computed Cognitive Resilience (CR) scores based on the measure of global cognitive function and Cognitive Decline Resilience (CDR) scores based on the measure estimating the rate of change of global cognitive function over time ( Methods S1 , page 5A and 5B ). Four distinct CR and CDR scores were derived based on four distinct measures of AD pathology, namely global AD pathology, and separately neuritic plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle burden, and tangle density.

The protocol for the isolation of nuclei from frozen post-mortem brain tissue was adapted from a previous study 23 . All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. In brief, post-mortem brain tissue was homogenized in 700 μl homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 U μl −1 recombinant RNase inhibitor (Clontech)) using a Wheaton Dounce tissue grinder (15 strokes with the loose pestle). Then the homogenized tissue was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer, mixed with an equal volume of working solution (50% OptiPrep density gradient medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded on top of an OptiPrep density gradient (750 μl 30% OptiPrep solution (30% OptiPrep density gradient medium,134 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.17 U μl −1 recombinant RNase inhibitor) on top of 300 μl 40% OptiPrep solution (40% OptiPrep density gradient medium, 96 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM Mg(CH 3 COO) 2 , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.12 U μl −1 recombinant RNase inhibitor). The nuclei were separated by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 g, 4 °C). A total of 100 μl of nuclei was collected from the 30%/40% interphase and washed with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.04% BSA. The nuclei were centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min (4 °C) and washed with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Then the nuclei were centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min (4 °C) and resuspended in 100 μl PBS containing 0.04% BSA. The nuclei were counted and diluted to a concentration of 1,000 nuclei per microliter in PBS containing 0.04% BSA.

For droplet-based snRNA-seq, libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). The generated snRNA-seq libraries were sequenced using NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kits (150 cycles) or NovaSeq 6000 S2 Reagent Kits.

Post-mortem brain tissue was homogenized in RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen, 74134) and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, 74134) according to manufacturer’s instruction. The RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, 170–8891). For gene expression analysis cDNA was quantitatively amplified on a thermal cycler (BioRad) using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad, 1725202) and gene-specific primers (HES4 forward, CCACTCGAAGCTGGAGAAGG; HES4 reverse, CGGCCGTCACCTGCAC; PDE10A forward, GACTCCTTGGGTTTTCCGGG; PDE10A reverse, TGAGGAAACACTCGGTCAGC; ST6GAL2 forward, TGCGCATTCCTGCATTCCTG; ST6GAL2 reverse, AATGCAGATGGGTGGCAGAA; GAD2 forward, GTCTGCCTCGCATCCTCACG; GAD2 reverse TTAGGGACGTGGCAACCCTT; LAMP5 forward, TTTGTGGTGCGGGAAAATGG; LAMP5 reverse, ATGCGATATCGGCCTGTTCT; SST forward, GCCGCTTTAGGAGCGAGGTT; SST reverse, AACTGACGGAGTCTGGGGTC; RPL13 forward, CGGCATTCACAAGAAGGGAGA; RPL13 reverse, TACGGAGACTAGCGAAGGCT). The comparative Ct method was used to examine differences in gene expression and values were normalized to expression levels of RPL13.

Fresh frozen human brain tissue (prefrontal cortex) of approximately 0.1 cm 3 in volume was immersed in 50 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) in 1X PBS (phosphate buffered saline) for 36 hours at 4 °C on a shaker before being embedded into 3% low melting point agarose. The embedded brain tissue was then sectioned at 30 μm using a vibratome (Leica). To retrieve the antigens, sections were incubated at 95 °C in immunohistochemistry (IHC) antigen retrieval solution (ThermoFisher Scientific; 00-4955-58) containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 45 min and then placed in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS (3 × 10 min), the brain sections were incubated in quenching solution (50 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM CUSO 4 ) at room temperature overnight. After washing with 1X PBS (3 × 15 min), the sections were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum at room temperature for 1 h. The sections were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in primary antibody in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum. Primary antibodies were anti-VGF antibody (1:200; Abcam; ab69989), anti-NPTX2 antibody (1:200; Abcam; ab69858), and anti-Somatostatin antibody (1:200, Abcam, ab108456). The sections were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature (4 × 15 min), and then incubated with secondary antibodies (dilution 1:2,000) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were visualized with Alexa-Fluor 488, Alexa-Fluor 594, and Alexa-Fluor 647 antibodies (Molecular Probes), and cell nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich; 94403). The sections were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature (4 × 15 min) and then mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus microscope slides in fluromount-G (Electron microscopic Sciences). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM 880; Zeiss) with a 20X objective. Z stack images were taken with a step size of 0.15-0.3 mm, averaging of 2, resolution 2048x2048 suitable for 3D reconstruction. Imarisx64 8.3.1 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) software was used for 3-D rendering and quantification of fluorescence images.

Frozen brain tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (VWR; 25608-930), cryo-sectioned to 20-μm thickness, and placed onto Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus microscope slides (ThermoFisher Scientific; 12-550-15). The RNAscope 2.5 HD Duplex Detection Kit (Chromogenic) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with minor modifications to tissue preparation. In brief, sections frozen at −80 °C were fixed in 4% PFA for 12 hours at 4 °C. Following fixation, the tissue was dehydrated using 50%, 70%, and 100% ethanol and then baked at 60 °C for 30 min to avoid detachment. The tissue was then treated with H 2 O 2 for 10 min at room temperature, followed by protease IV for 30 min. Brain sections were hybridized with the following RNAscope probes: GAD2 (RNAscope ® Probe - HS-GAD2-C2; ACD; 415621-C2), SST (RNAscope ® Probe - Hs-SST; ACD; 310591), LAMP5 (RNAscope ® Probe - HS-LAMP5-C2; ACD; 487691-C2), NPTX2 (RNAscope ® Probe - HS-NPTX2-C2; ACD; 464831-C2). Probes in channel 1 were labeled with HRP enzyme and visualized with a green/cyan substrate, and probes in channel 2 were labeled with alkaline phosphatase enzyme and a red substrate. Haematoxylin was used to mark cell nuclei in blue. Slides were then imaged using a confocal microscope (LSM 900; Zeiss) to take 10X and 20X bright-field images, with four images acquired per individual. For quantifying the number of nuclei and the number of GAD2-positive cells, the ‘analyze particles’ function in ImageJ 1.42q was used. For quantifying the number of SST-positive and LAMP5-positive cells, a researcher manually counted the cells labeled with green/cyan (SST) or red (LAMP5) substrate, respectively.

Post-mortem brain tissue was homogenized in 2 ml NF1 buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 U μl-1 recombinant RNase inhibitor (Clontech)) using a Wheaton Dounce tissue grinder (15 strokes with the loose pestle). After homogenization, an additional 8 ml of NF1 buffer was added and the samples were inverted 10 times to mix. The homogenate was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer (VWR; 21008-949) and centrifuged at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore Sigma; MAB377X) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 15 min at 4 °C on a shaker. The nuclei were washed by adding 35 ml PBS containing 1% BSA, spun down at 300g for 3 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS containing 0.04% BSA and 0.4 U μl-1 recombinant RNase inhibitor (Clontech), and stained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific; R37605). NeuN-positive nuclei were then directly sorted into RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen, 74134) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen; 74134) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad; 170-8891). For gene-expression analysis, cDNA was quantitatively amplified on a thermal cycler (BioRad) using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad; 1725202) and gene-specific primers ( Table S1 ).

Tissue blocks from prefrontal cortex were cryosection at 12um thickness on the cryostat (Leica CM3050S). Sections were directly mounted on Superfrost Plus Slides (Fisherbrand; Cat#12-550-15) and allowed to dry at −20 Celsius for 1 to 2 hours. Tissue was then processed following the recommended protocol by ACD Biotechne RNAscope assays. To quench autofluorescence, we applied TrueBlack (Biotium; Cat#23007) for 90 seconds after the final step (DAPI application) of the RNAscope assay procedure, and gently rinsed with PBS prior to coverslipping and imaging. For HiPlex multiplexing, we reapplied DAPI and TrueBlack at the end of every round. 2x2 tile scans with 12z steps were acquired with a confocal microscope (LSM 900; Zeiss) with 63× oil immersion objective. Maximum projection images were manually aligned on Photoshop (Adobe Photoshop 2021) with DAPI nuclei stain and tissue boundaries serving as guides for registration. Excitatory neurons were then identified based on probe detection for SLC17A7 (VGLUT1), while inhibitory cells were labeled with the inhibitory marker GAD2. After manually assigning neuronal identity as excitatory or inhibitory (greater than 7 dots). Manual curation of images was performed to ensure accurate probe detection by an investigator blind to the sample group.

## QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Gene counts were obtained by aligning reads to the GRCh38 genome using Cell Ranger software (v.3.0.2) (10x Genomics) 84 . To account for unspliced nuclear transcripts, reads mapping to pre-mRNA were counted. After quantification of pre-mRNA using the Cell Ranger count pipeline, the Cell Ranger aggr pipeline was used to aggregate all libraries (without equalizing the read depth between groups) to generate a gene-count matrix. The Cell Ranger 3.0 default parameters were used to call cell barcodes. We used SCANPY 85 to process and cluster the expression profiles and infer cell identities of major cell classes. To remove doublets and poor-quality cells, cells were excluded from subsequent analysis if they were extreme outliers (observations outside the range [Q1 – k(Q3 – Q1),Q3 + k(Q3-Q1)], with k=3 and Q1 and Q3 as the lower and upper quartiles) in terms of number of genes, number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and percentage of mitochondrial genes. In addition, we called doublets using Scrublet 86 and flagged and removed cells that were labeled as doublets, leaving a final dataset of 2,359,994 cells.

For the UMAP visualization of individual major cell type classes (excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, immune cells), the SCTransform-based integration workflow of Seurat 87 , 88 was used to align data from individual batches, using default settings. We selected the set of relevant principal components based on Elbow plots. High resolution cell clusters were identified using the Seurat functions FindNeighbors and FindClusters (using the Leiden clustering algorithm).

We annotated cell types using previously published marker genes and single-cell RNA-sequencing data 21 , 23 , 89 - 93 . To annotate cell types based on previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing data (Allen Institute’s cell types database; https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/human-multiple-cortical-areas-smart-seq ), we used three separate approaches. First, Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the average expression profiles of neuronal subpopulations previously defined by the Allen Brain Institute 21 and the neuronal subtypes identified in this study were computed using the cor function in R. Second, to project annotations of neuronal subpopulations previously defined by the Allen Brain Institute onto the neuronal cells analyzed in this study, we followed the integration and label transfer workflow of Seurat 88 . Third, we determined cell type marker genes based on data published by the Allen Brain Institute 21 using the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing; adjusted P < 0.05) and computed module scores for each cell type marker gene set across all neuronal cells analyzed in this study using the AddModuleScore function of Seurat. To further annotate cell types, we determined marker genes using the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing; adjusted P < 0.05). We tested only genes that were detected in a minimum of 25% of the cells within the cell type (min.pct = 0.25) and that showed, on average, at least a 0.25-fold difference (log-scale) between the cells of the cell type and all remaining cells (logfc.threshold = 0.25). Marker genes of the high-resolution cell types or states were determined separately for each major cell type class.

We performed differential expression analyses using the R package muscat 94 . Lowly expressed genes were excluded and only genes with more than one count in at least 10 cells were considered. To take advantage of robust bulk RNA-sequencing differential expression frameworks, such as edgeR 95 , in a first step muscat aggregates measurements for each sample (in each cluster) to obtain pseudobulk data. Using this approach single-cell measurements were aggregated per study participant and cell type using the sum of raw counts option. Differential expression analysis was run using the edgeR method as implemented in muscat. For the analysis of variables measuring AD pathology, cognition, or cognitive resilience, we included as covariates the individual’s age at death and post-mortem interval. For the analysis of measures of Lewy body and TDP-43 pathology, vascular pathology (macro- and microscopic infarcts, athero- and arteriolar-sclerosis, amyloid angiopathy), medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, stroke), motor function and gait, and life-style variables, we were interested in identifying gene expression alterations that are specifically linked to the measures mentioned and not associated with AD pathology. Therefore, for the analysis of these measures we included global AD pathology, age at death, and the post-mortem interval as covariates in the differential expression analysis. We report adjusted p-values for multiple testing in all cases by using the p.adjust function with the BH method as implemented in muscat. The multiple testing correction was performed locally, i.e., on each of the cell types separately with the number of tests equal to the number of genes considered. We provide differential expression results for each of the 54 high resolution cell types, as well as for astrocytes and microglia. Differential expression analyses were performed on the entire cohort unless stated otherwise (e.g., when analyzing gene expression changes across multiple stages of Alzheimer's disease progression). We also tested whether the observed associations between gene expression and global AD pathology remain significant after accounting for additional potential confounding factors such as technical variability and sex. For this analysis we included as covariates the individual’s age at death, post-mortem interval, sex, and factors of unwanted variation as determined by the R package RUVseq 96 . The factors of unwanted variation were determined using the RUVr function with the argument k set to 10 factors of unwanted variation. Moreover, we employed DecontX 26 to estimate and remove ambient RNA from our snRNA-seq data. Subsequently, the differential expression analysis was carried out using muscat, utilizing the decontaminated counts as input. In this analysis, we included the individual’s age at death, post-mortem interval, sex, and factors of unwanted variation determined by RUVseq as covariates, as described above.

For the group-based differential expression analysis, we categorized individuals into four distinct groups based on categorical variables assessing Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive impairment. Initially, we divided the individuals into two groups based on their pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (variable niareagansc). Within each of these two groups, we further selected individuals without cognitive impairment (final consensus cognitive diagnosis (cogdx) value of 1) and individuals with a cognitive diagnosis of AD dementia (cogdx value of 4). The following group comparisons were performed:

1) Group 3 (Pathologic diagnosis of AD and No cognitive impairment) versus Group 1 (No pathologic diagnosis of AD and No cognitive impairment)

2) Group 4 (Pathologic diagnosis of AD and Cognitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia) versus Group 2 (No pathologic diagnosis of AD/Cognitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia)

3) Group 4 (Pathologic diagnosis of AD and Cognitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia) versus Group 1 (No pathologic diagnosis of AD and No cognitive impairment)

For the differential expression analysis, we utilized muscat after removing ambient RNA from our snRNA-seq data using DecontX. As covariates, we included the individual's age at death, post-mortem interval, sex, and factors of unwanted variation determined by RUVseq, as described above.

To estimate the power of our dataset in detecting changes in gene expression, we performed a simulation-based power analysis using the R package RnaSeqSampleSize 97 . This package employs the average read count and dispersion distributions derived from real data to estimate the likelihood of detecting statistical significance in the dataset (power estimation). For this analysis, we utilized individual-level aggregated cell type-specific count matrices, which were used for the subsequent differential expression analysis in this study. We employed the “est_power_distribution” function of the RnaSeqSampleSize package, specifying the following parameters: the number of samples in each group (n=213), the minimal fold change between the two groups (rho=1.25), the false discovery rate (f=0.01), and the number of genes used in estimation of read counts and dispersion distribution (repNumber=100).

To determine the set of covariates to be included in the differential expression analysis, we performed a variance partitioning analysis. This analysis enabled us to identify the covariates that substantially contribute to the expression variance and, consequently, are expected to have an impact on the results of the differential expression analysis. The variance partitioning analysis was used to estimate the fraction of expression variance attributable to known (technical) sources of variation and factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUVseq. The known sources of variation evaluated were: average total transcript (UMI) count per cell (nUMI), average total gene count per cell (nGenes), average fraction of mitochondrial RNA (percent mito), average fraction of ribosomal RNA (percent ribo), number of cells (nCells), number of reads (nReads), and fraction of reads mapped to the genome (mapped Reads).

The variance partitioning analysis was performed using the function “fitVarPart” from the R package dreamlet (DiseaseNeurogenomics.github.io/dreamlet) 98 . The median fraction of variance across genes attributed to each covariate was determined and the total fraction of variance attributed to a set of covariates was determined as the sum of the median variance attributed to each individual covariate of the set. The analysis included twenty sets of covariates, each progressively incorporating one additional covariate, with the purpose of evaluating whether the addition of a covariate increases the total fraction of variance explained. The 20 sets of covariates evaluated in the variance partitioning analysis were as follows:

1) pmi,

2) pmi+age,

3) pmi+age+sex,

4) pmi+age+sex+w_1,

5) pmi+age+sex+w_1+w_2,

The variables w_1 to w_10 represent the factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUVseq. The analysis was performed separately for each major cell type.

As an alternative approach to assess the extent to which the factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUVseq capture the known sources of variation, we conducted a correlation analysis between the two sets of variables. Specifically, we evaluated the correlation between the known sources of variation and the factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUVseq using the cor.test function in R, with the argument “alternative” set to “two.sided” and the argument “method” set to “spearman”.

Statistical significance of the overlap of DEGs between cell types and variables was computed using Fisher’s exact test using the R package GeneOverlap (v1.28.0) ( http://shenlab-sinai.github.io/shenlab-sinai/ ) 99 . The background (argument genome.size) for the gene overlap analysis comparing different variables was defined as the total number of genes evaluated in the differential expression analysis in the cell type under examination. Conversely, when comparing between cell types, the background (argument genome.size) was defined as the union of genes subjected to the differential expression analysis in the two cell types of interest. The P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni method. Circos plots illustrating the overlap of DEGs between cell types were generated using the circlize package in R. Venn diagrams illustrating the overlap of DEGs between variables were created using the R package ggVennDiagram.

Genes were categorized into 10 subsets based on their average expression level in excitatory neurons. Then the overlap of global AD pathology-associated DEGs between excitatory neuron cell types was evaluated within each subset. The average expression level of genes was determined using the “AverageExpression” function in the Seurat R package. Statistical significance of the overlap of DEGs between cell types was computed using Fisher’s exact test using the R package GeneOverlap (v1.28.0) ( http://shenlab-sinai.github.io/shenlab-sinai/ ) 99 . The P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni method.

The average expression of each gene in each excitatory neuron subtype was determined using the 'AverageExpression' function from the Seurat R package. The genes considered in the differential expression analysis for each excitatory neuron subtype were categorized into 10 subsets based on their average expression level within the corresponding subtype. Next, the genes in each of the 10 subsets were intersected with the genes identified to be significantly associated with global AD pathology. This intersection allowed us to determine the number of significant DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) in each subset. The process was performed separately for genes positively and negatively associated with global AD pathology. Subsequently, we randomly sampled the determined number of significant DEGs from each of the 10 subsets, ensuring that the expression level distribution of the DEGs was preserved in the random samples. This random sampling step was repeated for a total of 1000 iterations. For each of the 1000 random samples, we determined the overlap of genes between excitatory neuron subtypes and compared it to the observed overlap between the two cell types. To assess the significance of the observed overlap, we computed z scores, which represent the difference between the observed value of overlap and the mean value of overlap based on the permutation results, divided by the standard deviation of the permutation results.

The permutation test to assess the significance of the overlap of differentially expressed genes between our dataset and the De Jager dataset was conducted similarly as described above. Briefly, we computed the average expression level of each gene within each cell type and categorized the genes considered in the differential expression analysis into 10 subsets based on their average expression level. Subsequently, we determined the number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within each subset and randomly sampled the same number of DEGs, preserving the expression level distribution of DEGs, for a total of 1000 iterations. These steps were performed separately for both our dataset and the De Jager dataset.

To evaluate the impact of cell number on the detection of DEGs and the overlap of DEGs between cell types, we employed the following approach. For each excitatory neuron subtype, we downscaled the number of cells per individual using the “subset” function of the R package Seurat, specifying the desired number of cells with the “downsample” argument. Next, we performed differential expression analysis using the R package muscat, following the previously described methodology. To determine the statistical significance of the DEG overlap between cell types, we employed Fisher's exact test, utilizing the R package GeneOverlap (v1.28.0) ( http://shenlabsinai.github.io/shenlab-sinai/ ) 99 . The background, represented by the “genome.size” argument, was defined as the union of genes subjected to the differential expression analysis in the two cell types of interest. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we adjusted the p-values using the Bonferroni method.

Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed using metascape 100 ( http://metascape.org ). For all cases we used the complete proteome as the default background in Metascape and report multi-test corrected q-values.

Consensus signatures were defined as sets of genes significantly associated with global AD pathology in at least three different excitatory neuron subtypes. Consensus signatures were defined for genes positively and negatively associated with global AD pathology, respectively. The synaptic location of consensus signature genes was examined using the curated ontology of the SynGO consortium 30 . SynGO analyses were performed via the SynGO portal ( https://www.syngoportal.org/ ) using default settings.

To test the robustness and generalizability of our results, we divided the full cohort into two non-overlapping random subsets and performed the differential expression analysis separately on both sub-cohorts. The differential expression analyses was performed using the R package muscat 94 . Lowly expressed genes were excluded and only genes with more than one count in at least 10 cells were considered. For the analysis of the variable measuring global AD pathology, we included as covariates the individual’s age at death, post-mortem interval, sex, and factors of unwanted variation as determined by the R package RUVseq 96 . The factors of unwanted variation were determined using the RUVr function with the argument k set to 10 factors of unwanted variation. The multiple testing correction was performed locally using the p.adjust function with the BH method as implemented in muscat. Statistical significance of the overlap of DEGs between the results of the original analysis across the entire cohort and the two random sub-cohorts was computed using Fisher’s exact test using the R package GeneOverlap”. The P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni method. The correlation of association scores and effect sizes (log fold change) was computed using the cor.test function in R with the argument “method” set to "spearman". For the correlation analysis significant DEGs as determined by the original differential expression analysis across the entire cohort were considered.

The correlation of the effect size of up- and downregulated genes between multiple AD pathology-related variables including global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle burden, tangle density, overall amyloid level, and diffuse plaque burden was computed using the cor.test function in R with the argument “method” set to "pearson". The union of genes significantly associated with the two variables of interest were considered, and the correlation was computed based on the log fold change values. The analysis was performed separately for positively and negatively associated genes.

To validate our differential expression results, we conducted a comparison with multiple previously published single-nucleus RNA sequencing studies of Alzheimer's disease 15 , 16 , 24 , 25 . The results of differential expression analyses from the studies conducted by Lau et al., Morabito et al., Sadick et al., and Su et al. were obtained by retrieving the supplementary information associated with each respective study. We evaluated the correlation between the effect sizes of genes associated with global Alzheimer's disease pathology in our study and the effect sizes of overlapping DEGs in the previously published studies. The correlation was computed using the cor.test function in R with the argument “alternative” set to “two.sided" and the argument “method” set to "pearson". P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the BH method as implemented in the R function p.adjust. Association scores were determined by multiplying the correlation coefficient by the negative log10 of the BH-adjusted P value and dividing the product by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient. Thus, the association score was defined as the signed negative log10 BH-adjusted P value, where the sign was derived from the sign of the correlation coefficient.

First, we computed the average expression per study participant for each gene in each cell type. Then, for each cell type, a gene-wise correlation coefficient (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) was computed using gene expression and selected traits across all individuals as variables. The traits included in this analysis were apoe_genotype (ApoeE genotype), cogdx (final cognitive consensus diagnosis), cogdx_stroke (Clinical diagnosis of stroke), dxpark (Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease), cogn_global_lv (Global cognitive function), cogn_ep_lv (Episodic memory), cogn_po_lv (Perceptual orientation), cogn_ps_lv (Perceptual speed), cogn_se_lv (Semantic memory), cogn_wo_lv (Working memory), cognep_random_slope (rate of change of episodic memory), cogng_random_slope (rate of change of global cognitive function), cognpo_random_slope (rate of change of perceptual orientation), cognps_random_slope (rate of change of perceptual speed), cognse_random_slope (rate of change of semantic memory), cognwo_random_slope (rate of change of working memory), age_death (age at death), msex (Sex), hypertension_bl (Hypertension), cancer_bl (Cancer at baseline), diabetes_sr_rx_bl (Diabetes), headinjrloc_bl (Head injury), heart_bl (Heart), stroke_bl (Stroke), bradysc_lv (Bradykinesia score), gaitsc_lv (Gait score), parksc_lv (Parkinsonian summary score), braaksc (Braak stage), ceradsc (CERAD score), gpath (Global AD pathology), gpath_3neocort (global measure of neocortical AD pathology), niareagansc (NIA-Reagan diagnosis of AD), plaq_d_mf (Diffuse plaque burden in the midfrontal cortex), pmi (post-mortem interval), amyloid (overall amyloid level), plaq_d (Diffuse plaque burden), plaq_n (Neuritic plaque burden), plaq_n_mf (Neuritic plaque burden in the midfrontal cortex), dlbdx (Lewy Body disease), nft (Neurofibrillary tangle burden), nft_mf (Neurofibrillary tangle burden in the midfrontal cortex), tangles (Tangle density), tdp_st4 (TDP-43 stage), arteriol_scler (Arteriolosclerosis), caa_4gp (Cerebral amyloid angiopathy), cvda_4gp2 (Cerebral atherosclerosis), ci_num2_gct (Gross chronic infarcts), ci_num2_mct (Chronic microinfarcts), ci_num2_gtt (Gross infarcts), ci_num2_mtt (Microinfarcts), gpath_CR_score (Global AD pathology cognitive resilience score), age_death_CR_score (Age at death cognitive resilience score). The resulting correlation matrices for each cell type were concatenated and analysed using a computational algorithm (SOM) 101 . All SOMs were created using the kohonen R package 102 .

Using the CORUM database, a comprehensive resource of mammalian protein complexes 33 , 2417 identified core complexes in humans were subsetted out of 3512 complexes. A module score was computed for each complex in each cell by the AddModuleScore function from Seurat 103 - 106 . An averaged module score was assigned to each individual for each cell subtype in each brain region. This was followed by fitting a generalized linear model to the data to identify directionality of the module scores in each cell subtype and in each brain region relative to pathology and cognition variables. Age at death and post-mortem interval (pmi) were included as confounding variables with each predictor variable of interest in the model. The Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) method was used for adjusting the P values for multiple comparisons as implemented by the p.adjust function from the R stats package (each heatmap comprises adjusted p-values for the shown comparisons or more comparisons that were not shown). Association scores were computed by multiplying the sign of the regression coefficient by the negative log10 P value (signed negative log10 P value) for each comparison. Following the same approach, we also computed the association between the expression level of protein complexes and Lewy body pathology, TDP-43 pathology, vascular pathology, and other medical conditions.

To increase the stringency of our selection, we tested whether genes encoding protein complex components of complexes significantly associated with AD pathology, were also detected as significantly differentially expressed genes. For each protein complex and each cell type, we determined the fraction of complex components that were identified as significantly differentially expressed. Based on this analysis we selected 14 protein complexes that were prominently associated with pathology at the complex level and at the single gene level.

To determine which protein complexes exhibit a conserved alteration in response to global pathology in excitatory neurons, averaged regression coefficient and aggregated p-value were computed for each complex across 12 cell subtypes. Aggregated p-value was derived using sumlog function from metap package 107 , which combine p-values by the sum of logs method (Fisher's method). Averaged regression coefficients and negative log10 of aggregated p-values for all complexes were plotted using a volcano plot (n=2338). In addition to Fisher's exact test, we employed the Cauchy combination test to address potential violations of the independence assumption and correlated p-values 108 . P-values were combined using the CCT function of the R package STAAR, which aggregates p-values using the Cauchy method 109 , 110 . Our analysis using the Cauchy combination test yielded consistent findings with those obtained from Fisher's exact test, confirming the upregulation of the Cohesin-SA1 complex as the most significant among the analyzed complexes.

To identify genes co-regulated with the cohesin complex, we determined the correlation between the expression level of each gene and the module score of the protein complex. The correlation between genes and complexes was determined across all the individual cells of a cell type. The Spearman correlation was computed using the rcorr function from the Harrell Miscellaneous (Hmisc) R package. P values were adjusted for multiple testing (the number of genes tested per cell type) using the BH method as implemented in the R function p.adjust. Association scores for each gene in each cell type were determined by multiplying the correlation coefficient by the negative log10 of the BH-adjusted P value and dividing the product by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient. Thus, the association score was defined as the signed negative log10 BH-adjusted P value, where the sign was derived from the sign of the correlation coefficient.

To identify genes co-regulated with the cohesin complex in excitatory neurons, we focused our analysis on genes significantly positively associated with global AD pathology in at least three excitatory neuron cell types (consensus signature genes). For each of these genes the vector of association scores across the 12 excitatory neuron subtypes was used to determine pairwise gene-gene Pearson correlation coefficients using the cor function in R. Finally, k-means clustering of the resulting gene-gene correlation matrix as implemented in the Heatmap function of the R package ComplexHeatmap 111 was used to identify sets of genes with a similar association with cohesin complex expression across excitatory neuron subtypes. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis of identified gene sets co-regulated with the cohesin complex was performed using metascape 100 .

To identify genes co-regulated with the cohesin complex in oligodendrocytes, gene-complex association scores for the cohesin-SA1, cohesin-SA2, and the IKBA-p50-p65 Nf(kappa)B complex in oligodendrocytes were determined as described above. For each gene, the vector of association scores across the three protein complexes was used for the downstream analysis. For the downstream analysis, only genes significantly positively associated with global AD pathology in oligodendrocytes were considered. Genes were grouped by k-means clustering of the vectors of association scores described above using the Heatmap function of the R package ComplexHeatmap 111 .

In addition to the analysis performed based on tissue from the prefrontal cortex, we analyzed the co-regulation between genes and the cohesin complex in the mid-temporal cortex, the angular gyrus, the entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. A module score was computed for each complex in each cell by the AddModuleScore function from Seurat 103 - 106 . To identify genes co-regulated with the cohesin complex, we determined the correlation between the expression level of each gene and the module score of the cohesin complex. The correlation between genes and complexes was determined across all the individual cells of a major cell type. The major cell types considered in this analysis were excitatory neurons (Exc), inhibitory neurons (Inh), astrocytes (Ast), oligodendrocytes (Oli), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and microglia (Mic). The Spearman correlation was computed using the cor.test function in R with the argument “alternative” set to "two.sided". P values were adjusted for multiple testing (the number of genes tested per cell type) using the BH method as implemented in the R function p.adjust. Association scores for each gene in each cell type were determined by multiplying the correlation coefficient by the negative log10 of the BH-adjusted P value and dividing the product by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.

We also clustered consensus signature genes positively associated with global AD pathology in excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex based on their correlation with the cohesin-SA1 or the cohesin-SA2 complex in the excitatory neurons of the four cortical brain regions mentioned above (mid-temporal cortex, angular gyrus, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus). For each gene the vector of association scores across excitatory neurons of the mid-temporal cortex, angular gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus was used to compute pairwise gene-gene Pearson correlation coefficients using the cor function in R. Finally, k-means clustering of the resulting gene-gene correlation matrix as implemented in the Heatmap function of the R package ComplexHeatmap 111 was used to identify sets of genes with a similar association with cohesin complex expression across excitatory neurons of four distinct brain regions.

Differential expression analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the ROSMAP cohorts was performed with DESeq2 112 (plotted) and edgeR 113 - 115 . Age at death and post-mortem interval (pmi) were converted into z-scores and included as confounding variables in the regression equation in the differential expression analysis with each variable of interest. Both approaches provided similar results.

To quantify cognitive resilience, linear regression analysis was used to model the relation between cognition and pathology (Prism 9, Version 9.3.1). For each individual, a score was calculated as the difference between the observed cognition (y) and the predicted cognition (y) by the model based on their level of pathology (x) ( Methods S1 , page 5A and 5B ). Cognitive Resilience (CR) was measured based on global cognitive function. On the other hand, to quantify the Cognitive Decline Resilience (CDR), the random slope of global cognition (the estimated person-specific rate of change in the global cognition variable over time) was used as the dependent variable in the model.

To study the resilience to AD pathology along disease progression, CR and CDR scores were derived based on four measures of AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden (plaq_n), neurofibrillary tangle burden (nft), tangle density (tangles) and global AD pathology (gpath). Each individual in the cohort was assigned 8 new measures of cognitive resilience, based on the available clinical-pathological measures. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using muscat 116 , correcting for the confounding variables age at death and post-mortem interval (pmi) to retrieve cell type-specific gene expression alterations associated with cognitive resilience. To confirm the differential gene expression results based on the CR and CDR scores, we also evaluated the association between gene expression and global cognitive function or the rate of change of global cognitive function adjusting for AD pathology as a covariate. The AD pathology measures considered as a covariate were global AD pathology (gpath), neuritic plaque burden (plaq_n), neurofibrillary tangle burden (nft), or tangle density (tangles). Thus, together with the DGE analysis based on CR and CDR scores, we performed a total of 16 different tests assessing the association between gene expression and cognitive resilience.

Differential expression analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the ROSMAP cohorts was performed with DESeq2 112 (plotted) and edgeR 113 - 115 . Both approaches provided similar results.

Overrepresentation analysis of resilience genes expressing cells was performed for each cell type and the following brain regions: prefrontal cortex, mid-temporal cortex, angular gyrus, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Individuals were split into high/low subgroups for each CR/CDR variable based on the median value determined using the quantile function with probability of 0.5 from the R stats package. The distribution function for the hypergeometric distribution (phyper in R) was used for computing the significance of the enrichment of cells detectably expressing the gene of interest in each cell subtype in the high CR/CDR subgroup. The phyper arguments were defined as, q: number of gene-expressing cells in the high subgroup, k: total number of cells in the high subgroup, n: number of gene-non-expressing cells in in both subgroups (total population), m: number of gene-expressing cells in both subgroups (total population) and lower.tail=FALSE to compute probabilities, P[X>x] , The Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) method was used for adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons as implemented in the p.adjust function from the R stats package (each heatmap comprises adjusted p-values for the shown comparisons or more comparisons that were not shown).

To determine cell types enriched for cells isolated from individuals with low AD pathology, high cognition, or high cognitive resilience to AD pathology, we first split the cohort into four quarters based on the quartiles of the variable of interest. Then, for each high-resolution cell type the overrepresentation of cells isolated from the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of individuals was computed separately using the hypergeometric cumulative distribution function (phyper() function) in R. The arguments for the phyper function were defined as, q: number of cells in the cell type of interest isolated from the quarter of individuals of interest minus 1, m: the total number of cells isolated from the quarter of individuals of interest, n: the total number of cells minus the total number of cells isolated from the quarter of individuals of interest, k: number of cells in the cell type of interest and lower.tail=FALSE to compute probabilities, P[X>x] . The P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni method with the number of tests equal to the product of all cell types and conditions analyzed (6954 tests).

For comparing the relative abundance of cell types between groups of individuals, the fraction of cells of a cell type was computed relative to all the cells isolated from an individual. To analyze changes in the relative abundance of cell types with disease progression, we first defined groups of individuals by splitting the cohort into four quarters based on the quartiles of the variable of interest. The statistical analysis of differences in the relative abundance of cell types between groups was performed using Kruskal-Wallis’s test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. For comparisons between two groups (e.g., high versus low cognitive resilience), the statistical analysis of differences in the relative abundance of cell types between the groups was performed using multiple Mann-Whitney tests and P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Holm-Šídák method. The statistical analyses comparing the relative abundance of cell types was performed using Prism 9 software.

We investigated the relationship between the relative abundance of cell types and measures of AD pathology, cognition, and cognitive resilience by modeling the number of cells of a certain cell type in a specific sample (individual study participant) relative to the total number of cells (in that sample) using a quasi-binomial regression model. We fitted the regression model using the glm function in R, including age, sex, and post-mortem interval as covariates. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure as implemented in the R function p.adjust. The results are presented in the form of association scores (signed negative log10 BH-adjusted P value, where the sign was determined by the direction (positive or negative) of the association). To compare individuals with and without cognitive impairment among subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, we selected individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD, and among those further selected individuals without cognitive impairment (final consensus cognitive diagnosis (cogdx) value of 1) and individuals with a cognitive diagnosis of AD dementia (cogdx value of 4). The cogdx variable was then transformed into a binary variable, where a cogdx score of 4 was assigned the value of 0, and a score of 1 was assigned the value of 1. Finally, the quasi-binomial regression analysis was performed as described above using the glm function in R with the argument "family" set to “quasibinomial”, and including age, sex, and post-mortem interval as covariates.

To validate our findings, we analyzed a separate large single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 465 ROSMAP study participants (referred to as the De Jager dataset) 27 , 117 . Processed snRNAseq data (DLPFC, Experiment 2) were obtained from Synapse ( https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51123521 ).

To further validate our findings with data from a different brain region, we downloaded a snRNA-seq dataset derived from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) 29 . Specifically, processed data (SEAAD_MTG_RNAseq_final-nuclei.2023-05-05.h5ad) were obtained from the Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) ( https://sea-ad-single-cell-profiling.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#MTG/RNAseq/ ). To project our cell type annotations onto the De Jager dataset and the SEA-AD dataset, we followed the reference mapping workflow of Seurat using the commands FindTransferAnchors and MapQuery. Differential gene expression analyses on these datasets were performed using muscat, as described above, after estimating and removing ambient RNA from the snRNA-seq data using DecontX. In these analyses, we included the individual’s age at death, post-mortem interval, sex, and factors of unwanted variation determined by RUVseq as covariates.

Imarisx64 8.1.2 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to analyze BDH1 expression levels within GFAP-positive astrocytes, and CHCHD6 expression levels within NEUN-positive neurons. The IMARIS surface functions was first applied to 3D render GFAP and NEUN signals in respective experiment, allowing to define regions of interest for further analyses. The "IMAIRSColoc" function was then utilized to create a new channel, referred to as the colocalized channel, from the 2 source channels. Following this, to quantify the volume of the colocalized signals, additional surfaces were produced specifically for the colocalized channel.

Figure S7. Cell types associated with cognitive resilience to AD pathology, related to Figure 7

(A, D, F, G) Relative abundance of (A) major cell types, (D) inhibitory neuron subclasses, (F) SST inhibitory neuron subtypes, or (G) inhibitory neuron subtypes (LAMP5 RELN group) comparing individuals with high-versus low cognitive resilience scores. Within each box, horizontal lines denote median values; boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile of each group's distribution of values; whiskers extend from the 5th to the 95th percentile. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05; ns, P > 0.05 (multiple Mann-Whitney tests corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Holm-Šídák method).

(B and E) Association (quasi-binomial regression) between the relative abundance of (B) inhibitory neurons or (E) SST inhibitory neurons and the clinical consensus diagnosis of cognitive status at the time of death (cogdx). Bar plot showing the regression coefficient for the predictor variable cogdx. Error bars represent the 95 % confidence interval. *P < 0.05 (glm function in R for quasi-binomial regression). Only individuals with a pathologic diagnosis of AD were considered in this analysis.

(C) Overrepresentation within each inhibitory neuron subtype of cells isolated from individuals with varying degrees of cognitive resilience (hypergeometric test; the P values have been adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing; **−log10(Bonferroni-corrected P values) are shown).
