APP substrate ectodomain defines amyloid‐β peptide length by restraining γ‐secretase processivity and facilitating product release

# Abstract
Sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ‐secretases generates amyloid‐β (Aβ) peptides and defines the proportion of short‐to‐long Aβ peptides, which is tightly connected to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we study the mechanism that controls substrate processing by γ‐secretases and Aβ peptide length. We found that polar interactions established by the APP C99 ectodomain (ECD), involving but not limited to its juxtamembrane region, restrain both the extent and degree of γ‐secretases processive cleavage by destabilizing enzyme–substrate interactions. We show that increasing hydrophobicity, via mutation or ligand binding, at APP C99 ‐ECD attenuates substrate‐driven product release and rescues the effects of Alzheimer's disease‐associated pathogenic γ‐secretase and APP variants on Aβ length. In addition, our study reveals that APP C99 ‐ECD facilitates the paradoxical production of longer Aβs caused by some γ‐secretase inhibitors, which act as high‐affinity competitors of the substrate. These findings assign a pivotal role to the substrate ECD in the sequential proteolysis by γ‐secretases and suggest it as a sweet spot for the potential design of APP‐targeting compounds selectively promoting its processing by these enzymes.

## Introduction
γ‐Secretases (GSECs) are multifaceted proteolytic switches controlling numerous signalling processes in pathophysiology (Jurisch‐Yaksi et al , 2013 ; Chávez‐Gutiérrez & Szaruga, 2020 ). They are multimeric, membrane‐embedded complexes that consist of nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1), presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN‐2), and presenilin (PSEN, catalytic subunit) (Hur, 2022 ). GSECs recognize type I membrane proteins presenting short (< 50 aa) ectodomains (Struhl & Adachi, 2000 ; Funamoto et al , 2013 ; Güner et al , 2020 ) and cleave them sequentially within their transmembrane domains (TMD) in a process referred to as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (Brown et al , 2000 ). An initial (endopeptidase) ε‐cleavage may switch on/off signalling cascades at the membrane by either releasing soluble courier proteins intracellularly or destroying membrane‐embedded signalling proteins. The release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane (Schroeter et al , 1998 ; De Strooper et al , 1999 ), a key event in the Notch‐signalling pathway, illustrates the former, while cleavage of the “pro‐apoptotic signalling” C‐terminal fragments of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75‐CTF) exemplifies the latter case (Franco et al , 2021 ).

Two structures of the initial enzyme–substrate (E‐S) complexes with either the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Fig 1A ) or Notch are available. Despite the low‐sequence similarity of these substrates, the structures show a remarkably similar overall E‐S conformation (Yang et al , 2019 ; Zhou et al , 2019 ), wherein PSEN embraces the (mainly) helical TMD of the substrate. Near the active site, PSEN and the substrate form a hybrid (E‐S) β‐sheet structure which exposes the scissile bond to the catalytic Asp dyad; thus, facilitating the ε‐cleavage and consequent release of the intracellular domain of the substrate. The remaining TMD stub is then sequentially cut (carboxypeptidase‐like γ‐cleavages), ultimately resulting in the release of an N‐terminal peptide (Fig 1B ).

The generation of N‐terminal amyloid‐β (Aβ) peptides from APP by GSECs plays a pivotal pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016 ), and therefore has been a matter of intense research. Removal of the APP ectodomain (ECD) by β‐secretase (BACE) generates a membrane‐embedded APP C‐terminal fragment of 99 amino acids (aa) in length (APP C99 ) (Vassar et al , 1999 ), which is then cleaved in a stepwise manner (processivity) by GSECs along two major product lines (Takami et al , 2009 ; Matsumura et al , 2014 ) (Fig 1B ).

Mutations in PSEN1/2 and APP causing familial AD (FAD) destabilize E‐S interactions (Szaruga et al , 2017 ) and thereby promote the release of partially digested, longer Aβ peptides such as Aβ42 (Szaruga et al , 2015 ), Aβ43 (Saito et al , 2011 ; Kretner et al , 2016 ; Veugelen et al , 2016 ), and possibly Aβ45 and Aβ46 (Liu et al , 2017 ). Pathogenic mutations consistently shift the Aβ product profile toward longer Aβ peptides (Szaruga et al , 2015 ), and the short‐to‐long Aβ(37 + 38 + 40)/(42 + 43) ratio linearly correlates with the age at clinical AD onset (AAO) in carriers of PSEN1 variants (Petit et al , 2022a ). The pathological relevance of shifts in the proportion of short‐to‐long Aβ peptides has also been demonstrated in the sporadic and most common form of AD (SAD) (Liu et al , 2022 ), where changes in the Aβ37/42 ratio distinguish AD patients from cognitively normal subjects. In both familial and sporadic AD, increments in longer Aβs (≥ 42 aa) are proposed to promote the assembly of (yet‐to‐be‐identified) toxic Aβ assemblies that initiate molecular and cellular cascades leading to neurodegeneration (Hardy & Higgins, 1992 ; Selkoe & Hardy, 2016 ).

Allosteric GSEC inhibitors (GSIs), such as DAPT (Qi‐Takahara et al , 2005 ; Yagishita et al , 2006 ) and semagacestat (Tagami et al , 2017 ), also lead to increases in the production of longer Aβ peptides, while partially inhibiting GSEC activity. This paradoxical “FAD‐mimicking” effect on Aβ production has been postulated to contribute to the worsening of cognition observed in AD patients treated with the GSI semagacestat (Tagami et al , 2017 ). The underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear.

Genetic and clinical observations thus assign high pathophysiological relevance to the sequential cleavage of APP by GSEC. Nevertheless, its molecular underpinnings are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms controlling the processive proteolysis of APP by GSECs that define Aβ product length. Our investigations show that the ECD of the substrate (APP C99 /Aβ) restricts processivity as well as markedly destabilizes E‐S interactions and pinpoint polar interactions involving but not limited to its juxtamembrane region as the critical underlying feature. We found that increased hydrophobicity in APP C99 ‐ECD, due to substitutions at key Lys28 and Asp23 positions, mitigates APP C99 ‐ECD‐driven destabilization and markedly promotes efficient and extended sequential proteolysis of Aβ. Notably, attenuation of this substrate‐driven product release mechanism rescues the effects of AD pathogenic variants in GSEC and APP on Aβ profiles.

Our analyses of GSEC‐mediated Notch cleavage indicate that this substrate‐driven mechanism is of general application. Collectively, these data support a model in which polar/charged residues in the membrane‐proximal region in the substrate ECD form an energy barrier that serves as a “pivot” in the product release mechanism, and suggest that stochastic overcoming of this barrier facilitates further threading of the substrate. Finally, data on the inhibition of GSEC by DAPT and semagacestat show that these inhibitors act as high‐affinity competitors to substrates and that the destabilizing nature of APP C99 ‐ECD facilitates the GSI's paradoxical effects on the production of longer Aβ peptides.

Our studies assign a pivotal role to the substrate's ECD in the sequential proteolysis of GSEC and suggest a potential sweet spot for the design of compounds selectively promoting efficient APP processing.

## Results
The efficiency of the sequential proteolysis of APP by GSECs plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and its modulation by small compounds is being pursued as a therapeutic strategy (Luo & Li, 2022 ). Previous studies have shown that mutations in the APP substrate modulate its processing by GSEC to promote the generation of shorter Aβ peptides. Most importantly, the literature highlights a remarkable link between Lys28 situated in the juxtamembrane region of APP C99 (Fig 1A , upper purple circle) and Aβ product length, with substitutions to Ala or Glu markedly shifting production towards the generation of very short Aβ34 and Aβ33 peptides (Page et al , 2010 ; Kukar et al , 2011 ; Ousson et al , 2013 ; Jung et al , 2014 ; Petit et al , 2019 ). These findings support the notion that intrinsic determinants in the substrate play a major role in defining enzyme processivity and thereby Aβ product length. To gain insights into the underlying mechanism(s), we fist mapped the sequence determinants in APP C99 ‐ECD that modulate the sequential γ‐cleavages by performing an alanine/phenylalanine (Ala/Phe) mutagenic scan of the Leu17‐Ile32 stretch (Fig 1C ). This region corresponds to the ECD of the shorter APP C83 substrate (generated by ADAM10), which contains all features required for efficient GSEC‐mediated proteolysis (Funamoto et al , 2013 ). We transiently expressed WT or mutant APP C99 in HEK293T cells and measured the levels of secreted Aβ37/38/40/42 peptides in the conditioned media (CM) by ELISA. We found that the K28A, K28F, D23F, and E22F mutations drastically lowered all measured peptides (Fig EV1A ), despite robust expression levels of WT/mutant substrates (Fig EV1B ). These peptides, from now on referred to as canonical Aβs, were also significantly decreased by the A21F‐, D23A‐, G25F, N27F, G29F‐, A30F‐, I31F‐, and I32F mutations (Fig EV1A ), and increased by the F20A substitution in APP C99 . The latter effect is consistent with previous findings showing that Phe20 is part of an inhibitory domain (Aβ17‐23) in APP/Aβ and that disruption of this domain elevates GSEC activity (Tian et al , 2010 ).

Aβ profiles, estimated as the percentage of each peptide relative to the total canonical Aβ levels, were analysed for all substrates, except the K28F and D23F mutants due to very low peptide levels. Aβ profiles revealed marked shifts towards enhanced generation of short Aβ37 and Aβ38 peptides for Phe substitutions at positions Ser26‐Ala30, while the analogous mutations to Ala displayed similar but milder effects (Figs 1D and EV1C ). In addition, Ala substitutions at positions Ala21‐Asp23 caused mild increments in Aβ38 (Fig 1D ).

To estimate the efficiency of the sequential processing, we determined the Aβ(37 + 38)/(40 + 42) ratio (Chávez‐Gutiérrez et al , 2012 ). The data revealed 6‐, 30‐, and 15‐fold increases in GSEC processivity for the mutant N27F‐, K28A‐, and G29F‐APP C99 substrates, respectively (Fig 1E ).

We next investigated the processing of mutant K28F and D23F substrates in a cell‐free GSEC activity assay, using purified enzyme and substrate. We found no significant differences in AICD product levels generated from WT, K28F, or D23F mutants, relative to the (reference) D23A, K28A, S26F, and N27A/F mutant APP C99 substrates (Fig EV1D ). These results imply that the lack of generation of canonical Aβ peptides resulted from mutation‐driven changes in processivity, rather than from changes in the overall substrate endopeptidase processing. To further investigate this, we immunoprecipitated (IPed) secreted Aβ peptides from CM and analysed them by MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometry. We included the E22F substrate in this analysis given its profound effects on canonical Aβ levels (Fig EV1A ). As expected, mass spectra showed Aβ40 as the major product generated from the WT substrate, and lower amounts of the Aβ33, Aβ37, Aβ38, Aβ39, and Aβ42 peptides. Treatment with the GSEC inhibitor L‐685,458 (InhX) completely abolished Aβ production (Fig EV1E ), demonstrating that the detected peptides were produced in a GSEC‐dependent manner. This analysis also revealed Aβs varying from 29 aa to 40 aa and from 20 aa to 38 aa in lengths for the E22F and D23F mutant substrates, respectively. Moreover, Aβ33 and minor amounts of Aβ34, Aβ29, and Aβ28 were measured for the K28F mutant substrate (Fig 1F and G ). These data support the implication of the substrate APP‐ECD in the modulation of the sequential GSEC‐mediated proteolysis and pointed at increased hydrophobicity in the Ala21‐Asp23 and S26‐Ala30 regions as the critical feature in the modulation of Aβ product length, with the Lys28 and Asp23‐Glu22 positions as key determinants of the sequential cleavage mechanism.

The prominent role of position APP C99 ‐28 in the modulation of Aβ processing let us to evaluate the effects of different amino acidic substitutions at this site on the secreted Aβ pool. We quantified both canonical and total Aβ levels in CM of HEK293T cells overexpressing WT or mutant APP C99 substrates. Total Aβ levels measured by ELISA with the 4G8 and 6E10 anti‐Aβ antibodies, as capturing and detection reagents, were used as proxy in the estimation of global endopeptidase activity.

Total Aβ, normalized to substrate expression (Fig EV2A ), demonstrated significant increases for 13 of 19 substrates, and similar levels for the K28R, K28Y, K28W, K28F, K28L, and K28I mutants, relative to WT (Fig 2A ). In contrast, all substitutions drastically reduced the summation of secreted canonical Aβs, with the exception of K28R (Figs 2B and EV2B ). The mismatch between total and canonical Aβ levels implied substantial shifts in Aβ product profiles for most of the tested mutant substrates. In addition, our analysis revealed a connection between the levels of canonical Aβs and the hydrophobicity of the substituted side chain. Note that Fig 2A and B present the aa substitutions according to the Kyte–Doolittle (K‐D) hydrophobicity scale (Fig 2C ) (Kyte & Doolittle, 1982 ).

Representative MALDI‐TOF MS spectra of IPed Aβs from CM of HEK293T cells expressing WT or mutant APP C99 substrates (data related to Fig 2F ). Cells expressing single and double valine mutant substrates were treated with 2.5 μM InhX to confirm specificity of Aβ signals.

Correlation between WT/mutant Aβ total /Aβ(37 + 38 + 40 + 42) ratios and helical propensity of the amino acid substitution (Pace & Scholtz, 1998 ). Mean ± SD; N = 3 independent experiments. AA are shown in one letter code.

As the total Aβ pool (Aβ total ) contains shorter peptides in addition to the canonical Aβs, we reasoned that the total‐to‐canonical Aβ peptide ratio (Aβ total /Aβ(37 + 38 + 40 + 42)) provides an estimate of the degree of GSEC‐mediated processivity on WT or mutant APP substrates. Assessment of this ratio showed that hydrophobic substitutions substantially increased the degree of processing of mutant substrates (Appendix Fig S2C ), and revealed a significant linear correlation between GSEC processivity and hydrophobicity at position 28 in APP C99 ‐ECD (Fig 2C ). Our analysis thus shows that hydrophobicity at the juxtamembrane region of APP C99 is a key determinant governing both cleavage efficiency and extent of Aβ processing by GSEC.

We next investigated potential additive and/or synergistic effects between APP C99 ‐28 and neighbouring (Ser26, Asn27, or Asp23) positions in the modulation of Aβ processing by GSEC. Specifically, we asked whether hydrophobicity and/or helicity in APP C99 ‐ECD influence enzyme processivity. We mutated 2 aa (D23 + K28 or N27 + K28) and 4 aa stretches (G25‐K28) in APP to Val or Ala, and analysed Aβ product levels secreted from HEK293T cells overexpressing the respective substrates (Fig 2D ). Single mutations at Asp23, Asn27, and Lys28 were used as references. Of note, both Val and Ala have high hydrophobicity indexes (Kyte & Doolittle, 1982 ; Pace & Scholtz, 1998 ) but, in contrast to Val, Ala has a high helical propensity (Gregoret & Sauer, 1998 ).

We found significant increases in total Aβs and drastic reductions in canonical Aβ levels for the double and quadruple mutations (Fig 2D and E , respectively). Furthermore, mass spectrometry‐based analysis of IPed Aβs generated from the D23V, K28V, D23V + K28V, N27V + K28V, 4xV (25–28), and 4xA (25–28) mutated substrates (Figs 2F and EV2D ) showed that very similar peptide profiles were generated from the 4xA and N27V + K28V APP C99 substrates, with Aβ33 and Aβ29 as the main products and Aβ34 and shorter (≤ 28 aa) peptides as minor ones. Aβ profiles generated from the double D23V + K28V versus single D23V or K28V mutant substrates revealed that even shorter peptides (29 aa–20 aa) were generated from the double mutant, relative to the single ones. In addition, a substantial shift towards shorter Aβ peptides, with Aβ26 as the predominant product, was observed for the 4xV substrate. Of note, the generation of the very short Aβ29‐Aβ20 peptides implies extended substrate threading, with a part of APP C99 ‐ECD going into the membrane‐embedded catalytic pore in PSEN. The next positively charged residue N‐terminally to Lys28 in the D23V + K28V substrate is Lys16 (Fig 1C ). To investigate whether this residue restricts further processing of the D23V + K28V substrate, we additionally substituted it with Val. While Aβ26 still represented the main product generated from this 3xV (16 + 23 + 28) mutant substrate (Figs 2F and EV2D ), the even shorter Aβ19 accounted for about 40% of the total Aβ products.

In conclusion, the mutation‐driven shifts on Aβ processing (N27V + K28V < 4xA < D23V + K28V < 4xV < 3xV) show cooperative effects between the tested hydrophobic substitutions, and indicate that hydrophobicity, rather than helicity (see also Fig EV2E ), in APP C99 ‐ECD is a critical feature in modulating Aβ peptide length.

We then evaluated whether this substrate‐driven mechanism also applies to the cleavage of Notch, a GSEC substrate well known for its pivotal roles in cell differentiation and proliferation (Jurisch‐Yaksi et al , 2013 ). We selected His17 in Notch (Fig 3A ) for mutagenic analysis since structural data for the GSEC‐Notch complex (PDB: 6IDF; Yang et al , 2019 ) show this residue at the juxtamembrane region of the substrate (Fig 3A and B ); thus, suggesting that it could play a role similar to that of Lys28 in APP C99 . We mutated His17 to Gln, Phe, Lys, or Asp (H17Q, H17F, H17K, or H17D) in a Notch‐based substrate (Fig 3A ), expressed WT and mutant (HA‐tagged) substrates in HEK293T cells, and IPed secreted Notch N‐terminal fragments (Nβ) using an anti‐HA antibody. Importantly, mass spectrometry analysis of the (purified) Notch substrate indicated the presence of three substrate lengths due to imprecise signal peptide (SP) cleavage (Fig 3A and C ). The observed distinct mass peaks were, however, assigned to derived Nβ products with high mass accuracy (Fig EV3 ). Consistent with previous findings (Okochi et al , 2002 , 2006 ; Wanngren et al , 2012 ), Nβ peptides with lengths ranging between 17 aa and 27 aa were generated from the WT Notch substrate (Fig 3D, top panel and E ). The analysis of mutant product profiles showed that longer Nβ26/27/29 fragments were generated from the Notch‐H17K substrate, relative to the WT. The introduction of a negatively charged aa at this position (H17D) had relatively small overall effects on Nβ processing; enhancing the generation of Nβ25/23, while lowering Nβ26 and suppressing the generation of the minor Nβ22 and Nβ17 products. Furthermore, substitution of His17 by the polar, not charged Gln (H17Q), mildly increased processivity, while its replacement with a hydrophobic aa (H17F) strongly extended Nβ processing (Fig 3D and E ). These data support a general model for GSEC processivity wherein the hydrophobic nature of the juxtamembrane region of the substrate (and ECD, as demonstrated above) critically modulates the efficiency and extent of the sequential cleavage mechanism.

Superimposition of high‐resolution maps of GSEC bound to APP C83 (PDB: 6IYC) and Notch (PDB: 6IDF) shows positions Lys28 and His17 in APP and Notch, respectively. Mass spectra of WT Notch purified through its 3x‐FLAG‐tag from HEK293T cells reveal generation of distinct substrates due to imprecise signal peptide (SP) cleavage. HA‐Nβs generated from WT and mutant (H17F, H17K, H17D, and H17Q; depicted from top to bottom) Notch substrates were IPed from CM of HEK293T and analysed by MALDI‐TOF MS. Representative mass spectra are shown; Notch‐WT and Notch‐H17F, N = 3; Notch‐H17K, ‐H17D, and ‐H17Q, N = 2 independent experiments. The different substrates (Fig 3C ) and additional N‐terminal HA‐tag were considered for mass assignment (Fig EV3 ). Most signal peaks were assigned and GSI treatment (2.5 μM InhX; data in purple) demonstrates that fragments are generated in a GSEC‐dependent manner.

Overview of detected masses and assigned Nβ fragments generated from WT and mutant Notch substrates. The respective fragment length and the corresponding length of the resulting Nβ peptide—when SP‐ and HA‐tag‐ associated residues are subtracted—are provided. Alternative SP cleavage leads to different Notch substrate lengths (see Fig 3 ); therefore, similar proteolytic cleavages result in distinct Nβ fragment masses. Only Nβ fragments are shown, of which a corresponding initial substrate mass (see Fig 3C ) was detected.

Our previous studies have shown that factors destabilizing or stabilizing GSEC‐Aβ n interactions promote the generation of longer or shorter Aβ peptides, respectively (Szaruga et al , 2017 ; Petit et al , 2022b ). We therefore investigated whether hydrophobicity at position 28 in APP C99 increases the production of shorter Aβs by stabilizing E‐S interactions. We reasoned that mutations in APP, if increasing GSEC‐Aβ n stability, would counteract the detrimental effects that detergent and/or elevated temperature exert on these complexes (Szaruga et al , 2017 ; Petit et al , 2019 ). To assess this possibility, we incubated purified GSEC and WT or mutant (K28A and K28F) APP C99 ‐3xFLAG substrates over a temperature gradient (37–55°C) and determined Aβ product profiles by mass spectrometry (Fig 4A and B ). These thermoactivity assays have been proven to be informative for the assessment of the effects of mutations and/or ligands on the stability of GSEC‐APP/Aβ n interactions (Szaruga et al , 2017 ; Petit et al , 2019 ). Consistent with previous analyses (Szaruga et al , 2017 ), detergent solubilization per se destabilized E‐S interactions, thus enhancing the production of longer Aβ42‐46 peptides from WT APP C99 at 37°C, relative to native conditions (Figs 4A and EV4A vs. 1G ); and further (thermal) destabilization shifted profiles towards production of even longer Aβ43‐48 peptides (Fig 4A (37°C vs. 55°C) and B ).

The analysis also demonstrated generation of shorter Aβ peptides from both mutant substrates (K28A, K28F) at all tested temperatures (Fig 4B ), compared to the WT, indicating that the more efficient processing of these substrates steams from mutation‐driven stabilization of E‐S interactions. We additionally tested the D23V + K28V and N27V + K28V APP C99 mutants in the detergent‐based assay (Fig EV4B ) due to their strong effects on GSEC processivity in cells (Fig 2F ). Both mutants rescued the destabilizing effects of detergent to different degrees; with the D23V + K28V mutant producing Aβ peptides as short as Aβ29 (Fig EV4B , upper panels). This demonstrated a synergistic effect of residues 28 and 23 in APP C99 ‐ECD on E‐S stability and GSEC processivity.

We next investigated whether mutations in APP C99 ‐ECD that enhance GSEC processivity rescue alterations in Aβ processing caused by AD‐linked variants in APP or PSEN that impair E‐S stability (Szaruga et al , 2017 ). We selected pathogenic mutation for which previous analyses demonstrated that their significant destabilizing effects shift Aβ profiles: APP‐T43I, APP‐I45F, PSEN1‐L166P, PSEN1‐G384A, and PSEN1‐Ins113T (also known as Intron 4) (Szaruga et al , 2017 ) (Appendix Table S1 ). In addition, PSEN1 mutations were chosen to map to different locations within PSEN. To test the effects exerted by APP C99 ‐ECD, we selected the single K28A, D23F, and N27A substitutions, as they modulate GSEC processivity to different degrees (Fig 1D–G ).

Aβ profiles generated from FAD‐linked APP‐T43I and ‐I45F substrates showed enhanced generation of Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptides (Fig 4C ) due to mutation‐driven shifts towards the Aβ42 product line (Kumar‐Singh et al , 2000 ; Chávez‐Gutiérrez et al , 2012 ; Bolduc et al , 2016 ). Expression levels were robust for all substrates (Fig EV4C ); nevertheless, we observed decreased total Aβ production for all FAD‐linked substrates, relative to the WT (Fig 4D ), as previously reported (Kumar‐Singh et al , 2000 ; Guardia‐Laguarta et al , 2010 ; Chávez‐Gutiérrez et al , 2012 ).

The insertion of a second mutation (K28A, D23F, or N27A) in APP C99 ‐ECD promoted the conversion of Aβ42 into Aβ38, relative to the respective (single) FAD‐linked mutant (Fig 4C ), leading to significant increments in the Aβ38/Aβ42 ratio (Fig 4E ). This particular ratio was not calculated for the K28A mutation since it drastically lowered Aβ42 production. However, its strong effects on Aβ processing were better assessed by the Aβ total /Aβ(37 + 38 + 40 + 42) ratio (Fig EV4D ). The K28A mutation also rescued the detrimental effects of the pathogenic (T43I and I45F) mutations on the global (endopeptidase) APP processing (K28A + T43I and K28A + I45F, respectively; Fig 4D ), while the N27A substitution only rescued total Aβ levels generated from the T43I variant (N27A + T43I). These differences are likely explained by the milder effects of the N27A mutation, relative to the K28A (Figs 1D and E , and 4C ).

To investigate the processing of mutant K28A‐, N27A‐, or D23F‐APP C99 substrates by pathogenic L166P, G384A, and Ins113T PSEN1 variants, we expressed WT or mutant APP C99 substrates in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing either WT or mutant GSEC complexes exclusively (Chávez‐Gutiérrez et al , 2012 ; Szaruga et al , 2015 ). As reported, the tested PSEN1 variants increased Aβ42 production, while decreasing shorter Aβ(37/38/40) peptides, from the WT substrate (Fig 4F ) (Chávez‐Gutiérrez et al , 2012 ; Szaruga et al , 2015 ; Petit et al , 2022a ). Processing of mutant (K28A, N27A, and D23F) APP C99 substrates by the FAD‐linked GSECs revealed enhanced production of shorter Aβ37/38 peptides while lowering Aβ42 product levels (Fig 4F ), implying a higher degree of processivity relative to the WT. In support of this, significant increases in the Aβ(38 + 37)/(Aβ40 + 42) ratio and the Aβ total /Aβ (37 + 38 + 40 + 42) ratio demonstrated more efficient processing of mutant substrates in the FAD‐linked cell lines, relative to the WT APP substrate (Figs 4G and EV4E ). In addition, total Aβ levels revealed significant increases in the global GSEC (endopeptidase) activity for the K28A mutant substrate (Fig EV4F ). As seen before for the FAD‐linked APP variants (Fig 4D ), the milder N27 substitution did not rescue the effects of the pathogenic PSEN1 substitutions on the global GSEC activity levels (Fig EV4F ).

Collectively, these findings show that hydrophobic substitutions in APP C99 ‐ECD (positions 23/27/28) counteract the destabilizing effects that pathogenic variants in APP (T43I and I45F) and PSEN (L166P, G384A, and intron 4) exert on GSEC‐Aβ interactions.

Our findings led us to hypothesize that the destabilizing effects of APP C99 ‐ECD on E‐S interactions drive product dissociation and release. This notion is supported by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations analysing the stability of the GSEC‐Aβ40 complex containing either WT or mutant Aβ40 peptides (Phe substitutions at positions Asp23, Asn27, and Lys28), showing that mutant complexes are energetically more stable than the WT E‐S complex (Fig EV4G ).

To challenge our hypothesis, we also took advantage of recent structural data mapping the binding pockets of “paradoxical” GSIs (DAPT and semagacestat) within GSEC (Bai et al , 2015 ; Yang et al , 2021 ). These small compounds partially inhibit GSEC while causing paradoxical “FAD‐mimicking” increments in the production of longer Aβs (Qi‐Takahara et al , 2005 ; Yagishita et al , 2006 ; Tagami et al , 2017 ), and recent cryo‐EM structures revealed that both GSIs bind to the substrate‐binding channel in PSEN (Bai et al , 2015 ; Yang et al , 2021 ) (Fig 5A ). While semagacestat binds in close proximity to the active site (Yang et al , 2021 ), structural and modelling data suggest that DAPT binds more centrally in the channel (Bai et al , 2015 ; Aguayo‐Ortiz et al , 2019 ). On these bases, we reasoned that DAPT and semagacestat could act as high‐affinity competitive inhibitors to the substrates. A competitive mechanism, which is never 100% efficient, would explain the partial inhibition of the global GSEC activity; while the “paradoxical” increase in production of longer Aβs would result from a more effective competition (displacement and release) of shorter Aβ substrates, than longer ones, due to their differential affinities towards the enzyme. It is worth noticing that E‐S stability/affinities progressively decrease during the sequential GSEC‐mediated cleavage (Okochi et al , 2013 ; Szaruga et al , 2017 ).

Cell‐free GSEC assays demonstrate that DAPT (left) and semagacestat (right) cause a relative increase of long Aβ species (Aβ ≥ 45), even at micromolar concentrations.

Following this reasoning, we investigated if mitigation of the product release‐promoting effects of the APP C99 ‐ECD would result in more stable E‐S complexes and thereby hamper DAPT‐ and semagacestat‐mediated inhibition. We measured the inhibitory effects of these compounds in well‐controlled in vitro assays using purified GSEC and APP C99 . As previously reported (Qi‐Takahara et al , 2005 ; Yagishita et al , 2006 ; Tagami et al , 2017 ), DAPT and semagacestat partially inhibited APP processing, while leading to increments in the production of longer Aβ species (Figs 5B and EV5A–C ). Moreover, dose‐dependent effects (mainly) resulted in relative increases in Aβ46/45 production (Figs 5B and C , and EV5A ), which is in line with previous studies (Qi‐Takahara et al , 2005 ; Yagishita et al , 2006 ; Tagami et al , 2017 ). In contrast, the transition‐state analogue (TSA) inhibitor InhX efficiently inhibited all GSEC‐mediated cleavages, as indicated by Aβ profiles (Fig EV5A–C ).

We next assessed the effects of DAPT and semagacestat on the processing of the N27A‐, K28A‐, K28F‐, and N27V + K28V mutant substrates by assessing total secreted Aβ levels in CM of HEK293T cells overexpressing these substrates. We selected mutations in APP based on their differential effects on processivity. The inhibitory profiles (Fig 5D and E , respectively) and derived IC 50 values (Appendix Tables S2 and S3 ) demonstrated significant changes in the inhibitory potencies of DAPT and semagacestat for all tested mutant substrates, besides N27A, and relative to the WT condition. As mentioned above, the milder effects of the N27A substitution (Figs 1D and E , 2D and E , and 4C–G ) probably explain the lack of significant effects. Importantly, IC 50 values determined for InhX treatment did not statistically differ from the WT IC 50 (Fig EV5D and Appendix Table S4 ). The observed shifts in GSI potency are consistent with a competitive model where binding of DAPT or semagacestat to the substrate‐binding channel, either blocks the entry for transmembrane GSEC substrates or leads to displacement (and release) of partially digested peptides.

Previous analyses have shown that imidazole‐based GSMs act as stabilizers of GSEC‐Aβ interactions (Okochi et al , 2013 ; Petit et al , 2022b ) and lower Aβ product dissociation (Okochi et al , 2013 ). Our recent analyses locate the binding pocket of a potent imidazole‐based GSM (GSM III) at the E‐S interface, between PSEN loop 1 and the herein investigated region in APP (Petit et al , 2022b ). We thus asked whether binding of the hydrophobic GSM III to E‐S complexes reduces GSI potency. HEK293T cells overexpressing WT APP C99 were treated with 10 μM GSM III and increasing concentrations of DAPT. As before, we determined DAPT inhibitory profiles from the analysis of secreted, total Aβs (Fig 5F ). We found a significant shift in IC 50 values in the presence of GSM III, relative to vehicle (DMSO: 9.6 nM; 95% CI: 4.8–18.8 nM vs. GSM III: 56.5 nM; 95% CI: 25.2–110 nM). Interestingly, the shift is mainly driven by changes in the inhibition of Aβ40 (DMSO: 9.3 nM; 95% CI: 4 to 20.6 vs. GSM III: 95.3 nM; 95% CI: 51.5 to 169.5) (Fig 5G ), rather than Aβ37 or Aβ38 (Figs 5H and EV5E , respectively and Appendix Table S5 ), indicating that GSMIII mainly stabilizes the GSEC‐Aβ40 complex and promotes its conversion to Aβ37.

## Discussion
Despite a high pathophysiological relevance, the molecular underpinnings of the processive proteolysis of Aβ by GSECs remain unclear. While various mutations in GSEC or APP have been found to impair APP sequential processing, thus promoting the generation of longer and toxic Aβs, only a few cases enhance production of shorter Aβ peptides. A notable example is position 28 in APP C99 ‐ECD, for which substitutions (Ala/Glu) have shown increases in the generation of very short peptides (≤ 37 aa) (Ren et al , 2007 ; Page et al , 2010 ; Kukar et al , 2011 ; Ousson et al , 2013 ; Jung et al , 2014 ; Petit et al , 2019 ). These observations support the notion that sequence and/or structural determinants in the substrate play a major role in modulating its sequential processing by GSEC.

Here, a mutagenic screen in cells expressing WT or mutant APP C99 substrates identified the positions Glu22‐Asp23 and Ser26‐Lys28 in APP C99 as key determinants for the processive GSEC‐mediated proteolysis (Fig 1D–G ). The introduction of Phe at these positions markedly increased the generation of shorter Aβs, while Ala substitutions resulted in milder shifts towards shorter Aβ peptides. Notably, the D23F and K28F mutations abrogated the generation of “canonical” Aβ (37/38/40/42) peptides by promoting their (further) processing into shorter peptides (≤ Aβ37). The generation of very short Aβs, ranging in length from 34 to 20 aa, implies that these substitutions not only promoted efficient sequential proteolysis of Aβ but also extended substrate processing likely by promoting (mutant) APP C99 ‐ECD threading through the transmembrane substrate‐binding channel. We note that assessment of these very short Aβ peptides relied on mass spectrometry and, although this is a well‐established method to determine Aβ profiles (Kukar et al , 2011 ; Wanngren et al , 2012 ; Jung et al , 2014 ), the different ionization and aggregation propensities of these peptides might affect their detection. The product profiles presented here thus represent estimates of relative proportions.

Mutagenic analysis of the key APP C99 ‐28 position showed that, except for Arg, all other aa substitutions promote the generation of shorter Aβs (< 37 aa) (Fig 2A–C ), as assessed by the total‐to‐canonical Aβ total /Aβ(37 + 38 + 40 + 42) ratio. The fact that all substitutions in position 28 in APP C99 , exempt for the conservative K28R, promoted enzyme processivity points at a suboptimal role of APP C99 ‐Lys28 (WT) in Aβ processing. Furthermore, this ratio also revealed a direct correlation between hydrophobicity at position APP C99 ‐28 and GSEC processivity.

Previous reports have suggested that substrate‐membrane anchoring interactions involving Lys28 and negatively charged phospholipids limit (Aβ) substrate accessibility to the active site (Kukar et al , 2011 ; Jung et al , 2014 ; Chen & Zacharias, 2022 ). While such an interaction may be at play, the drastic effects of the D23F mutation, and milder but consistent effects of hydrophobic substitutions at positions APP C99 ‐22, ‐26, and ‐27 on Aβ processing implicate the ECD of APP C99 , besides Lys28, in the regulation of both the efficiency and extent of the GSEC‐mediated sequential cleavage.

Given the proximity of Lys28 to the TMD of APP, we evaluated whether the effects of mutations may be mediated by an extension of the helical TMD by introducing single‐, double‐, and tetra‐Ala or Val key substitutions in APP C99 ‐ECD. The analysis of Aβ profiles generated from Val mutant substrates (N27V + K28V, D23V + K28V, 4xV (25–28), 3xV (K16 + D23 + K28)) pointed at hydrophobicity in APP C99 ‐ECD, rather than α‐helical propensity, as the key determinant of the efficiency and extent of sequential GSEC‐mediated Aβ proteolysis (Figs 2D–F and EV2D and E ). In addition, Aβ profiles generated from substrates carrying more than one substitution showed a degree of cooperativity between the tested positions in APP C99 ‐ECD. Structural analysis of amyloid fibres derived from human cortical tissue has shown an ionic interaction between Asp23 and Lys28 in Aβ40 (Ghosh et al , 2021 ). A salt bridge between these positions, however, does not seem to be relevant for Aβ processing since almost identical Aβ profiles are generated from the FAD‐linked APP‐D23N (Iowa) and WT substrates (Tomidokoro et al , 2010 ; Hunter & Brayne, 2018 ). Noteworthy, mutations at positions 23 and adjacent residues in APP C99 (e.g., 21 and 22) are causal for AD. The effect of these pathogenic variants is mostly linked to increased Aβ production (A21G or Δ19‐24) (Haass et al , 1994 ; Tian et al , 2010 ; de la Vega et al , 2021 ), and/or altered aggregation of mutant Aβ peptides (E22G, E22Q) (Yang et al , 2018 ). Whether mutation‐driven alterations in Aβ profiles occur and contribute to AD pathogenesis requires further investigation.

Intriguingly, our studies also implicate APP C99 ‐ECD in the modulation of the global (endopeptidase) activity levels. This is best exemplified by the significant ~3‐fold increase in the total Aβ pool generated from the 4xV(25–28) mutant APP C99 substrate (Fig 2D ). Total Aβ amounts can be used as a proxy for the endopeptidase activity levels given that they equal total AICD.

We also evaluated whether similar rules govern the GSEC‐mediated processing of Notch, which mediates essential signalling events in pathophysiology. Our analysis shows that position Notch‐His17 is the counterpart of Lys28 in APP C99 . Nβ profile analysis revealed substantially extended processing of the H17F mutant substrate (Fig 3D and E ) but reduced sequential cleavage of the H17K Notch mutant, all relative to the WT. In fact, the single H17F substitution was sufficient to facilitate the cleavage of the Notch TMD in full, supporting the notion that hydrophobicity at the juxtamembrane region of the substrate ECDs controls GSEC processivity by restraining substrate threading and promoting product release.

In this regard, the ~10 aa shift in Nβ product length generated from the H17F versus H17K substrates, and the fact that charged Glu9 and Glu6 residues are located 9–12 aa upstream of position Notch‐17 (Fig 3A ) led us to speculate that substrate threading facilitated by the H17F mutation might have been “halted” once charged Glu9/Glu6 residues reach the vicinity of the hydrophobic pore.

In the case of APP C99 , we propose that Lys28 critically contributes to an “energy barrier” that disfavours further processing of Aβ40 (~12 aa downstream) and Aβ42/38 peptides (14 aa/10 aa) in the two major production lines (Fig 1B and G ). When the first barrier (Lys28) is overcome—likely a stochastic event—, substrate threading continues and fuels sequential proteolysis until the next energy barrier is reached (Glu22‐Asp23 and potentially other polar/charged residues).

The data indicate that the K28V/F mutation only lowers the first energy barrier, while the D23V/F reduces the first and second barriers. Even though the K28V/F mutation efficiently promotes further threading and proteolysis, the intact second barrier restricts the generation of peptides shorter than 28 aa. In contrast, the D23V/F is not as efficient as K28V in overcoming the first barrier (which explains the generation of the relatively longer Aβ40/38 peptides) but does further extend proteolysis to generate very short peptides. Interestingly, when Lys16 (likely the third barrier) is mutated together with Lys28 and Asp23 (K16V + D23V + K28V, Fig 2F ), even shorter peptides are generated.

Our (thermoactivity) analysis demonstrates that hydrophobic substitutions of Lys28 (K28A/F) promote processivity by stabilizing GSEC‐Aβ interactions (Fig 4A and B ), which is consistent with the “energy barrier” model of product release. Importantly, hydrophobic substitutions in APP C99 ‐ECD (K28A, D23F, and N27A) rescue the destabilization induced by detergent solubilization or aggressive FAD‐linked mutations in PSEN1 (L166P, G384A, and Intron4) or APP (T43I, I45F) (Fig 4C–G ), although to different degrees. Our studies support a model in which polar/charged residues in the juxtamembrane of the substrate (APP C99 ‐Lys28 and H17 in Notch) serve as a “pivot” mechanism wherein other polar interactions in the ECD, potentially involving the solvent, contribute to and collectively modulate product release by destabilizing the interaction of the substrate with GSEC.

In addition, the data highlighted rescuing effects of the stabilizing mutations in APP C99 ‐ECD on the global activities of GSECs or APP‐bearing FAD‐linked mutations (Figs 4D and EV4C and F ). These findings, together with the increases in total Aβ generation observed for mutations in the juxtamembrane region of APP C99 (Fig 2A and D ), support the involvement of APP C99 ‐ECD in the regulation of global GSEC activity. Further research is, however, needed to address whether these effects are mediated by higher E‐S affinity and/or turnover.

We then investigated the pharmacological implications of this substrate ECD‐driven mechanism. Structural data show semagacestat and DAPT bound in the transmembrane catalytic pore in PSEN1 (Bai et al , 2015 ; Aguayo‐Ortiz et al , 2019 ; Yang et al , 2021 ). We reasoned that a competitive mechanism would explain the reported paradoxical and “FAD‐mimicking” activities of these GSIs on Aβ production (Qi‐Takahara et al , 2005 ; Yagishita et al , 2006 ; Tagami et al , 2017 ) (Fig 5A–C ). In this model, mitigation of the product release‐promoting effects of APP C99 ‐ECD would hamper DAPT‐ and semagacestat‐mediated inhibition. Dose–response inhibitory profiles of DAPT and semagacestat revealed that APP mutations stabilizing E‐S interactions (K28A, K28F, and N27V + K28V) significantly increase the IC 50 values of these GSIs (Fig 5D and E ), supporting a competitive mode of inhibition.

Interestingly, we observed that DAPT‐induced inhibition of total Aβ was shifted towards higher GSI concentrations when cells were treated with a potent GSEC modulator (GSM III, Fig 5F and G ). These data thus raise the possibility that binding of (hydrophobic) GSM III to the extracellular/luminal E‐S interface (Petit et al , 2022b ) lowers GSEC‐Aβ n dissociation (Okochi et al , 2013 ) by adding hydrophobicity in proximity to the key juxtamembrane region. GSM binding may not only trigger allosteric changes in the E‐S complex (Takeo et al , 2014 ; Petit et al , 2022b ) but also displace water molecules from the E‐S juxtamembrane region thus lowering the desolvation penalty for burying polar side chains of the substrate in the hydrophobic catalytic pore (substrate threading).

Our previous studies show that the shortening of the Aβ n substrate progressively weakens (sequential) E‐S assemblies (Szaruga et al , 2017 ); therefore, the substrate‐driven product release mechanism is likely to play a more prominent role as the sequential GSEC cleavage progresses. One may ask if APP C99 ‐ECD acts as “pulling force” that will ultimately lead to (Aβ) product release, what drives the processive γ‐cleavages? We speculate that the newly generated carboxy‐terminus of Aβ could exert an “inward” force extending the negatively charged C‐terminus of the de novo Aβ substrate towards the cytosolic environment, away from the negatively charged active site. This inward pulling mechanism would not only extend the substrate and facilitate substrate fitting into S1'‐S3' pockets (Bolduc et al , 2016 ), but potentially contribute to the threading mechanism that fuels the processive GSEC cleavage (“tug of war” model).

In this regard, MD simulations with either WT Aβ40 COO − or a mutant presenting a neutral C‐terminus Aβ40 NME in complex with GSEC showed that WT Aβ40 is energetically more favoured to transition from a product (P) to a cleavable substrate (S) position (ΔΔG P→S = −13.9 kcal/mol), compared to a C‐terminally neutral Aβ40 (ΔΔG G P→S = −2.4 kcal/mol) (Fig 6A and B ). We estimate that the difference in free energy for WT Aβ may be sufficient to break ~7 hydrogen bonds (approximately 1.93 kcal/mol per hydrogen bond in an α‐helix (Sheu et al , 2003 )), and thus it is reasonable to consider a contribution to the threading of the substrate in a “tug of war” model (presented in Fig 6C ). Indeed, recent MD data support the view that upon the first ε‐cut, a charged substrate carboxyl‐terminus appears in Aβ49 (Bhattarai et al , 2022 ). Our MD simulations further indicate that interactions between the C‐terminal COO − moiety in Aβ and the positively charged Arg377 and Lys380 in PSEN1 contribute to the “extension” mechanism (Fig 6A and Appendix Fig S1A and B ). PSEN1‐Arg377 and Lys380 are conserved from invertebrates to humans (Appendix Fig S2 ), supporting their potential key involvement in the sequential proteolytic mechanism.

Aβ40 as product (P, left) or substrate (S, right) with charged (COO) or neutral C‐terminus (NME) shown in upper and lower panels, respectively. The data suggest that the charged C‐terminus engages in interactions with PSEN1, specifically with the positively charged PSEN1‐R377 (see upper panels), which facilitates product ➔ substrate (P ➔ S) transition. Structural data of the GSEC‐InhX complex (PDB: 7C9I) show the TSA InhX (depicted in grey in right‐upper panel) establishing similar interactions with PSEN1, supporting the MD simulations. Binding free energies derived from MD simulations for GSEC with either WT (COO‐) or neutral (NME) Aβ40 peptides interacting as products or substrates, respectively. ΔG bind values indicate that (WT) Aβ40‐COO − is about six times more favoured to transition from P to S state, compared to neutral Aβ40‐NME (ΔΔG P→S = −13.9 kcal/mol vs. ΔΔG P→S = −2.4 kcal/mol). Mean ± SD; N = 5 independent calculation runs. The “tug of war” model of the GSEC‐mediated processing. Polar interactions involving the ECD of the substrate destabilize E‐S complexes. Since the stabilities of GSEC‐APP/Aβ complexes progressively decrease during the sequential cleavage, the “outward” pulling force exerted by the ECD of the substrate becomes more apparent with the shortening of Aβ. On the intracellular side: (i) the repulsion between the negatively charged C‐terminus of Aβ substrates (generated de novo with each ε/γ‐cut) and the negatively charged catalytic aspartate in PSEN1; and (ii) the attraction between the negatively charged substrate terminus and positively charged residues present in PSEN1 (e.g., PSEN R377), collectively exert an “inward” force that pulls the C‐terminus of Aβ towards the aqueous intracellular environment (blue gradient). Each γ‐cut promotes (further) unwinding of the substrate TMD, and this “inward” pulling force facilitates its extension C‐terminally and filling of the S1'‐S3' pockets. When the “energy barrier” created by the polar substrate ECD is overcome (stochastic event), further substrate threading occurs and proteolysis is facilitated by the “inward” pulling force. The scheme in the middle illustrates the sequential nature of this process. When the (substrate‐driven) “outward” pulling force overcomes E‐S‐stabilizing interactions, occurring within the membrane core, product release occurs.

In conclusion, the presented data assign a pivotal role to the substrate ECD in controlling both the efficiency and extent of the GSEC‐mediated sequential processing. We show that the substrate ECD‐driven destabilization of E‐S interactions underlies the product release mechanism and has pharmacological implications as (i) it facilitates the “paradoxical” effects of some GSIs (such as DAPT and semagacestat) on Aβ processing and (ii) its mitigation overcomes major E‐S disrupting challenges linked to the effects of AD‐causing mutations in PSEN1 and APP . Our findings point at this mechanism as a sweet spot for the development of pharmacological strategies selectively targeting APP/Aβ processing in AD therapy.

The monoclonal anti‐FLAG antibody (#F3165) was ordered from Sigma‐Aldrich. The 82E1 anti‐human Aβ antibody (#10323) was purchased from Tecan. Complete protease inhibitor (PI) tablets (#11836145001), DAPT (#D5942), and semagacestat (LY450139; #SML1938) were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich. GSEC inhibitor L‐685,458 was purchased from Calbiochem (#565771) and Bio‐connect (#HY‐19369). The polyethylenimine (linear, MW 25000, transfection grade (PEI 25K™)) cell transfection reagent was purchased from Tebu‐bio (#23966‐100).

Mammalian expression pSG5‐APP C99 ‐3xFLAG or pSG5‐mouseNotch‐3xFLAG constructs were subjected to site‐directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL Site‐Directed Mutagenesis Kit (#200522) from Agilent. For primers used in this study, see Appendix Table S6 . Sequencing confirmed the introduction of the respective mutations.

HEK293T cells were plated at ~70% cellular density. The next day, cultures were transiently transfected with pSG5‐APP C99 ‐3xFLAG constructs using a 1 mg/ml polyethyleneimine (PEI) solution with a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3. The medium was refreshed at 1‐day post‐transfection, and cells were placed back into the incubator for 24–30 h and collected. In case of GSM III or GSI (L‐685,458 (InhX), DAPT, or semagacestat) treatment, either compounds or vehicle (DMSO) was added to the media. The concentrations of Aβ peptides Aβ(37/38/40/42) in conditioned media were measured by a Meso Scale Discovery 4 spot ELISA (MSD ELISA). Alternatively, total secreted Aβ peptides were assessed by MSD ELISA using the 4G8 antibody (epitope: Aβ17‐24) as capturing antibody (instead of the C‐terminal‐specific anti‐Aβ antibody).

Proteolytic reactions were performed using purified ~10 nM PSEN1/APH1B γ‐secretase complexes and purified recombinant FLAG‐tagged substrates in 0.25% CHAPSO, 2.5% DMSO, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, 150 mM NaCl, and 25 mM PIPES for 20 min. Enzyme mixes (containing all components except the substrate) and substrate dilutions were pre‐incubated separately at the indicated temperatures for 5 min. In case of the thermoactivity assays, a temperature gradient ranging from 37°C to 58.5°C was applied. After pre‐incubation, the substrate was added to the enzyme mix and proteolysis proceeded for 20 min. The APP intracellular domain product levels (AICD‐3xFLAG) were analysed by SDS–PAGE and western immunoblot using the M2 anti‐FLAG antibody, and signals were quantified with an infrared imaging system. Data were normalized as % of WT conditions (WT APP C99 substrate). The final substrate concentrations in assays were saturated at 1.5 μM C99‐3xFLAG.

Additionally, in vitro activity assays, as described above, were carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated GSI (InhX, DAPT, or semagacestat) and Aβ products assayed by MALDI‐MS. Activity assay using detergent‐resistant membranes (DRMs) was performed as previously described (Szaruga et al , 2017 ) at 37°C and incubated for 90 min. DRMs were prepared from High Five insect cells, which overexpressed all four GSEC subunits.

Aβ products were analysed in urea‐based bicine/tris SDS–PAGE, as described previously (Wiltfang et al , 2002 ; Szaruga et al , 2017 ). Gel thickness was 0.75 mm and the composition of the separation gel was as follows: 8 M Urea, 11%T/5% C polyacrylamide, 0.4 M H 2 SO 4 , and 0.25% SDS, pH = 8.1. Electrophoresis was conducted at constant 100 V for around 2 h, after which gels were transferred to a PVDF membrane and western immunoblot with 82E1 antibody, biotinylated anti‐mouse IgG, and streptavidin‐HRP was performed. Signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence with the Fujifilm LAS‐3000 Imager.

Human GSEC, APP C99 , and Notch constructs were purified as previously described (Szaruga et al , 2017 ). Human WT PSEN1, NCSTN‐GFP, APH1B, and PEN2 cDNAs were cloned into the pAcAB4 or pOET1 transfer vector (BD Biosciences). Co‐transfection of the transfer vector (containing the heterologous cDNAs) and flashBacGoldTM DNA (Oxford Expression Technologies) in Sf9 cells allowed homologous recombination and production of baculoviruses bearing the four essential subunits of the GSEC complex. A PreScission protease cleaving site (LeuGluValLeuPheGln/GlyPro) and GFP were cloned at the C‐terminal site of NCSTN. Protease complexes were expressed in High Five insect cells. Infected High Five cells were collected at 72 h post‐infection and lysed in 2% CHAPSO (Anatrace) buffer (25 mM pipes pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitors (PI)). Affinity purification was carried out using a high‐affinity anti‐GFP nanobody covalently coupled to agarose beads (NHS‐activated beads, GE Healthcare) in a 3:1 ratio (mg:ml). PreScission protease cleavage between NCT and GFP eluted untagged g‐secretase complexes (buffer composition: 25 mM pipes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% CHAPSO, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT). Finally, removal of the GST‐tagged PreScission protease by immunoaffinity pulldown using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) was performed and the purity of GSEC complexes was assessed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining (InstantBlue Protein Stain, Expedeon).

In the case of APP C99 ‐3xFLAG, the purification was performed in the same way as GSEC purification with the difference that the transfer vector was either pAcAB4 or pOET1. APP C99 was solubilized in buffer containing 1% n‐dodecyl‐β‐D‐maltopyranoside (DDM) as detergent (Sol‐Grade; Cliniscience). (Final APP C99 buffer composition: 25 mM pipes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% DDM, and 5% glycerol.)

In order to validate the mouse Notch‐3xFLAG substrate by mass spectrometry, purification was performed from HEK293T cells, by transiently transfecting the cells with WT or mutant (H17F, H17K, H17D, and H17Q) constructs. Cells were treated with either the TSA L‐685,458 or vehicle (DMSO), harvested, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P‐40, and 1× PI, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Membrane‐solubilized protein fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation at ~100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. FLAG‐tagged recombinant substrates were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti‐FLAG M2‐agarose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocols. All substrates were eluted in 100 mM glycine HCl, pH 2.8, and 0.03% DDM, and immediately neutralized to pH 7 by the addition of 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.0.

dKO hPSEN1/2 MEF cells were rescued with WT or respective mutant hPS1 GSECs (L166P or G384A hPS1 FAD variants) as described previously (Petit et al , 2019 ). Cells stably expressing WT/mutant PSEN1s were selected. WT/mutant PSEN1 MEFs were electroporated with WT or mutant APP C99 , and Aβ peptides were quantified by ELISA. Raw values were used to calculate the Aβ profiles, where the addition of all canonical peptides is considered 100%.

Aβ37, Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 product levels were quantified on Multi‐Spot 96‐well plates pre‐coated with anti‐Aβ37, Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 antibodies obtained from Janssen Pharmaceutica using multiplex MSD technology. For assessment of total Aβ, single‐spot 96‐well plates (# L15XA‐6, Multi‐Array 96 well plate) were coated with the 4G8 anti‐APP/Aβ antibody (epitope: 17–24; Aβ numbering). MSD plates were blocked with 150 ml/well 0.1% casein buffer for 2 h at room temperature (600 rpm) and rinsed 5 x with 200 ml/well washing buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween‐20). Thirty microlitre of SULFO‐TAG JRF/AbN/25 or 6E10 detection antibody diluted in blocking buffer was mixed with 30 μL of standards (Aβ37, Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 peptides) or reaction samples diluted in blocking buffer and 50 μL per well were loaded. After overnight incubation at 4°C, plates were rinsed with washing buffer and 150 μl/well of MSD Read Buffer T (Tris‐based buffer containing tripropylamine, purchased from Meso Scale Discovery) was added. Plates were read immediately on MSD Sector Imager 6000.

HEK293T cells cultured in 10 cm 2 dishes in DMEM/F‐12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS were transfected with wild‐type or mutant APP C99 ‐expressing constructs. At day 1 post‐transfection, the cell medium was replaced with low‐serum medium (DMEM/F‐12 medium containing 2% FBS), and depending on the experiment, either DMSO or L‐685,458 at a final concentration of 2,5 μM was additionally added to the medium. Twenty‐four to thirty hours after medium replacement, conditioned media were collected.

To improve MS peak intensity for hydrophobic Aβ peptides, Tween‐20 at a final concentration of 0.025% was added to conditioned media as previously described (Portelius et al , 2007 ). Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated using the 4G8, 6E10, anti‐HA, or 82E1 antibody (4 μg/10 ml of conditioned media) overnight at 4°C on rotation. Then, 40 μl protein G agarose beads (pre‐blocked in PBS/0.5% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 pH 7.4) were added and incubation continued for 3 h. Beads were washed in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 pH 7.4 two times. The last wash in PBS/0.01% Tween 20 pH 7.4 was performed to reduce the detergent concentration. Dry beads were frozen at −20°C and subsequently subjected to MS analysis.

Beads were resuspended in 15 μl of SA matrix solution (38 mg/ml in water/ACN/TFA 20/80/2.5 (v/v/v)), and 30 nM Aβ1‐28 was added (internal standard, IS). The sample was vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 5 min at ~1,000 g . The supernatant (matrix–analyte mix) was collected, and 1 μl (nine technical replicates) was applied on a MALDI AnchorChip Target (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) using dried droplet preparation and air‐dried. All mass spectra were acquired on a rapifleX MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a 10 kHz Smartbeam™ laser using the AutoXecute function of the FlexControl 4.2. In the case of detergent assays, reactions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the matrix solution, 30 nM of IS was added, and then analysed as described above. The acquisition method was calibrated using a 1/1/1 (v/v/v) mix of protein calibration standard I, peptide standard II (both Bruker Daltonics), and Aβ calibration standard using quadratic calibration. Briefly, each spectrum was acquired in linear positive mode within the mass range of m/z 2,000–20,000 with a low mass gate at m/z 1,800. A total of 25,000 laser shots were automatically accumulated for each sample by random walk. Mass spectrometer parameters were balanced for optimal resolution and sensitivity in the Aβ peptide mass range (4–5 kDa). Subsequently, mass spectra were Savitzky–Golay smoothed and baseline subtracted with top‐hat method and internally single‐point calibrated (using Aβ1‐28 peak). Average MALDI‐TOF MS profiles were generated from nine single spectra and peaks were detected form the resulting average spectra with an S/N > 3 using “SuperSmoother” method. All processing was done using R 4.0.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the MALDIquant package (v. 1.19.3, Gibb & Strimmer, 2012 ). Generally, mass peaks within a mass error of 500 ppm (part per million) were annotated. For graphical summaries presented here, only peptide masses are shown which appeared in at least two independent experiments.

Starting structures of the Aβ40 γ37 (substrate state) for the MD simulations were taken from the homology models generated in our previous work (Chen & Zacharias, 2022 ). The starting structure of Aβ40 γ40 (product state) was prepared by truncating the residues C‐terminal to Val40 from the Aβ43γ40 from the homology models of our previous work (Chen & Zacharias, 2022 ). Phe mutations of Aβ40, including D23F, N27F, and K28F, at the substrate state were introduced using tleap from AmberTools22 (Case et al , 2022 ) D385 is protonated and D257 is unprotonated in the Aβ43 γ40 system, based on a recently published pH calculation (Guzmán‐Ocampo et al , 2023 ). Both D257 and D385 are deprotonated in the Aβ40 γ40 system repelling the substrate C‐terminus in the product state. The enzyme–substrate complexes were solvated with 400 POPC molecules and TIP3P water with 0.15 M potassium chloride using OPM (Lomize et al , 2012 ) and CHARMM‐GUI (Lee et al , 2016 ) servers. Interactions between atoms are described by ff14SB (Maier et al , 2015 ) for proteins, lipi21 (Dickson et al , 2022 ) for lipids, and TIP3P (Mark & Nilsson, 2001 ) for water molecules. Two variations of the substrate C‐terminus in AmberTools22 (Case et al , 2022 ), including the charged carboxylic acid (COO‐) and the neutral NME‐capping group, were used to investigate the influence of charge on substrate binding.

Each simulation underwent energy minimization and equilibration process before the production run. First, The energy of the simulation box was minimized with 10 kcal · mol −1 · Å −2 and 2.5 kcal · mol −1 · Å −2 positional restraint on the proteins and the lipid, respectively, for 7,000 steps using pmemd from AMBER (Mark & Nilsson, 2001 ). Then, the simulation box was equilibrated for 400 ps with gradually releasing positional restraint, from 10 kcal · mol −1 · Å −2 and 2.5 kcal · mol −1 · Å −2 to 2.5 kcal · mol −1 · Å −2 , and no restraint on protein and lipid, respectively. Five simulations of 200 ns each were performed for data analysis. Integration time step was set to 4 fs with the use of SHAKE algorithm (Andersen, 1983 ) and hydrogen mass repartitioning method (Hopkins et al , 2015 ) with a non‐bonded cut‐off distance of 9 Å. A temperature of 303.15 K and a pressure of 1 bar were maintained using Langevin dynamics (Goga et al , 2012 ) and Berendsen barostate (Berendsen et al , 1984 ), respectively, in the equilibration and production run process using the GPU‐accelerated pmemd package from AMBER (Salomon‐Ferrer et al , 2013 ). The interaction free energy between Aβ40 and γ‐secretase at the product state (Aβ40 γ40 ) and the substrate state (Aβ40 γ37 ) was calculated with molecular mechanics coupled with generalized born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/GBSA) method using MMPBSA.py (Miller et al , 2012 ). Only the last 100 ns of each simulation was submitted for the energy calculation using GB model II (igb = 5) (Onufriev et al , 2004 ). Because no lipid was present between Aβ40 and γ‐secretase around the regions of interest, an external dielectric constant of 80 was used.

Statistical analysis of the data was accomplished using the GraphPad Prism 9 software. Unpaired t ‐tests or one‐way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test were used to test the significance of the changes as indicated in the figure legends. P ‐value < 0.05 was used as a predetermined threshold for statistical significance.
