# Title
STAT3 is a critical regulator of astrogliosis and scar formation after spinal cord injury

# Abstract
Signaling mechanisms that regulate astrocyte reactivity and scar formation after spinal cord injury (SCI) are not well defined. We used the Cre-loxP system under regulation of the mouse GFAP promoter to conditionally delete the cytokine and growth factor signal transducer, STAT3, from astrocytes. After SCI in GFAP-Cre-Reporter mice, over 99% of spinal cord cells that exhibited Cre activity as detected by reporter protein expression were GFAP-expressing astrocytes. Conditional deletion of STAT3 (STAT3-CKO) from astrocytes in GFAP-Cre-loxP mice was confirmed in vivo and in vitro . In uninjured adult STAT3-CKO mice, astrocytes appeared morphologically similar to those in STAT3+/+ mice except for a partially reduced expression of GFAP. In STAT3+/+ mice, activated STAT3 (pSTAT3) was not detectable in astrocytes in uninjured spinal cord, and pSTAT3 was markedly up regulated after SCI in astrocytes and other cell types near the injury. Mice with STAT3-CKO from astrocytes exhibited attenuated up-regulation of GFAP, failure of astrocyte hypertrophy and pronounced disruption of astroglial scar formation after SCI. These changes were associated with increased spread of inflammation, increased lesion volume and partially attenuated motor recovery over the first 28 days after SCI. These findings indicate that STAT3 signaling is a critical regulator of certain aspects of reactive astrogliosis and provide further evidence that scar-forming astrocytes restrict the spread of inflammatory cells after SCI.

## Introduction
Astrocytes respond to spinal cord injury (SCI) and other central nervous system (CNS) insults with a variety of different potential changes, including alterations in many types of molecular expression, cellular hypertrophy, migration, proliferation and scar formation ( Reier and Houle, 1988 ; Norton et al., 1992 ; Amat et al., 1996 ; Silver and Miller, 2004 ). The inter- and intra-cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate different aspects of astrocyte reactivity (astrogliosis) in response to CNS insults in vivo are not well characterized. These signaling mechanisms are important because they determine not only the degree to which reactive astrocytes maintain, modify or suppress the functions that astrocytes normally execute in uninjured tissue, but also whether or not reactive astrocytes initiate new, injury-induced activities that may be beneficial or harmful. A better understanding of such signaling mechanisms may lead to novel strategies to attenuate negative aspects and augment positive aspects of astrocyte reactivity, and may contribute to combinatorial treatment strategies that address multiple aspects of SCI ( Silver and Miller, 2004 ; Filbin, 2006 ; Cafferty et al., 2008 ; Lu and Tuszynski, 2008 ).

Astrocytes, like other cells, respond to multiple extracellular signaling molecules through a complex assortment of intracellular signal transduction pathways that activate cAMP, MAP kinases, NF-κB, Jak-STATs and others, and several of these pathways have been implicated as potential regulators of astrogliosis ( Shafit-Zagardo et al., 1988 ; John et al., 2003 ; Brambilla et al., 2005 ; Okada et al., 2006 ). The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a member of the Janus kinases-STAT (Jak-STAT) signaling family that transduces signals for many cytokines and growth factors ( Aaronson and Horvath, 2002 ). STAT3 is activated in many cell types by a number of cytokines implicated in injury responses ( Takeda et al., 1997 ), several of which, including IL-6, CNTF, LIF, EGF and TGFα, have been implicated as triggers of reactive astrogliosis ( Balasingam et al., 1994 ; Winter et al., 1995 ; Klein et al., 1997 ; Rabchevsky et al., 1998 ; Levison et al., 2000 ; Albrecht et al., 2002 ). In the CNS, STAT3 is expressed by astrocytes, neurons and other cell types ( Cattaneo et al., 1999 ), and activation of STAT3 by phosphorylation increases markedly after CNS insults ( Acarin et al., 2000 ; Justicia et al., 2000 ; Sriram et al., 2004 ; Yamauchi et al., 2006 ). Thus STAT3 is a good candidate to be an activator of certain aspects of astrogliosis.

In this study we investigated the role of STAT3 signaling in regulating specific aspects of the response of astrocytes to spinal cord injury (SCI) in vivo by using the Cre/loxP system ( Sauer, 1994 ) to achieve a conditional gene deletion or knockout (CKO) of STAT3 in astrocytes. We crossbred mice in which Cre recombinase (Cre) was targeted to astrocytes using the mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter ( Garcia et al., 2004 ; Sofroniew, 2005 ) with mice in which loxP sites were inserted to flank exon 22 of the STAT3 gene, which encodes a phosphorylation site critical for STAT3 activation ( Takeda et al., 1998 ).

## Methods
All GFAP-STAT3-CKO and control mice were obtained from the same breeding colony of GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 crossed with STAT3-loxP mice on a C57Bl6 background. GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 were generated as described ( Garcia et al., 2004 ), using a 15kb mouse GFAP promoter cassette (clone 445) containing all introns, promoter regulatory elements, exons and 2kb of 3′ and 2.5kb of 5′ flanking regions of the mouse GFAP gene ( Johnson et al., 1995 ). GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 were cross bred with STAT3-loxP mice having loxP sites flanking exon 22 of the STAT3 gene, which encodes a tyrosine residue (tyr705) essential for STAT3 activation, were generated as described ( Takeda et al., 1998 ). Control mice of several genotypes were compared, including mice that (i) carried no transgene or loxP sites (i.e. non-transgenic or ‘wild-type’ mice), (ii) were only heterozygous for GFAP-Cre and carried no STAT3-loxP, or (iii) were only heterozygous or homozygous for STAT3-loxP and carry no GFAP-Cre. These three groups exhibited no significant differences (ANOVA) in any parameter evaluated and data from different controls were pooled. GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 were also cross bred with two lines of reporter mice that expressed either β-galactosidase (β-gal) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) down stream of loxP flanked stop signals via either the ROSA promoter for β-gal ( Soriano, 1999 ), or a CMV-enhanced actin promoter for GFP ( Novak et al., 2000 ). Mice were housed in a 12 hour light/dark cycle in an SPF facility with controlled temperature and humidity and allowed free access to food and water, and experiments conducted according to protocols approved by the Chancellor's Animal Research Committee of the Office for Protection of Research Subjects at UCLA.

Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared as described ( Imura et al., 2003 ; Imura et al., 2006 ). Briefly, cells were derived from cortices of newborn (P0-P2) mice and seeded in medium consisting of DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine calf serum. Once confluence was attained, cultures were shaken to remove nonadherent cells and replated (passage 1); when confluence was attained again, this procedure was repeated (passage 2), resulting in cultures of >95% GFAP-positive cells.

All surgical procedures were performed under general anesthesia with isoflurane in oxygen-enriched air using an operating microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and rodent stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Laminectomy of a single vertebra was performed and moderate crush SCI were made at the level of L1/L2 using No. 5 Dumont forceps (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) ground down to a tip width of 0.4mm and modified with a spacer so that at maximal closure a 0.4 mm space remained. This closure distance was selected by comparing results achieved with forceps that closed to 1.0 or 0 mm spaces ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ). Forceps were used to compress the cord laterally from both sides for 10 seconds.

The effects of moderate crush SCI were compared in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice and control mice of different genotypes (see Animals above). Animals were randomly assigned numbers and evaluated blind to genotype and experimental condition. Mice were evaluated on behavioral tasks to assess hindlimb function and by qualitative and quantitative histological and biochemical procedures as described below.

Mice were evaluated using three behavioral tasks selected to assess hindlimb function before and on days 3, 7, 10, 14 and 28 after SCI ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ).

The objective of this evaluation was to assess gross voluntary use of the hindlimbs, and did not attempt to define subtle differences in usage that might be correlated with specific neural mechanisms that might underlie dysfunctions. We used a simple six-point scale ( Fehlings and Tator, 1995 ), which focused on gross aspects of hindlimb function, and which we found more appropriate for our goals and our model of upper lumbar SCI. Mice were evaluated in an open field by the same two observers blind to the experimental condition, and received a score for gross voluntary movement of each hindlimb using an operationally defined six-point scale: 0) No voluntary hindlimb movement; 1) Little voluntary hindlimb movement; 2) Hindlimb movements obvious but did not assist in weight support or stepping; 3) Hindlimb assisted in occasional weight support and plantar placement, but not in stepping; 4) Hindlimb used for weight support and stepping, but obvious disability; 5) Hindlimb function essentially normal ( Fehlings and Tator, 1995 ). Left and right hindlimbs were scored separately and averaged.

To assess balance and ability to coordinate stepping animals were placed on a single lane rotorod (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) for three trials per session. The rotorod was set for constant acceleration from 3.0 to 30 rpm over 300 seconds and animals were scored on seconds to fall. Each trial was scored individually and averaged for a final score per session.

To assess stepping patterns of forelimbs and hindlimbs after injury, animals were required to run along a paper-lined runway (3ft. long, 3 in. wide) to obtain an edible treat in a darkened box at the end. The plantar surfaces of fore- and hindlimbs were brushed with red and black non-toxic paint, respectively, and qualitative analysis was performed on plantar stepping, stride length and width, toe or dorsal foot drags, and overall stepping ability ( Ma et al., 2001 ). All statistical evaluations were performed by ANOVA with post hoc, independent pair wise analysis (Prism®, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The group sizes used for all statistical comparisons of behavioral evaluations of motor performance were n=8 or more subjects per experimental group.

After terminal anesthesia by barbiturate overdose, mice were perfused transcardially with buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were removed, post-fixed for a further 2 hours and cryoprotected in buffered 30% sucrose overnight. 40 μm transverse or 30μm horizontal frozen sections were prepared using a cryostat microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and processed for various kinds of histological evaluation as described previously ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ). Brightfield immunohistochemistry was performed using biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector, Burlingame, CA), biotin-avidin-peroxidase complex (Vector) and diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector) as the developing agent. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed using AlexaFluor tagged secondary antibodies Alexa 488 (green), Alexa 568 (red) or Alexa 350 (blue) (Molecular Probes). Primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-GFAP (1:2000 or 1:20,000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), rat anti-GFAP (1:1000 or 1:5000, Zymed Laboratories); rabbit anti-Cre (1:4000; ICN); mouse anti-cre (1:100 (Covance); rabbit anti-β˜-gal (1:400 or 1:16,000; Sigma), rabbit anti-GSTπ (1:150; BD Sciences); mouse anti-NeuN (1:400 or 1:4000 Chemicon); rabbit anti-vimentin (1:6000; Sigma); rabbit anti-glutamine synthetase (1:4000; Sigma); rabbit anti-STAT3 (1:100; Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (tyr705; 1:150; Cell Signaling); rat anti-mouse CD-45 (1:100 or 1:2000; PharMingen, La Jolla, CA); rabbit anti-fibronectin (1:1000 or 1:5000; Dako). Staining with cresyl violet or luxol fast blue was conducted according to standard procedures. Stained sections were examined and photographed using brightfield and fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and scanning confocal laser microscopy (Leica, Nussloch, Germany).

Cell counts, cell volume and lesion volume, were determined using unbiased sampling ( Gundersen et al., 1988 ) and stereological image analysis software (StereoInvestigator® or NeuroLucida®, MicroBrightField, Williston, VT) operating a computer-driven microscope regulated in the x, y and z axes (Zeiss) in a manner described in detail previously ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ). For cell density and cell volume measurements in uninjured mice, separate grey and white matter areas were traced in three randomly selected sections per mouse in the L1/L2 region; three sampling frames of 350×350μm were selected per section at random within the traced region by the image analysis software (StereoInvestigator®) and computer-driven stage, and cell numbers were counted and the volume of the counted tissue was calculated. In addition, cell sizes were measured using the nucleator method on over 100 cells per animal. For cell volume determinations after SCI, separate grey and white matter areas to be sampled were traced as 200μm wide regions immediately adjacent to the wound margin; sampling frames of 35×35μm were selected at random within the traced region by the image analysis software (StereoInvestigator®) and computer-driven stage, and cell sizes were measured using the nucleator method on over 100 cells per animal. Lesion volume determinations were made by tracing lesion areas and spinal cord outlines in series of sequentially spaced sections using image analysis software (NeuroLucida®) followed by three-dimensional reconstruction ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ). All statistical evaluations were performed by ANOVA with post hoc, independent pair wise analysis (Prism®, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The group sizes used for all statistical comparisons of morphometric determinations were n=4 or more subjects per experimental group.

Total protein was extracted from freshly harvested spinal cord tissue using a lysis buffer: 50mM Tris-HCL, 150mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10mM NaF, 10mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) 1 mM sodium orthovanadate Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 4 μg/ml leupptin and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 25 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was used for measurements of protein as described ( Qi et al., 2005 ; Liu and Xu, 2006 ): Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Protein preparations were separated by sodium dodecly sulfate polyacrylammide gel electrophoesis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinlyidene difluoaride (PVDF) membrane and blocked with 5% nonfat milk TBST buffer and probed using various antibodies. The Western blots were visualized using Amersham ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. Equivalence of protein loading was verified by probing for actin. Antibodies used were: goat anti-GFAP (1:5000, Dako); rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (tyr705; 1:500; Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-pSTAT1 (tyr701; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-actin (1:500; Sigma).

## Results
To test the specificity of Cre targeting to astrocytes at the single cell level in the spinal cord, we crossbred GFAP-Cre mice (line 73.12) with two strains of reporter mice that encoded the reporter proteins β-gal or GFP. Single and double labeling immunohistochemistry showed that both Cre ( Fig. 1A,C ) and the reporter β-gal ( Fig. 1B,D ) were expressed throughout the spinal cord by cells with a distribution, density and morphology typical of astrocytes, and that essentially all cells that expressed detectable levels of Cre ( Fig. 1E ) or β-gal ( Fig. 1F ) also expressed GFAP. We quantitatively assessed the efficacy and specificity of Cre enzymatic activity using confocal microscopic analysis of the reporter protein GFP in combination with immunofluorescence of chemical markers for astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia/inflammatory cells in the spinal cord after SCI ( Figs. 2 , 3 ). In both grey ( Fig. 2A ) and white ( Fig. 2B ) matter of spinal cord, over 99% of cells that expressed reporter protein also expressed the astrocyte marker, GFAP ( Fig. 2E ). Conversely, over 97% of cells that expressed GFAP also expressed reporter protein ( Figs. 2E ). We found no cells in the spinal cord that expressed both reporter protein and the neuron marker, NeuN ( Figs. 2C,E ). In addition, no cells expressed both reporter protein and CD45, a marker for microglia and all white blood cells ( Figs. 2D,E ). In both grey ( Fig. 3A,C,F ) and white ( Fig. 3B,D,F ) matter of the spinal cord, the vast majority of reporter positive cells did not express the widely used marker of mature oligodendrocytes, GSTπ ( Tansey and Cammer, 1991 ; Arnett et al., 2001 ; Gregg et al., 2007 ), and vise versa. A small percent of cells was co-labeled for reporter and GSTπ ( Fig. 3E,F ) and these cells had the morphological appearance of astrocytes and also expressed GFAP ( Fig. 3E,F ), suggesting that these cells were a subtype of astrocyte. Our findings are consistent with reports by others that the mouse GFAP promoter is not active in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in spinal cord ( Casper et al., 2007 ). Together, these findings indicate that in the spinal cord of 73.12 GFAP-Cre-Reporter mice, essentially all cells that exhibit Cre activity (i.e. reporter protein) are GFAP expressing astrocytes, and that Cre activity is not exhibited by neurons, oligodendrocytes or microglia/inflammatory cells.

As reported elsewhere ( Garcia et al., 2004 ), the forebrain contains anatomically restricted populations of juvenile and adult neural progenitors that express GFAP, and in mice of the line 73.12 used in this study, Cre activity and reporter expression are present in small, specific populations of neurons in olfactory bulb and hippocampus. We have also noted reporter expression in a few other scattered populations of neurons such as in a small number of late born neurons in superficial layers (2 and 3) of cerebral cortex (unpublished observations). To look for potential reporter expression specifically in afferent neurons that project to the spinal cord and might influence the response to SCI, we conducted single cell confocal microscopic analysis in GFP reporter mice after injection of retrograde tract-tracer into the same region of the lumbar spinal cord that was targeted for SCI and evaluated histologically and that contains the lumbar hind limb stepping center at L1/L2 ( Kiehn, 2006 ). In all areas examined, including brain stem reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, red nuclei, motor cortex and propriospinal pathways, we found that no neurons were co-labeled for retrograde tracer and reporter protein ( Fig. 4 ). These findings show that in mice of the line 73.12 used here there are no reporter expressing neurons in spinal cord or any of the spinal cord afferent regions that project to the lumbar spinal cord evaluated after SCI in this study. Together, our various specificity tests were all consistent with the view that our GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 comprise a specific and selective model for evaluating the effects on of conditional gene from astrocytes in spinal cord under different experimental conditions in vivo .

To delete STAT3 from GFAP-expressing astrocytes, we crossbred 73.12 GFAP-Cre mice with mice having loxP sites flanking exon 22 of the STAT3 gene, which contains a phosphorylation site critical for STAT3 activation. CNS tissue from GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice contained a PCR product that was not present in controls and corresponded to recombined-STAT3 (R-STAT3) with exon 22 excised as expected after recombination of these loxP sites ( Fig. 5A ). To test the efficiency of the conditional gene deletion, we conducted Western blot analysis of primary cell cultures of astrocytes from perinatal mice. Primary astrocytes from both control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice grew well in serum under standard conditions. However, whereas control cultures exhibited robust expression of both STAT3 or pSTAT3, both molecules were essentially undetectable in cultures GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice ( Fig. 5B ), demonstrating effective gene deletion in our Cre-loxP model. GFAP-STAT3-CKO offspring were obtained in expected Mendelian ratios, and developed and thrived in a manner indistinguishable from non-transgenic or partially transgenic littermates. The macroscopic appearance, size and weight ( Fig. 5C ), as well as the cytoarchitecture and myelination ( Fig. 5D-H ) of brains and spinal cords from uninjured GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice were indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates at all ages.

Jak-STAT signaling through STAT3 and STAT1 has been implicated in astrogliogenesis ( Bonni et al., 1997 ; He et al., 2005 ). We therefore carefully evaluated the appearance of astroglia in the spinal cord of uninjured GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice in vivo . To do so, we conducted immunohistochemistry for (i) GFAP, the canonical marker for astrocytes, (ii) glutamine synthetase, a marker expressed predominantly by astrocytes ( Norenberg, 1979 ; Wilhelmsson et al., 2004 ) and (iii) for the transgenically targeted reporter molecule, β-gal, in uninjured control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Qualitative analysis of all three markers indicated that astrocytes in grey and white matter were similar in size, shape and overall appearance in control and STAT3-CKO mice ( Fig. 6 ). Although astrocytes in grey matter exhibited a somewhat reduced staining for GFAP in STAT3-CKO mice ( Fig. 6A,B, F,G ), the morphology and density of astrocytes stained for either glutamine synthetase ( Fig. 6C,H ) or β-gal ( Fig. 6D,E,I,J ) were indistinguishable in control and STAT3-CKO mice. Quantitative analysis of cells stained for glutamine synthetase ( Fig. 6K,L ) and β-gal ( Fig. 6M,N ) indicated that both the cell size and the cell density of astrocytes did not differ significantly in spinal cord of control and STAT3-CKO mice.

Crush injury is a well-characterized and validated experimental model of SCI ( Inman et al., 2002 ; Faulkner et al., 2004 ; Plemel et al., 2008 ). In the following experiments, we compared the effects of a moderate crush SCI at L1/L2 on various aspects of the response to SCI in GFAP-STAT3-CKO and control mice.

Although STAT3 is expressed by both neurons and glia in adult spinal cord ( Cattaneo et al., 1999 ), levels of active, phosphorylated-STAT3 (pSTAT3) are low or undetectable in uninjured adult CNS tissue but increase markedly after insults such as SCI ( Acarin et al., 2000 ; Justicia et al., 2000 ; Sriram et al., 2004 ; Yamauchi et al., 2006 ). To determine the time course of STAT3 activation in astrocytes after our moderate crush SCI, we used double labeling of immunohistochemistry for pSTAT3 in combination with detection of GFP as an astrocyte marker in GFAP-Cre-reporter mice ( Fig. 7 ). In uninjured control mice, pSTAT3 was not immunohistochemically detectable in astrocytes and was occasionally observed in cells with the size and appearance of neurons ( Fig. 7A,B ). In contrast, at one day after SCI in the lesion core (epicenter), essentially all GFP-positive astrocytes in GFAP-Cre-reporter mice were strongly positive for pSTAT3 ( Fig. 7C ). At one day after SCI in the tissue surrounding the lesion core, the majority of GFP-positive astrocytes were detectably positive for pSTAT3 and there were many pSTAT3 positive but GFP-negative cells, a portion of which had the appearance of neurons ( Fig. 7D ). At two and three days after SCI in the tissue surrounding the lesion, a majority of GFP-positive astrocytes remained detectably positive for pSTAT3 and there were many pSTAT3 positive but GFP-negative cells ( Fig. 7E,F ). By seven days after SCI, only a small proportion of GFP-positive astrocytes were positive for pSTAT3 and these were along the immediate peripheral margins of the lesion in the region of the forming glial scar, and there were many pSTAT3 positive but GFP-negative cells ( Fig. 7G,H ). At fourteen days after SCI, GFP-positive astrocytes were rarely positive for pSTAT3, and a number of pSTAT3-positive but GFP-negative cells were present (not shown). These findings show that a substantial proportion of astrocytes in the immediate vicinity of the lesion are activated by pSTAT3 over a several day period after SCI in wild-type mice. We found no detectable levels of pSTAT3 in astrocytes after SCI in STAT3-CKO mice (data not shown).

We also examined pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels using Western blot analysis. In agreement with reports by others ( Yamauchi et al., 2006 ), both pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 were undetectable in uninjured spinal cord tissue and increased to detectable levels after SCI in control mice ( Fig. 8 ). In our GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, both pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 were also undetectable in uninjured spinal cord tissue. After SCI in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, pSTAT1 increased in a manner that was indistinguishable from that in control mice, whereas pSTAT3 exhibited only a small increase that was markedly attenuated compared with the increase in control mice ( Fig. 8 ).

We next determined the effects of astroglial STAT3-CKO on reactive astrogliosis by examining astrocyte activation as indicated by increased expression of intermediate filament proteins and by quantifying the degree of astrocyte hypertrophy. Western blot analysis ( Fig. 8 ) confirmed our immunohistochemical observation ( Fig. 6A,B,F,G ) of somewhat reduced levels of GFAP expression in the spinal cord of uninjured GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice relative to controls. Western blot analysis also showed that at three days after SCI, GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice exhibited an attenuated, but not absent, up regulation of GFAP as compared with controls ( Fig. 8 ). Similar observations were made using immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 9 ), which showed a robust up regulation of both GFAP and vimentin at various time points after SCI in control mice ( Fig. 9A,C ), whereas this up regulation was markedly attenuated in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice ( Fig. 9B,D ).

To evaluate astrocyte hypertrophy after SCI, we used computer assisted morphometric analysis to measure the cell volume of astrocytes that expressed the reporter protein β-galactosidase in either control mice or GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, in a precisely defined 200 μm wide boundary zone around the entire lesion in both grey and white matter. After SCI in control mice, astrocytes exhibited a pronounced and significant hypertrophy of their cell volumes in both grey Fig. 10A,E,I ) and white ( Fig. 10C,G,J ) matter when compared with uninjured mice. This hypertrophy of astrocytes after SCI did not occur in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice in either grey Fig. 10B,F,I ) or white Fig. 10D,H,J ) matter and the astrocytes in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice were significantly smaller that those in control mice after SCI and were not significantly larger than in uninjured mice.

Because of the failure of astrocyte hypertrophy in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice after SCI, we examined in more detail the formation of the glia scar around the SCI lesion, using immunohistochemistry of astrocyte markers (β-galactosidase, GFAP or vimentin) alone or in combination with markers of fibroblast lineage cells. Fibroblast lineage cells are an important cellular component of the glial scar and interact extensively with astrocytes in an organized manner to form the glial scar around CNS lesions ( Bundesen et al., 2003 ; Silver and Miller, 2004 ). By 14 days after SCI in control mice, reactive astrocytes within the lesion boundary zone were densely packed and closely abutting with tightly interdigitating processes that formed a continuous unbroken boundary around the central core of the lesion in both grey and white matter ( Figs. 9A,C,E,G , 10A,C ). In agreement with descriptions by others ( Bundesen et al., 2003 ), we found that fibromeningeal cells were aligned in direct juxtaposition to reactive astrocytes ( Fig. 9E,G ) in an organized and strictly segregated manner to form a long unbroken palisade like border of glial scar ( Figs. 9E,G ) that sharply delineated the central necrotic lesion and intact neural tissue, with the fibromeningeal cells on the inside of the lesion and the astrocytes surrounding these cells on the outside ( Figs. 9A,C,E,G , 10A,C ). In contrast, in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice glial scar formation was severely disrupted; astrocytes near the lesion were dispersed, their processes did not abut and they did not form a contiguous boundary ( Figs. 9B,D,F,H , 10B,D ). Moreover, the arrangement of fibromeningeal cells was also disrupted; they aligned along the disorganized astrocytes with the result that there was no clear border of glial scar ( Figs. 9F,H ) and there was a severe disruption of the boundary between the central necrotic lesion from adjacent intact neural tissue ( Figs. 9B,D,F,H , 10B,D ). It is interesting to note that this disruption of glial scar formation occurred in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice after SCI even though there was no detectable difference in the density of β-galactosidase positive astrocytes in control or GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice either directly along the wound margin ( Fig. 10A-D ) or in the tissue adjacent to the lesion ( Fig. 10E-H ).

We have previously found that transgenically targeted ablation of scar forming reactive astrocytes increased and prolonged inflammatory cell infiltration into neural tissue after CNS injury ( Bush et al., 1999 ; Faulkner et al., 2004 ; Myer et al., 2006 ). Because GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice exhibited marked disruption of astroglia scar formation after SCI, we evaluated the extent and severity of inflammation after SCI in these mice using immunohistochemistry for CD45, a marker for macrophages and microglia, alone or in combination with markers for astrocytes. In control mice at 14 days after SCI, inflammatory cells were largely confined to the central core of the lesion, which contained many large, round, phagocytic macrophages that were clearly separated from surrounding well-preserved tissue that exhibited normally appearing microglia but rare or no phagocytic macrophages ( Figs. 11A,C ). Double staining with GFAP and CD45 showed that inflammatory cells in the central lesion were clearly segregated from the surrounding neural parenchyma by an unbroken palisade of reactive, scar forming astrocytes ( Figs. 11E,G ). In GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice at 14 days after SCI, the central lesion of large phagocytic inflammatory cells was substantially larger than in control mice and the lesion borders were jagged and disrupted so that there was no clear demarcation of the lesion from surrounding tissue and large phagocytic macrophages spread far into the neural parenchyma ( Fig. 11B,D ). This later observation was confirmed by double staining with GFAP and CD45, which showed that in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, inflammatory cells were not contained or restricted by a glial scar but migrated freely among the attenuated and disorganized astrocytes ( Figs. 11F,H ).

To look for potential consequences of the increased inflammation after SCI in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice after moderate crush SCI, we evaluated lesion size and extent of demyelination. In control mice, moderate crush SCI reproducibly caused a small central lesion that was similar in histological appearance and size at 14 and 28 days, with essentially no cavity formation ( Fig. 12A,E ), as described previously by ourselves and others for C57Bl6 mice ( Inman et al., 2002 ; Faulkner et al., 2004 ). GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice exhibited significantly greater lesion volume than controls at both 14 and 28 days ( Fig. 12B,E ), but also exhibited no cavity formation. Control mice regularly exhibited demyelination of white matter in the central lesion, but not of white matter in the lateral columns ( Fig. 12C ). In contrast, GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice consistently exhibited pronounced demyelination also of white matter in the lateral columns ( Fig. 12D ).

To evaluate the effects of GFAP-STAT3-CKO on motor behavior after SCI, we assessed open field and rotorod performance, and conducted footprint analysis. We previously reported that the moderate crush SCI at L1/L2 used here reproducibly causes motor impairments from which non-transgenic mice largely recover over 14 days ( Faulkner et al., 2004 ). In the present study, in uninjured mice we found no detectable differences between the motor performances of control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice in all three of the tests used ( Fig. 13 ). In addition, in a manner similar to our previous studies, we found that control mice exhibited significant impairments in all three motor tests at 3 days after moderate crush SCI, from which they exhibited a gradual and substantial recovery in all three measures of motor function and reached a plateau just below pre-injury levels at about 14 days after SCI ( Fig. 13 ). GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice exhibited somewhat greater levels of impairments in all three motor tests at 3 days after SCI, and also improved with time after SCI. Nevertheless, in spite of their improvements over time, GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice had moderately but significantly lower scores in all three tests of motor function at all times as compared with controls and with pre-injury levels ( Fig. 13 ). All mice initially lost bladder function after SCI and required manual bladder expression for at least the first 3 days. Bladder function recovered thereafter at roughly similar rates and to roughly similar degrees in control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, such that bladder function (defined as not requiring manual bladder expression) had returned by 10 days after SCI in 83% of control mice and 70% of GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice and was similar in both groups (>90%) at the time of perfusion at 14 or 28 days.

## Discussion
STAT3 is a signal transducer of various cytokines and growth factors including IL-6, Il-10, EGF, TGFα LIF and CNTF, which are important in intercellular signaling after CNS injury. In this study we found that conditional deletion of STAT3 from GFAP-expressing cells had little detectable effect on the development of astrocytes, but significantly attenuated astrocyte activation after SCI. Our findings show that STAT3 is a critical regulator of certain aspects of reactive astrogliosis, in particular the up-regulation of intermediate filaments, astrocyte hypertrophy and glial scar formation. Our findings also provide evidence that scar-forming astrocytes restrict the spread of inflammatory cells and help to preserve functional tissue after SCI.

We extensively characterized our transgenic mouse model for specificity and efficacy of conditional deletion of STAT3 from astrocytes. While transgenic targeting is stable within transgenic breeding lines ( Feng et al., 2000 ), every transgenic line exhibits its own specific pattern of targeting and requires detailed characterization at the single cell level for every population of cells studied. We used transgenic GFAP-Cre mice of line 73.12 generated previously using the entire mouse GFAP promoter and characterized in forebrain ( Garcia et al., 2004 ). Additional characterization of line 73.12 here showed that Cre expression closely mimicked endogenous GFAP in spinal cord. Cre activity, as revealed by reporter gene expression, was confined to molecularly and morphologically identified astrocytes, and Cre activity was selectively targeted to essentially all reactive astrocytes after SCI. Together these findings indicate that these mice comprise an appropriate targeting model for evaluating effects of conditional gene deletion from astrocytes in SCI. Using the 73.12 GFAP-Cre line we generated GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice and demonstrated effective STAT3 deletion.

Jak-STAT signaling through STAT1 and STAT3 has been implicated in astrocyte development ( Bonni et al., 1997 ; He et al., 2005 ). In vitro studies suggest that commitment of progenitors to astrogliogenesis precedes GFAP expression ( Mi and Barres, 1999 ), in which case Cre expression and STAT3 deletion in our GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice would occur after STAT3 has acted on progenitors to induce astrogliogenesis. We carefully examined CNS architecture and the appearance of astrocytes in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Gross structure and CNS cytoarchitecture revealed by nissl and myelin stains were indistinguishable in uninjured control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Quantitative stereological analysis showed that the density and size of astrocytes were identical in uninjured controls and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Reporter labeled astrocytes were indistinguishable in appearance in uninjured control and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Astrocytes from GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice expressed reduced levels of GFAP and we cannot rule some level of consequent structural changes that might be revealed by more detailed evaluations, for example with single cell dye filling ( Bushong et al., 2002 ; Nedergaard et al., 2003 ). Nevertheless, there were no detectable differences in three motor tests in uninjured controls and GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice. Together these findings indicate that STAT3-CKO in our model did not detectably disrupt astrocyte development or function in uninjured mice. It is also noteworthy that although STAT3 is present in uninjured spinal cord we found no detectable activated pSTAT3 in astrocytes in uninjured mice, and that pSTAT3 signaling appears primarily to be activated in response to insults such as traumatic SCI, as seen here and in other studies ( Yamauchi et al., 2006 ). These observations further support the validity of our transgenic strategy.

The hallmarks of reactive astrogliosis after SCI include a pronounced increase in expression of intermediate filament proteins and cellular hypertrophy that occurs over the first few days, along with scar formation by the end of two weeks ( Norton et al., 1992 ; Amat et al., 1996 ). We found that pSTAT3 is activated specifically in astrocytes over the first several days after SCI and has largely subsided by 7 to 14 days after SCI. In addition, many other cells, including neurons exhibit activated pSTAT3 after SCI and many of these remain activated at 14 days after SCI, highlighting the need to conduct single cell analyses and to document that conditional deletion is targeted to specific cell types to study to roles of pSTAT3 signaling selectively in those cell types after SCI in vivo . After SCI in our GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, astrocytes exhibited a markedly attenuated, but not entirely absent, increase in expression of the intermediate filaments, GFAP and vimentin, as well as a failure to undergo cellular hypertrophy. These events may be related. Intermediate filaments are structural proteins ( Eng et al., 2000 ) and astrocytes exhibit attenuated hypertrophy after forebrain injury in mice with global deletion of GFAP and vimentin ( Wilhelmsson et al., 2004 ). It is also noteworthy that signaling pathways other than Jak-STAT are involved in regulating GFAP expression and astrogliosis ( Shafit-Zagardo et al., 1988 ; Gadea et al., 2008 ), and that signaling through these pathways are likely to be responsible for the small up regulation in GFAP noted after SCI in our GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice.

Contribution to multicellular glial scar formation is a prominent feature of reactive astrocytes after SCI ( Reier and Houle, 1988 ; Silver and Miller, 2004 ) and in normal mice, astrocytes and fibroblasts interact to form a clearly delineated and highly aligned border of cells with interlocking processes that surround the lesion and delineate damaged and viable tissue ( Bundesen et al., 2003 ), as noted also in our control mice. In contrast, after SCI in GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, we found that astrocytes were distributed randomly in the vicinity of the lesion, that the cells did not align and processes did not interlock along the wound margin, that alignment with fibroblasts did not occur, and that there were no clearly delineated borders between necrotic tissue and adjacent neural parenchyma. While there was no detectable difference in the density of astrocytes in the vicinity of the lesion in control or GFAP-STAT3-CKO mice, the STAT3 deficient astrocytes had failed to hypertrophy and did not exhibit the robust extension of processes noted in control mice. A variety of previous studies have indicated that (i) cytokines that signal through STAT3 are up regulated after SCI ( Balasingam et al., 1994 ; Winter et al., 1995 ; Klein et al., 1997 ; Rabchevsky et al., 1998 ; Levison et al., 2000 ; Albrecht et al., 2002 ; Nakamura et al., 2003 ), (ii) tissue levels of pSTAT3 levels increase after SCI ( Yamauchi et al., 2006 ) and (iii) broad deletion of STAT3 from neural cells using a nestin-cre transgenic model increases lesion size and attenuates recovery after SCI ( Okada et al., 2006 ). Our findings are consistent with and extend these observations by providing direct mechanistic evidence in vivo that pSTAT3 signaling acting specifically in astrocytes is essential for certain cellular hallmarks of astrogliosis, including up regulation of intermediate filament proteins, cellular hypertrophy, and formation of a structurally organized glial scar.

Astrocytes exert many activities essential to normal CNS function ( Kettenmann and Ransom, 2004 ; Christopherson et al., 2005 ; Gensert and Ratan, 2006 ; Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007 ; Pellerin et al., 2007 ). Understanding changes in molecular signaling that occur during reactive astrogliosis may shed light on beneficial as well as detrimental consequences of reactive astrogliosis after CNS insults such as SCI ( Sofroniew, 2005 ), and knowledge of specific functions mediated by specific signaling mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. We have previously hypothesized that one beneficial role of astrocyte scar formation is to prevent the migration of activated inflammatory cells away from the lesion site into closely adjacent potentially viable neural tissue, based on transgenically targeted astrocyte ablation studies ( Bush et al., 1999 ; Faulkner et al., 2004 ; Sofroniew, 2005 ; Myer et al., 2006 ). Our observations here are consistent with and extend this hypothesis by showing that STAT3 signaling in astrocytes is important in regulating scar formation and that disrupted scar formation exacerbates inflammation after SCI. Similar observations of increased inflammation have recently been reported using related models of transgenically targeted attenuation of reactive astrogliosis after SCI or stroke ( Okada et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2008 ). These findings are in line with observations that auto-antibodies against an astrocyte protein, AQP4, are associated both with destruction of astrocyte endfeet and autoimmune CNS inflammation in patients with neuromyelitis optica ( Lennon et al., 2005 ). Nevertheless, it is important to note that while reactive astrocyte activities can in some cases be associated with restricting inflammation, limiting lesion size and preserving function ( Sofroniew, 2005 ; Maragakis and Rothstein, 2006 ; Li et al., 2008 ), astrocytes also respond to signaling pathways involved in pro-inflammatory activation ( John et al., 2003 ), such as the nfκb pathway ( Brambilla et al., 2005 ), and that some reactive astrocyte activities may have pro-inflammatory effects or cause tissue damage, such as production of reactive oxygen or cytotoxic edema ( Murphy et al., 1993 ; Agullo et al., 1995 ; Neufeld and Liu, 2003 ; Antony et al., 2004 ; Okada et al., 2006 ). Taken together, current evidence thus suggests that different potential effects of reactive astrogliosis on overall outcome after CNS insults are likely to be context dependent and regulated by different intracellular signaling pathways. This raises the possibility that different reactive astrocyte activities can be manipulated separately by exogenous interventions. Our study provides direct evidence that pSTAT3 signaling in astrocytes in vivo regulates aspects of astrogliosis that are essential for restricting inflammation and lesion size, thereby preserving functional tissue after SCI. This transgenic strategy will also be useful to dissect the regulation of other roles of reactive astrocytes.
