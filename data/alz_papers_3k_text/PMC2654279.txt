SRF and myocardin regulate LRP-mediated amyloid-β clearance in brain vascular cells

# Abstract
Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) deposition in cerebral vessels contributes to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we report that in AD patients and two mouse models of AD, overexpression of serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin (MYOCD) in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) generates an Aβ non-clearing VSMC phenotype through transactivation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, which downregulates low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1, a key Aβ clearance receptor. Hypoxia stimulated SRF/MYOCD expression in human cerebral VSMCs and in animal models of AD. We suggest that SRF and MYOCD function as a transcriptional switch, controlling Aβ cerebrovascular clearance and progression of AD.

## RESULTS
SRF and MYOCD are overexpressed in cerebral VSMCs in AD patients with CAA 22 . Western blot analysis of small cerebral leptomeningeal arterial blood vessel homogenates from AD individuals with CAA showed elevated levels of SRF and MYOCD, Aβ accumulation and significantly lower levels of LRP, compared with age-matched, non-demented controls without CAA (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a–c). As Aβ does not influence SRF and MYOCD expression in VSMCs 22 , we hypothesized that if the association between Aβ accumulation in the vessel wall and SRF/MYOCD overexpression in cerebral VSMCs in AD was not due to chance, then overexpression of SRF and MYOCD may influence clearance of Aβ from VSMCs. To test this hypothesis, we compared clearance of Cy3-labelled Aβ aggregates by cultured cerebral VSMCs isolated from small intracerebral and leptomeningeal arteries from late-stage AD individuals with CAA and age-matched controls without CAA, using a model similar to that reported for Aβ clearance by cultured astrocytes 26 . In all studies, VSMCs were early first-passage cells. (see Methods and Supplementary Information, Table S1 for clinical and neuropathological characteristics of AD individuals and controls). Compared with control VSMCs, AD VSMC showed a decrease in Aβ clearance of more than 70% ( Fig. 1a, e ), and expressed consistently higher levels of SRF and MYOCD ( Fig. 1d ), as reported previously 22 , and significantly lower levels of LRP ( Fig. 2b ). Thus, changes in SRF, MYOCD and LRP expression in cultured cerebral VSMCs from AD cases, compared with controls, correlated well with changes in their respective expression levels in cerebral pial arteries in brains in situ (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a–c).

To address whether reducing SRF expression improves Aβ clearance in cerebral VSMCs in AD, we silenced SRF by adenoviral-mediated transduction of AD VSMCs with a short hairpin RNA against SRF (Ad.sh SRF; moi 100). This decreased levels of both SRF and MYOCD to approximately their respective levels found in controls ( Fig. 1d ). In some experiments, lower-molecular-weight SRF species, corresponding to spliced or cleaved SRF (data not shown) were also present, as reported for human VSMCs 22 . Reduced MYOCD levels are consistent with earlier reports showing that silencing SRF in VSMCs results in downregulation of MYOCD 22 and that its expression is sharply reduced in Srf -null mice 27 – 29 . Ad.sh SRF , but not control sh GFP ( Fig. 1d ), substantially improved Aβ clearance by AD VSMCs ( Fig. 1b, e ). These data indicate that SRF overexpression in cerebral VSMCs from AD individuals decreases Aβ clearance.

Next, we transduced control human cerebral VSMCs with Ad. MYOCD to determine whether overexpression of MYOCD would generate an AD-like, Aβ non-clearing phenotype. MYOCD gene transfer upregulated both MYOCD and SRF ( Fig. 1d ) and decreased Aβ clearance by 65% ( Fig. 1c, e ). MYOCD upregulated SRF, as reported previously 22 , by augmenting SRF promoter activity, most likely in a CArG-dependent manner (data not shown). Findings from 8 AD cases and 7 controls are summarized in Fig. 1e . Clearance of Cy3-labelled Aβ40 was also reduced in AD VSMCs, compared with controls ( Fig. 1f ). MYOCD , but not GFP , gene transfer to control VSMCs decreased Aβ40 clearance by more than 100% ( Fig. 1f ). These findings demonstrate that MYOCD and SRF overexpression in normal human cerebral VSMC phenocopies the Aβ non-clearing AD-like phenotype.

As LRP, a key Aβ clearance receptor, is downregulated in AD cerebral vessels in situ 12 , 14 , 30 (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a, c), we next studied whether alterations in SRF and MYOCD expression in cerebral VSMCs affect LRP- mediated Aβ clearance. First, we showed that, in contrast to wild-type embryonic mouse fibroblasts ( Lrp +/+ ), Lrp −/− fibroblasts cannot clear Aβ aggregates, confirming the requirement of LRP for Aβ clearance (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1d). Aβ clearance in human cerebral VSMCs was inhibited by the receptor associated protein (RAP), which inhibits binding of Aβ and other LRP ligands to LRP 12 , by LRP silencing with Ad.sh LRP or by an LRP-specific blocking antibody (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1e). Transduction of VSMCs with control Ad.sh GFP did not alter LRP expression. In VSMCs transduced with Ad.sh LRP , the addition of RAP abolished Aβ clearance (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1e).

Figure 2a (left panel) illustrates internalization of Aβ aggregates by control VSMCs and their colocalization with lysosomes. As expected, RAP (data not shown) or an LRP-specific antibody inhibited Aβ internalization and its lysosomal association ( Fig. 2a , right), confirming that LRP is essential for both steps. LRP levels were significantly reduced in cultured AD VSMCs, compared with controls( P < 0.05, Fig. 2b ), corroborating in vivo findings 12 , 30 , 31 (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a, c). Ad.sh SRF , but not Ad.sh GFP , normalized LRP expression in AD VSMCs ( Fig. 2b ) and significantly increased Aβ clearance ( Fig. 1b, e ). Increased LRP protein level was accompanied by increased LRP mRNA levels of more than 4-fold ( Fig. 2c ). In contrast, MYOCD overexpression in control VSMCs significantly reduced LRP protein levels ( P < 0.01, Fig. 2d ) and LRP mRNA transcripts by more than 80% ( Fig. 2e ), resulting in decreased Aβ clearance ( Fig. 1c, e ). Taken together, these data suggest that SRF and MYOCD control the Aβ clearance phenotype in VSMCs by regulating LRP expression at the transcriptional level.

To delineate the molecular nature of SRF–MYOCD-mediated LRP suppression, we focused on SREBP2 23 because it is the only known transcriptional suppressor of LRP 24 , 25 . The human SREBP2 promoter and intron 1 contain one and two CArG elements, respectively ( Fig. 3a ). MYOCD and SRF had no significant effect on the SREBP2 promoter alone, but they activated it in the presence of intron 1 sequences in cultured VSMCs. Moreover, mutation of both CArG boxes in the intron 1 sequence ablated SRF and MYOCD activation of SREBP2 ( Fig. 3a ), suggesting that the observed activation of SREBP2 is CArG-dependent.

Next we studied whether increased SRF/MYOCD expression in cerebral VSMCs derived from AD individuals with CAA is associated with SREBP2 activation. We found that nuclear levels of SREBP2 are elevated in AD VSMC, compared with age-matched control VSMCs, which correlates with reduced LRP cellular expression, compared with controls ( Fig. 3b versus d ). Increased SREBP2 nuclear expression and decreased LRP expression in cultured cerebral VSMCs from AD patients with CAA were consistent with findings demonstrating increased SREBP2 nuclear expression and reduced LRP expression in cerebral VSMC in AD leptomeningeal vessels in situ , relative to controls (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1f, g).

Nuclear levels of SREBP2 were downregulated and LRP levels increased in AD VSMC transduced with Ad.sh SRF , but not with Ad.sh GFP ( Fig. 3b ), as one would expect with removal of the LRP transcriptional suppressor 24 , 25 . Quantification of nuclear SREBP2 signal intensity and LRP cellular signal intensity after Ad.sh SRF transduction confirmed significant reductions in nuclear SREBP2 and increases in LRP expression (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a). Western blot analysis confirmed that levels of both SREBP2 cytoplasmic long form and short nuclear form were reduced, and LRP expression increased in AD VSMC transduced with Ad.sh SRF , compared with Ad.sh GFP cells ( Fig. 3c ).

As expected, overexpression of MYOCD in control VSMCs upregulated SREBP2 long form, followed by increases in the level of SREBP2 short nuclear form and decreases in LRP cellular levels ( Fig. 3d ; Supplementary Information, Fig. S2b). This was confirmed by western blot analysis ( Fig. 3e ). Consistent with increased SREBP2 transcriptional activity, there was an increase in the expression of other SREBP2 target genes 23 , such as LDLR (data not shown). Overexpression of MYOCD significantly upregulated SRF levels ( Fig 1d , Fig 3e ). To establish that MYOCD and SRF regulate LRP through SREBP2, we studied LRP expression in control VSMCs transduced with Ad. MYOCD and co-transfected with a short interfering RNA against SREBP2 ( SREBP2 siRNA) or a control siRNA (si CNTRL ), which does not cause specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA. VSMCs expressing si CNTRL and Ad. MYOCD , but not Ad. GFP , showed increased levels of SREBP2 precursor cytoplasmic form and its active form, and reduced LRP levels ( Fig. 3f ). In contrast, silencing SREBP2 with si SREBP2 resulted in loss of LRP suppression after Ad. MYOCD gene transfer ( Fig. 3f ). Silencing SREBP2, but not si CNTRL , prevented loss of LRP mRNA levels after Ad. MYOCD gene transfer ( Fig. 3g ). These data indicate that downregulation of LRP by SRF and MYOCD requires an intermediate step, namely SRF–MYOCD transactivation of SREBP2.

We next asked whether altering Srf and Myocd expression in cerebral VSMCs in vivo influences Aβ accumulation in vessels and focally in the brain of control mice and in mouse models of AD. As genetic inactivation of Myocd or Srf is embryonic lethal 27 , 32 and Srf overexpression results in severe cardiac abnormalities and death 33 , we used adenoviral-mediated MYOCD or sh SRF gene transfer to mouse pial cerebral arteries using a subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid perfusion technique 22 . Levels of MYOCD and SRF levels were higher in cerebral VSMCs in situ isolated from the sites of transduction with Ad. MYOCD , compared with Ad. GFP ( Fig. 4a, b ). MYOCD-transduced vessels expressed increased levels of VSMC-specific genes, for example, smooth muscle α-actin and calponin ( Fig. 4a, b ), as reported previously 22 , demonstrating effective MYOCD gene transfer into the VSMC layer. Vessels transduced with Ad. MYOCD expressed 2.2-fold higher levels of the long form of SREBP2 and 90% lower levels of LRP, compared with GFP controls ( Fig. 4a, b ). Nuclear localization of SREBP2 and substantial downregulation of LRP after MYOCD in vivo gene transfer to pial vessels were confirmed by immunocytochemical staining ( Fig. 4c ). Moreover, MYOCD gene transfer increased levels of mouse endogenous Aβ42 in transduced subarachnoid pial vessels and focally in brain tissue by 3-fold and 70%, respectively ( Fig. 4d, e ), demonstrating an inhibition of Aβ clearance in vivo . Aβ40 levels were similarly increased (data not shown).

Next, we tested our hypothesis in a mouse model of CAA expressing the Dutch and Iowa vasculotropic APP mutations 11 and in the APPsw ± mice, which develop significant CAA after 12 months of age 34 . The Dutch/Iowa mice accumulate Aβ in the brain earlier than APPsw ± mice in spite of extremely low-level expression of human APP mutant in the brain 11 . In these mice Aβ clearance across the BBB is non-functional, leaving the perivascular arterial route as a key mechanism for Aβ drainage 12 . As cerebral VSMCs contribute to Aβ elimination during its drainage along the perivascular arterial route 2 , we hypothesized that silencing Srf in neocortical pial arteries may improve focal Aβ clearance. Local transduction of cerebral pial vessels with Ad.sh SRF , compared with Ad.sh GFP , in 24-month-old Dutch/Iowa APP mice significantly reduced Aβ load in the transduced vessels area as well as focally in the underlying brain tissue, and decreased total amyloid load and Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels focally in brain ( Fig. 5a–e ). SREBP2 cytoplasmic and nuclear forms were downregulated more than 2.5-fold, and the relative abundance of immature LRP-600 and mature LRP-85 bands increased by about 4-fold in pial vessels transduced with Ad.sh SRF , compared with Ad.sh GFP vessels ( Fig. 5f ), suggesting increased de novo synthesis of LRP. These findings corroborated our findings in cultured human cerebral VSMCs ( Fig. 2 ). Moreover, Ad.sh SRF transfer to pial vessels in 16-month-old APPsw ± mice, compared with Ad.sh GFP controls resulted in a significant reduction of Aβ cerebrovascular load as demonstrated by a 5-day longitudinal 2-photon in vivo imaging of the cortical lamina I–III with methoxy-XO4 for amyloid and Texas Red dextran angiography ( Fig. 5g ). Aβ40 and 42 levels were also significantly reduced in the brain areas containing pial vessels transduced with Ad.sh SRF , compared with Ad.sh GFP ( Fig. 5h ). These findings suggest that Srf silencing in cerebral blood vessels increases local Aβ clearance in vivo and attenuates CAA in two models of familial AD, presumably by normalizing SREBP2 levels and alleviating the transcriptional brake on LRP expression.

In contrast, MYOCD gene transfer to pial cerebral vessels in 15-month-old Dutch/Iowa APP -expressing mice substantially increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels and Aβ load in the transduced vessel area and focally in brain tissue ( Fig. 6a–c ). Exacerbation of CAA was confirmed by thioflavin S-positive staining for fibrillar amyloid ( Fig. 6d ). MYOCD gene transfer significantly increased the levels of MYOCD and SRF (data not shown) and SREBP2 in transduced vessels, eliminated the mature LRP-85 band and reduced the levels of immature LRP-600 by more than 50% 12 ( Fig. 6e ). Transcriptional activity of SREBP2 was confirmed by increased expression of LDLR (data not shown), one of the SREBP2 target genes 23 . These data suggest that MYOCD and SRF activate SREBP2, and repress de novo synthesis of LRP in cerebral vessels in vivo , similarly to that as shown in human cerebral VSMCs in vitro ( Fig. 2 ). We also showed that MYOCD gene transfer to neocortical pial vessels in 16-month-old APPsw ± mice significantly ( P < 0.01) increased Aβ40 and 42 levels, Aβ load and thioflavin S staining in pial arteries, Aβ40 and 42 levels, and Aβ load focally in brain (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3).

Neither oxidant stress nor Aβ accumulation are upstream of SRF and MYOCD 22 . Low levels of the mesenchyme homeobox gene-2 ( MEOX-2 ) decrease LRP in brain endothelium of AD individuals 31 , but MEOX-2 does not regulate SRF/MYOCD in cerebral VSMCs 22 . Thus, we focused on our pilot observation suggesting that hypoxia increases MYOCD mRNA levels in VSMCs 22 . Cerebral hypoperfusion is a recurring feature in vascular and AD dementias, and hypoxia is a local cellular consequence of such reduced cerebral blood flow. Hypoxia ( Fig. 7a ) and/or co-transfection of normoxic VSMCs with the hypoxia-inducing factor-1α (HIF-1α; Fig. 7b ), increased a MYOCD-driven luciferase promoter. Importantly, deletion of the hypoxia response element (HRE) abolished both hypoxia- and HIF-1α-induced MYOCD promoter activity ( Fig. 7a, b ). In cultured human VSMCs, hypoxia significantly increased MYOCD mRNA levels ( Fig. 7c ) and MYOCD and SRF protein levels by 6-fold, but reduced LRP expression ( Fig. 7d ). Consistent with these findings we found an increase in nuclear SREBP2 levels associated with decreased LRP expression when VSMCs were exposed to hypoxia ( Fig. 7e ). We then subjected 5–6-month-old APPsw ± mice to a hypoxia chamber (10% to 8% oxygen) for 2 weeks and found a significant increase in MYOCD and SRF levels in the pial blood vessels, as well as increased nuclear levels of SREBP2 and decreased LRP levels ( Fig. 7f ). Hypoxia increased the MYOCD mRNA levels by about 6-fold and reduced LRP mRNA levels by more than 60% ( Fig. 7g ). These changes in the molecular profile of pial vessels in APPsw ± mice exposed to hypoxia were accompanied by increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in these vessels, compared with normoxic control APPsw ± mice ( Fig. 7h ). Silencing SRF resulted in normalization of Aβ cerebrovascular clearance (data not shown). Collectively, these findings provide the first molecular insight into how MYOCD gene regulation may occur in a pathophysiological setting and suggest that hypoxia represents a key environmental stimulus for AD VSMC-associated increases in SRF–MYOCD and the attending hypercontractility 22 and faulty Aβ clearance.

## DISCUSSION
In this report, we advance the concept that SRF and MYOCD overexpression in cerebral VSMC may contribute to neurovascular dysfunction and dementia in AD by inducing a hypercontractile phenotype in small cerebral arteries, resulting in reduced cerebral blood flow 22 , and by promoting an Aβ non-clearing VSMC phenotype through directed expression of SREBP2, which suppresses LRP, a key Aβ clearance receptor, resulting in the development of CAA and multifocal brain Aβ accumulations ( Fig. 8a, b ).

New roles for SRF and MYOCD have been described recently. MYOCD acts as a potent repressor of MyoD-mediated skeletal muscle cell differentiation in an SRF-CArG element independent manner 35 . SRF regulates neuronal migration and axon guidance 36 and learning 37 . The present study demonstrates that MYOCD and SRF mediate a CArG-dependent transcriptional switch in the cerebral VSMCs, controlling CAA and brain clearance of Aβ. This transcriptional switch needs both MYOCD and SRF and is unique to cerebral VSMCs, as MYOCD has not been found in brain endothelial cells or astrocytes and/or neuronal lineages.

The role of LRP as an Aβ clearance receptor on VSMC, as shown in the present study, is consistent with its reported role as an endocytic cargo receptor 38 . Impaired LRP-mediated clearance of Aβ in VSMCs in AD and AD models is consistent with reports demonstrating diminished LRP-mediated Aβ clearance at the BBB in AD and AD models 12 , 14 , 17 , 30 , 39 . In addition, soluble LRP in plasma provides a key endogenous peripheral ‘sink’ for Aβ in humans, which is impaired in AD 40 .

SREBP2 negatively regulates LRP expression by binding to the sterol responsive element 1 site on the LRP gene 24 . SREBP2 is important in cholesterol homeostasis because it is specific for cholesterogenic genes 23 . By downregulating LRP, SREBP2 prevents LRP-mediated accumulation of intracellular cholesterol esters in macrophages and VSMCs 25 . Curiously, small pial and intracerebral arteries in AD do not accumulate aggregated LDL and cholesterol esters or develop atherosclerosis 1 , 2 possibly due to downregulated LRP 25 . Earlier work with truncated versions of SREBPs has shown that when cells express these truncated proteins the SREBP-dependent genes cannot be suppressed by sterols 41 , 42 . Similarly, in the presence of SRF–MYOCD-directed expression of SREBP2 in VSMCs, changes in sterol levels would not be expected to influence SREBP2 and/or SREBP2-dependent LRP expression.

Previous studies have shown that people chronically treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins, are less prone to develop AD 43 , 44 . We reported that statins can increase LRP expression in vascular cells in the presence of Aβ 45 , suggesting that LRP can escape SREBP2-mediated repression through a mechanism(s) outside the sterol-SREBP2 axis. On the basis of the present findings, it is likely that statins, particularly those that do not cross the BBB, may produce beneficial effects in AD, primarily through their action on blood vessels and improvement of brain perfusion rather than by directly affecting cholesterol levels in the brain, to reduce Aβ production through the cholesterol-mediated pathway 46 and/or blockade of isoprenoid-mediated pathway 47 . It is also possible that organization of cerebral vessels in certain brain areas contributes to spatial restriction of amyloid accumulation in AD, preferentially affecting some areas, such as the entorhinal cortex.

Brains of AD patients are chronically hypoperfused and exposed to hypoxia 1 , 2 , 48 , 49 . Our findings in hypoxic cerebral VSMCs and in APPsw ± mice subjected to hypoxia raise the possibility that hypoxia may be an initial stimulus for MYOCD upregulation and subsequent elevations in SRF in VSMC of AD patients and models. This is consistent with earlier reports suggesting that hypoxia increases the levels of MYOCD mRNA in cultured VSMC 22 , 50 . Thus, hypoxia can set in motion the SRF–MYOCD pathogenic pathway in AD specifically in VSMCs by upregulating MYOCD, whose expression in brain is restricted to VSMCs. Such increases in MYOCD may activate SRF, whose promoter region is controlled by two CArG elements 19 .

In summary, we suggest that elevated SRF and MYOCD activity enhances Aβ accumulation in the vessel wall and this may initiate the development of CAA, focal Aβ brain accumulations, cerebral arterial hypoperfusion and neurovascular uncoupling, commonly seen in AD. Thus, SRF and MYOCD could be therapeutic targets for CAA associated with cognitive decline and impaired clearance of Aβ from the brain.

## METHODS
Cerebral VSMCs were isolated from small intracerebral and leptomeningeal arteries (Brodmann’s areas 9/10) from late-stage AD individuals with CAA and non-demented age-matched controls with little or no pathology and without CAA. For clinical and neuropathological characteristics see Supplementary Information, Table S1.

Pial arterial VSMCs were isolated and characterized as reported previously 22 . We used primary early passage 1 VSMCs.

Adenoviral sh SRF and MYOCD gene constructs were as we previously reported 22 .

The LRP RNAi gene construct was cloned into the BLOCK iT U6 RNAi expression entry vector.

This was performed as reported previously 22 .

The multi-spot glass slides were coated with Cy3-labelled Aβ42 or Aβ40 (ref. 26 ) at 5^µg per spot without cells, with control cerebral VSMCs or AD VSMCs, AD VSMCs transduced with Ad.sh SRF or Ad.sh GFP , or control VSMCs transduced with Ad. MYOCD or Ad. GFP . Cells (2,500 per spot) were incubated for 5 days in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were labelled with Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (Invitrogen C7025) and Lysotracker Blue DND-22 then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were scanned using a Zeiss 510 meta multi-photon/confocal microscope with a 543 nm HeNe laser to detect Cy3-Aβ42, a 488 nm Argon laser to detect Cell Tracker Green and an 800-nm tuned Ti:sapphire Laser (Mai Tai Spectra Physics) to detect Lyostracker Blue. Twenty randomly chosen spots per slide from 3–4 independent cultures per group were analysed. The relative Cy3 signal intensity was measured with the NIH Image J software.

QPCR was performed using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) and the Stratagene MX3005P QPCR system.

We cloned from HeLa genomic DNA the human SREBP2 promoter (1,375 bp encompassing one CArG element) and intron 1 sequences (1,315 bp encompassing 2 CArG elements) for responsiveness to SRF/MYOCD. Following sequence validation, we cloned the SREBP2 promoter into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) either alone or in combination with the intronic sequence. Mutations in the SREBP2 CArG elements were performed with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) where the first 3 nucleotides of the CArG element were changed to GTC. Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized to a control (Renilla) vector.

Control siRNA (si CNTRL , Santa Cruz, sc-37007) or SREBP2 siRNA (sc-36559) were transfected into cultured VSMCs using Metafectene (Biontex) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Expression of SRF, MYOCD, SREBP2 and LRP was studied by western blot analysis in human cerebral VSMCs and small cerebral leptomenigeal arteries (Brodmann’s areas 9/10) derived from AD patients with CAA and controls. VSMC samples were washed in cold phosphate buffer saline and lysed with a RIPA buffer. Small cerebral arteries samples were additionally sonicated in the RIPA buffer. Proteins were quantified with a protein assay kit (Pierce).

AD VSMCs infected with Ad.sh GFP or Ad.sh SRF or control VSMCs infected with Ad. LacZ or Ad. MYOCD were cultured for 48 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells and human brain sections (Brodmann’s area 9/10) were then stained using a rabbit anti-human SREBP2 antibody (Abcam, ab30682) and mouse anti-human LRP (Calbiochem, 438192) followed by incubation with secondary antibodies, such as FITC-conjugated goat and rabbit, CY3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse and TO-PRO3, a fluorescent nuclear marker (Invitrogen). Cells and tissue were scanned using a Zeiss 510 meta multi-photon/confocal microscope with a 543-nm HeNe laser to detect Cy3, a 488-nm Argon laser to detect FITC, a 633-nm HeNe laser to detect TO-PRO3, and an 800-nm tuned Ti:sapphire Laser (Mai Tai Spectra Physics) to detect methoxy-X04.

We cloned the mouse Myocd promoter from genomic DNA with or without the conserved hypoxia response element (HRE). Following sequence validation, we cloned the MYOCD promoters into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). PAC1 VSMC were transfected with luciferase reporters, then incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS under normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions, or co-transfected with either control or HIF1α expression plasmid construct (gift from Gregg Semenza, Johns Hopkins, MD). Human control VSMCs were incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS under either normoxic (21% O 2 ) or hypoxic (1% O 2 ) conditions.

Dutch/Iowa APP transgenic mice 11 at 24 months of age and APPsw ± mice 34 at 16 months of age were used to silence Srf . Dutch/Iowa APP 11 at 15 months of age and APPsw ± mice at 16 months of age were used to overexpress Myocd . All procedures with animals have been preformed using an approved institutional protocol according to the NIH guidelines.

This procedure was performed as we reported previously 22 .

We determined endogenous Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the vessels and focally in brain tissue in control mice by a sandwich ELISA, as reported previously 40 .

The levels of human Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the Dutch/Iowa APP mice and APPsw ± mice were determined using ELISA kits KHB3481 and KHB3441, respectively (Biosource), as we reported previously 40 . In all studies, Aβ levels were determined focally in brain parenchyma.

Cyrostat sections (10 µm) were stained using polyclonal anti-pan Aβ (1:200; Invitrogen, 44–136) and polyclonal anti-mouse CD31 (1:200; BD Pharmingen, 550274). Fluorescence imaging was obtained using fluorescein goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen, F-2765) and Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rat IgG (1:200; Invitrogen, A-21209).

Sections were incubated in 0.5% thioflavin S in 70% ethanol for 5 min and washed with distilled water.

Vessels were washed with PBS and lysed with a buffer as above. MYOCD, SRF, SREBP2, LRP and β-actin were detected using the primary antibodies as described above. Primary antibodies for SM-calponin (1:10,000, hCP, Sigma) and SM α-actin (1:1,000, Sigma, A-2547) were also used. Quantification was performed by densitometry analysis using a AlphaImager 2200 and AlphaEase FC software (Alpha Innotech Corporation).

Five days after GFP or MYOCD gene transfer, 10-µm frozen sections of brain were stained for SREBP2 nuclear localization and LRP as described above.

We performed a longitudinal 5-day multiphoton in vivo imaging of vascular amyloid in 16-month-old APPsw ± mice transduced with Ad.sh SRF or Ad.sh GFP . Imaging was perfomed on the day of transduction and 5 days after transduction. One day before imaging, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg kg −1 methoxy-X04 (Neuroptix). For imaging, mice were anaesthetized with urethane (750 mg kg −1 , i.p.) and chloralose (50 mg kg −1 , i.p.). Texas Red conjugated Dextran (70K; 200 mg kg −1 ) was injected into the tail vein to create a fluorescent angiogram. In vivo images were acquired using a Zeiss 5MP multi-photon microscope coupled to a 900-nm mode locked Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics). Quantification of residual X-04 fluorescence was analysed using NIH Image J software.

We used a normobaric chamber with 10% oxygen on the first day, 9% on the second day, and then 8% of oxygen for up to 2 weeks, as we described previously 31 .

ANOVA was used to determine statistically significant differences. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
