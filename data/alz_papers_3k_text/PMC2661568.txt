Hippocampal and Cognitive Aging across the Lifespan: A Bioenergetic Shift Precedes and Increased Cholesterol Trafficking Parallels Memory Impairment

# Abstract
Multiple hippocampal processes and cognitive functions change with aging or Alzheimer’s disease, but the potential triggers of these aging cascades are not well understood. Here, we quantified hippocampal expression profiles and behavior across the adult lifespan, to identify early aging changes and changes that coincide with subsequent onset of cognitive impairment. Well-powered microarray analyses (N=49 arrays), immunohistochemistry and Morris spatial maze learning were used to study male F344 rats at 5 age points. Genes that changed with aging (by ANOVA) were assigned to one-of-four onset-age ranges based upon template pattern matching; functional pathways represented by these genes were identified statistically (Genome Ontology). In the earliest onset-age range (3–6 months-old), upregulation began for genes in lipid/protein catabolic and lysosomal pathways, indicating a shift in metabolic substrates, whereas downregulation began for lipid synthesis, GTP/ATP-dependent signaling and neural development genes. By 6–9 months-of-age, upregulation of immune/inflammatory cytokines was pronounced. Cognitive impairment first appeared in the Midlife range (9–12 months), and coincided and correlated primarily with midlife upregulation of genes associated with cholesterol trafficking (apolipoprotein E), myelinogenic and proteolytic/MHC antigen-presenting pathways. Immunolabeling revealed that cholesterol trafficking proteins were substantially increased in astrocytes, and that myelination increased with aging. Together, our data suggest a novel sequential model in which an early-adult metabolic shift, favoring lipid/ketone body oxidation, triggers inflammatory degradation of myelin and resultant excess cholesterol that, by midlife, activates cholesterol transport from astrocytes to remyelinating oligodendrocytes. These processes may damage structure and compete with neuronal pathways for bioenergetic resources, thereby impairing cognitive function.

## Methods
Fifty-one male F344 rats (3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 23-months-old; n = 9 per age group except n = 15 in the 23-month-old group) were obtained from the NIA aging rodent colony maintained by Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were maintained on ad libitum food and water, and housed individually. Animals were allowed to acclimate to new surroundings for one month before starting behavioral studies. All protocols and procedures were in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved procedures.

Animals were trained on the Morris water maze (MWM) task, with methods similar to those described previously ( Rowe et al., 2007 ). Briefly, the maze consisted of a black tub 1.9 m in diameter filled with 26 ± 2° C water, placed in the middle of a darkened room, and equipped with 3 prominent black and white cues (70 × 70 cm). Walls, ceiling and floor were painted black. A Plexiglas escape platform (15 cm diameter) was located in the center of one of the quadrants of the pool. The animals were trained over 9 trials (3 trials per day for 3 days-the training phase) to find the submerged platform. An inter-trial interval of 1.25 min was used during which 30 s was spent on the platform and 45 s was spent in a heated holding chamber. Start quadrant was changed daily and animals were never placed in the quadrant containing the escape platform. The platform stayed in the same quadrant for the duration of the study until the fourth day, when the platform was removed (retention or probe day). On the sixth day, animals were tested on a single cued trial (visible platform + cue on platform) to assess visual acuity and non-cognitive effects on performance. Animal motion was visually tracked with the Videomex software (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) and a digital camera (Columbus Instruments). Latency to find the hidden platform, averaged across the 8 th and 9 th training trials on Day 3, and latency to enter an area centered above the platform and twice its area (annulus) on the probe trial were used to assess retention. Training latencies appear to stabilize by Day 3 under our conditions, and reliably identify cognitive impairment ( Rowe et al., 2007 ). Path length data for both training and probe trials were largely consistent with latency measures ( Table 1 ). Two 23-month-old animals were removed from the study because of poor health (one died at the end of training and one was too weak to complete training). Seven additional animals (four 23-month-old, two 12-month-old and one 6-month-old) failed to meet criterion on both the cued and retention tasks (i.e., did not find the platform in 60 s) and were excluded from behavioral analysis because of potential sensorimotor deficits unrelated to cognition.

To minimize stress and hypothermia, two factors that might influence gene expression and/or MWM performance, we gradually (2 weeks) acclimated the animals to the facility and handlers. In addition, a minimum of 30 min acclimation time in the MWM room began each daily session. Hypothermia was minimized by warming the water and placing heat lamps near animal cages between and after each trial.

On day 7, the day after the last (cued) trial, subjects were anesthetized deeply (intraperitoneal pentobarbital, 80 mg/kg) and euthanatized by intracardial perfusion with cold saline. Brains were rapidly removed and hemisected. The right hemisphere went to immunohistochemistry. The left hemisphere’s hippocampus was dissected away and the CA1 region was sub-dissected out under a stereo scope, as described previously ( Blalock et al., 2003 ). Each animal’s CA1 region was placed in a separate, labeled 1.5 ml centrifuge tube, immediately placed in dry ice, and stored at −80° C until used for microarray studies (see below).

RNA was extracted from each CA1 tissue block, as described previously ( Blalock et al., 2003 ), using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), precipitated with ethanol, reconstituted in RNase free water, and quantified and checked for RNA integrity with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. For each CA1 sample, 5ug of total RNA was processed to generate biotin-labeled cRNA following the standard protocol in the Affymetrix expression analysis technical manual, of which 20ug labeled-cRNA was then applied to a rat RAE230A GeneChip (Affymetrix) for hybridization (one chip per animal). Scanned microarray images were analyzed using the Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS5; Affymetrix) algorithm. A total of 49 GeneChips were used in this study. The study is uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) under accession number GSE9990 and quality control results are reported ( Supplemental Table D ). Probe set annotations were downloaded from Affymetrix and integrated with signal intensity and presence call data for further analysis (see Statistics).

Microarray-identified candidate proteins for which well-characterized specific antibodies are available were selected for IHC, and semi-quantitative analysis was performed on the hippocampus in 3 coronal sections from each animal in the Young (3 month), Midlife (12 month) and Aged (23 month) groups as described previously ( Kadish and Van Groen, 2002 ). Briefly, after perfusion with cold saline half of the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight. Brains were transferred to 30% sucrose solution the following day for cryoprotection and cut on microtome into 30 μm thick coronal sections. Sections planned for cathepsin D staining were pretreated in boiling Na citrate, pH 6.0, for 30 min prior to incubation with primary antibody. For single immunoperoxidase staining, tissues were transferred to primary antibody solution for 18 h [an anti-S100A4 rabbit (1:500, NeoMarkers), anti-ApoE goat (1:400, Santa Cruz), anti-SOAT-1 rabbit (1:500, Cayman), anti-cathepsin D goat (1:1000, Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-oligodendrocytic RIP, (1:100000, Chemicon)] in Tris buffered saline with 0.5% Triton Z-100 (TBS-T) added. After incubation, sections were rinsed 3X in TBS-T and transferred to the appropriate secondary antibody [goat anti-mouse biotin (1:500, Sigma); goat anti-rabbit biotin (1:500, Abcam); rabbit anti-goat (1:500, Abcam)] for 2 h and transferred to a solution containing mouse ExtrAvidin (Sigma). Sections were rinsed (3x TBS-T) and incubated for 3 min with nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) ( Kadish and Van Groen, 2002 ). For double immunofluorescence staining, sections were incubated with a mixture of anti-GFAP mouse (1:1000, Sigma) and one of the following: anti-S100A4 (NeoMarkers), ApoE (Santa Cruz), cathepsin D (Santa Cruz) or SOAT-1 (Cayman), and then with goat anti-mouse FITC (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or donkey anti-goat Cy3 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Grayscale images of the appropriated areas were acquired with an Olympus Optical (Tokyo, Japan) DP70 digital camera. For each antibody, all sections were processed in parallel. Optical density of the region of interest was measured using ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) on a standardized area at three different septotemporal levels at similar lateromedial positions.

Behavioral data were analyzed by 1-ANOVA with post hoc protected all-pairwise Tukey’s comparisons to control for multiple testing error. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical density data were averaged across sections to create a single measure per animal, and differences between young and aged animals were assessed by ANOVA or unpaired heteroschedastic t-test (as noted in Results). Microarray data were pre-statistically filtered as described previously ( Blalock et al., 2003 ). Unique, annotated gene probe sets rated present on at least 6 chips in the study were retained for statistical analysis. The presence call cutoff of 6 was chosen based on factorial analysis indicating that there was a < 5% probability that 6 presence calls would be found in a set of 49 chips by chance (E. Blalock, unpublished). Outlier signal intensity (expression) data (> 2 SD from the group mean for each probe set in each age group) were treated as missing values. Data were analyzed by 1-ANOVA for significant differences and the extent to which the error of multiple testing might have contributed was estimated by the False Discovery Rate (FDR) ( Hochberg and Benjamini, 1990 ). Each gene found significant at p ≤ 0.05 by ANOVA (aging-related genes, or ARGs) was then correlated with 10 idealized templates (see Fig. 1 for upregulated patterns), to determine the aging-related ‘shape’ of change for each gene. Each template was an artificial construct made up of 5 numbers, one for each age (3, 6, 9, 12, and 23 months). For example, the Δ3–6 template, designed to detect ARGs that changed from 3 to 6 months of age and then showed stable expression from 6 to 23 months ( Fig. 1 ), was constructed with a 3 month value of 0, and then 6, 9, 12 and 23 month values of 1 (0,1,1,1,1). In contrast, the Δ6–23 template was constructed to reflect a later onset of change and a progressive increase across age (0,0,1,2,3). For each identified ARG, mean signal intensity values for each of the five age groups were correlated to each of the 10 idealized templates. A positive correlation indicated an upregulated gene and a negative correlation a downregulated gene. A gene was assigned to the template with which it had the highest Pearson’s r value, if that r value exceeded |0.87|. Thus, some genes rated significant by ANOVA failed to meet criterion and were not assigned to any template. Genes that met criteria were allocated to an age-of-onset based upon the template to which they were assigned (see Fig. 1 and Results). Functional processes represented by the assigned ARGs were determined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) overrepresentation clustering analysis tool ( Dennis et al., 2003 ) on the Gene Ontology (GO) databases of Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function ( Ashburner et al., 2000 ). To avoid redundancy, only a single illustrative process for each cluster of similar significantly overrepresented processes (p < 0.05; EASE score), populated by between 3 and 50 genes, is reported (Results). Further, for the mid-aged (12 mo: n = 7) and aged (23 mo: n = 9) animals that reached criteria on the Morris Water Maze (see above), ANOVA-significant genes were also tested by post hoc Pearson’s test for correlations with behavioral variables. These correlations were performed within the 12 and 23 month old groups separately, as well as within the 12 + 23 month old groups combined. Importantly, the same filtered microarray data set used for ANOVA analysis was used here. Thus, if outliers were removed in the ANOVA, those outlier values also were not included in the correlation analysis, which is highly sensitive to the effects of outliers.

## Results
Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of the protocols employed in the present studies. F344 male rats in five age groups were trained and tested for cognitive performance and brains were divided, with one half being used for IHC and the other half being used to identify aging changes in hippocampal gene expression, as described below.

MWM performance data for 42 animals that met behavioral criteria (of an original 49 rats-Methods) in five age groups are shown in Table 1 . Two primary measures of retention (cognitive function) were obtained: Latency to find the hidden platform, averaged across the 8 th and 9 th training trials on Day 3, and latency to enter the platform annulus on the probe trial. Both of these indexes assessed retention performance near the end of training. The average training latency on trials 8 and 9 (Day 3) was selected as the primary index of retention for the gene expression-behavioral correlation analyses described below, as training latency stabilizes by Day 3 under our conditions and reliably identifies cognitive impairment ( Rowe et al., 2007 ). Path length data for both training and probe trials were largely consistent with the latency measures ( Table 1 ). Performance on the last two training trials showed a clear effect of age, with both the 12-month and 23-month groups differing significantly from the 3-month group. Performance on the probe retention trial appeared less age-sensitive, with only the 23-month group differing from the 3-month group.

The CA1 region from one hippocampus of each animal was processed on an individual Affymetrix RAE230A microarray. After filtering out absence calls and ESTs ( Blalock et al., 2003 ), 4,270 gene probe sets were retained for testing ( Fig. 1 ). Each was tested by 1-way ANOVA across all five groups to determine which genes changed with aging (p ≤ 0.05). A total of 923 genes were found by ANOVA to differ with age, for a false discovery rate of ~0.25 (FDR: expected false positives from multiple testing/total observed positives). This FDR is reasonable for a microarray study, in which added confidence is provided by co-regulation (overrepresentation) of related genes in the same functional category ( Mirnics and Pevsner, 2004 ; Blalock et al., 2005 ; Rowe et al., 2007 ). Moreover, in the present study, microarray results were confirmed by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry of corresponding protein expression for 5 identified genes (see below).

To identify the age of onset, defined as the age range in which changed expression was first detectable for an aging-related gene (ARG), we utilized 10 idealized templates of frequent profiles to extrapolate the aging change back to the age range of earliest apparent divergence from its 3-month-old baseline ( Fig. 1 shows the 10 templates used for upregulated genes; negative correlations to the 10 templates were used for downregulated genes). Based upon the idealized template ( Fig. 1 ) with which it correlated most highly, each gene was assigned to one of four onset-of-change age ranges: Early Adult-onset (change beginning between 3 and 6 months-old); Intermediate-onset (change beginning between 6 and 9 months); Midlife-onset (change beginning between 9 and 12 months); and Late-onset (change beginning between 12 and 23 months).

The numbers of ARGs assigned to each onset age range are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . The complete list of gene symbols/names of up- and down-regulated genes in each onset range, along with mean expression values at each age, is organized by template pattern in Supplemental Table A , and organized alphabetically in Supplemental Table B . As in our prior studies, more ARGs were found to be upregulated than downregulated ( Table 2 ). More genes were assigned to the Early-onset range than to any other, although Late-onset genes ranked a close second. Figure 2 provides a heat map of highly significant genes assigned to each age range and shows the standardized average pattern for each age range. It can be seen that these standardized averages closely resemble the idealized templates used for original correlation and assignment ( Fig. 1 ).

To control for age as a potentially confounding factor in correlation, we focused primarily on within-group same-age correlations. Only the 12-month and 23-month groups showed evidence of cognitive impairment, and therefore, cognitive performance was tested for correlation with ARGs only within each of those two age groups. In addition, because they did not differ on Day-3 retention latency ( Table 1 ), these two groups were combined for an overall correlation test between performance and expression of each gene. The numbers of genes that correlated with cognitive performance (p ≤ 0.05) on at least one of the three tests (within 12-month group, within 23-month group, within combined 12+23-month group) are shown in parentheses in Table 2 , and are listed individually by onset age range in Supplemental Table C . Upregulated ARGs with Midlife-onset range were more likely to be correlated with MWM performance (which also showed Midlife onset of change) than ARGs in any of the other onset ranges ( Table 2 ; p < 0.05 for binomial test of Midlife range against every other upregulated age range). An example of one such correlation (12+23 combined) is illustrated in Fig. 3 for Apoe, which showed the highest average r-value across all three within-group correlation tests of all upregulated ARGs.

To determine which pathways/processes began to be activated or suppressed at different stages of adult life, we identified the functional categories in the Gene Ontology database (GO) ( Ashburner et al., 2000 ) that were represented by a statistically higher proportion of aging-related genes than would be predicted by chance (overrepresented categories), using DAVID analysis ( Dennis et al., 2003 ) of gene functional assignments. Such overrepresentation often reflects a high degree of co-regulation within a pathway ( Mirnics and Pevsner, 2004 ; Blalock et al., 2005 ). Genes for each onset range (Early, Intermediate, Midlife and Late) and each direction of change (up or down) were uploaded and analyzed separately. DAVID’s functional annotation clustering tool identifies overrepresented functional processes, and also groups such processes based on overlap among populating genes. To reduce redundancy, we are reporting ( Table 3 ) only the process that appears to be the most informative and characteristic for each cluster.

Table 3 shows these overrepresented functional processes for up- and down-regulated genes for each age of onset, along with the lists of gene symbols populating all such processes (Each gene symbol shown is also listed alphabetically with gene name/protein name in Supplemental Table B ). GO annotation/assignment is still a work in progress, and many genes have not yet been fully assigned. Accordingly, we have added some ARGs omitted by DAVID analysis to processes that appeared to be appropriate based on literature review. These added gene symbols are shown in italics. Also added (and italicized) under the Early-onset range are two sets of lipid-related genes reflecting up- and down-regulated lipid metabolic processes. These processes were not identified in DAVID but are suggested by the literature to represent co-regulated functional groupings.

Table 3 also highlights (with underlining) all ARGs in the overrepresented processes that showed at least one significant within-group correlation with cognitive impairment (full list in Supplemental Table C ). Note that, as indicated in Table 2 , these are particularly numerous among upregulated Midlife-onset categories.

Upregulated aging-related genes that began to change soon after reproductive maturity were statistically associated with ribosomal assembly, growth, lysosomal, stress/inflammatory and protein/lipid degradative pathways, whereas downregulated ARGs were associated with neuronal development and energy-dependent signaling/transporter pathways. This pattern appears to reflect a shift in energy sources, as indicated by altered regulation of genes for lipid and amino acid catabolism.

ARGs important in lipid/cholesterol synthesis (e.g., Cyp51, Elovl6) or uptake into cells (Lpl) were largely downregulated, whereas those important in lipid degradation (Acadl, Decr1) or extrusion/transport (Abca2, Npc2) were generally upregulated. Increased Pdk2 expression was included in the lipid degradation category ( Table 3 ), as this increase favors a shift from glucose to free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation in generating substrates for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This shift appears similar to a Randle-cycle shift ( Randle, 1998 ; Holness and Sugden, 2003 ) (see Discussion), evidence of which has also been seen previously in aging brain ( Rowe et al., 2007 ; Brinton, 2008 ).

Although changes in early-onset genes were detected beyond an age range generally defined as adulthood in rodents (3 months), it nevertheless seems possible that some changes from 3 to 6 months could reflect the end of late developmental processes rather than the onset of aging changes. However, such developmental expression patterns seemingly should be expected to plateau by 6 month of age. While some early-onset genes fulfilled this developmental pattern, the large majority fit linear or progressive templates more consistent with aging-related patterns of expression ( Fig. 1 , Table 2 ; Supplemental Table A ). Therefore, our data indicate that the onset of some genomic aging processes occurs very early in adulthood, during or soon after reproductive maturation (i.e., between 3- and 6-months-old).

Although this onset age range contained the fewest ARGs and functional processes Tables 2 , 3 ), upregulated ARGs in this phase prominently included key cytokines and regulators of the innate immune/inflammatory and complement pathways, as well as regulators of proteolytic processes. Downregulated ARGs represented categories of ion channels/transport (e.g., Grin1 encoding NMDAR1) and vesicle transport. Interestingly, several of the upregulated inflammatory ARGs (Il6st, Stat3) are critical signaling molecules in the interleukin-6/leukemia inhibitory factor (Il6/LIF) pathways that have been implicated in both astrocytic differentiation ( Mi et al., 2001 ) and oligodendrocytic myelination ( Ishibashi et al., 2006 ). Thus, these changes could foreshadow the evidence of astrocyte reactivity and myelinogenesis seen in subsequent phases (see below).

The first evidence of cognitive impairment appeared in the Midlife phase ( Table 1 ), as did the highest number and proportion of (upregulated) ARGs correlated with cognitive performance ( Table 2 ). Upregulated ARGs were overrepresented for processes of astrocyte reactivity/cytoskeletal structure (Gfap, S100a4, Cd81, Arpb1c), cation/iron homeostasis (myelinogenesis), glycosyl transferase activity and, notably, lipid metabolism, the latter enriched with genes involved in cholesterol esterification and its transport by lipoproteins or intracellular storage (e.g., Apoe, Clu/Apoj, Lcat, Pcyt1a, Gm2a, Srebf1). As noted ( Fig. 3 ), Apoe was the gene most consistently correlated with cognitive impairment among all upregulated ARGs ( Supplemental Table C ). New sets of inflammation/immunity and protein processing ARGs also began to upregulate during the Midlife-onset phase, in particular, ARGs with antigen-presenting roles (B2m, Ctss, Hla-dmb, Psme2, Psmb8, RT1-Aw2, RT1-M3) that perhaps reflect a later phase of inflammatory damage and elevated proteolysis. Concurrently, there was downregulation of additional ARGs for energy-dependent signaling, vesicle transport, GTPase activity and neurite outgrowth, a category including behaviorally-correlated App, the gene for amyloid precursor protein.

The late-life period was characterized by onset of numerous additional genes in categories already exhibiting change, namely in upregulated immune/inflammatory and ribosomal/biosynthetic processes and downregulated energy-dependent signaling, transporter and cytoskeletal processes. This pattern appeared to reflect expansion of alterations in functional processes already set in motion.

To elucidate the cell-type origins of key changes in expression, semi-quantitative IHC was performed on six proteins that were of particular interest because they were representative of Midlife-upregulated processes that coincided with onset of cognitive decline and/or had some relationship to cholesterol trafficking. The proteins selected for quantitative IHC (with names, corresponding gene symbols, onset ages and primary protein function) were: ApoE (apolipoprotein E, Apoe, Midlife-up; cholesterol transport); CathD (cathepsin-D, Ctsd, Midlife-up; lysosomal protease); S100A4 (S100a4, Midlife-up; white matter astrocyte marker, response to injury); GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein, Gfap, Midlife-up, structural marker of astrocyte reactivity); and ApoD (apolipoprotein D, Apod, Intermediate-up; sterol transporter in oligodendrocytes, response to stress). In addition, we quantified SOAT1/ACAT1 (sterol O-acyltransferase/acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase, Soat1; catalyzes cholesterol esterification for intracellular storage and transport). Although the gene, Soat1 was not rated present in this study (possibly because it is expressed primarily in astrocytes in or near white matter ( Fig. 4 ), which was trimmed and reduced in these dissected CA1 microarray samples, as described earlier), it was previously found to be an ARG in non-trimmed hippocampal samples ( Rowe et al., 2007 ), and the SOAT1 IHC here clearly showed a major effect of aging by midlife ( Fig. 4 ). We also used the RIP (receptor interacting protein) antibody against myelin to quantify the degree of hippocampal myelination with aging. RIP immunostaining provided sensitive visualization of aging changes in myelinated fibers ( Fig. 5 ), which was confirmed by several other myelin antibodies we compared.

All four of the proteins studied across 3-, 12-, and 23-month old animals by IHC exhibited clear increases with aging (ApoE, p = 0.018; CathD, p = 2.44 −7 ; S100A4, p = 9.23 −13 ; GFAP, p = 1.44 −8 ; 1-ANOVA). In addition, SOAT1 was highly significant (p = 1.45 −6 ; t-test) ( Rowe et al., 2007 )., and APOD was clearly elevated with age (determined by visual rating alone because there was essentially no ApoD immunostaining in young animals whereas aged animals showed numerous stained somata in white matter tracts). For further validation, results for all four proteins that were quantified in three age groups were tested for rank-order correlation with the microarray-based measures of corresponding gene expression, and all were significantly correlated (Spearman’s test: n = 23–26; ApoE, p = 6.55 −3 ; CathD, p = 2.57 −7 ; S100A4, p = 6.37 −11 ; GFAP, p = 2.09 −7 ).

The IHC results showed clearly that many of the key midlife changes took place in astrocytes. Upregulation of cholesterol trafficking (ApoE, SOAT1), structural reactivity (S100a4) and lysosomal activation (punctate CathD) occurred primarily in astrocytes (although CathD was also upregulated in a non-punctate manner in neurons) ( Figs. 4 , 5 ). The quantitative effects were readily apparent in photomicrographs ( Fig. 4 ). Double labeled images ( Fig. 5 ) clearly revealed predominant co-localization with astrocytic GFAP of ApoE, CathD, SOAT1 and S100A4 (the latter two primarily in astrocytes of the white matter and adjacent stratum oriens) ( Fig. 4 ). Moreover, the ApoD results indicated upregulated transport in oligodendrocytes with aging, and the RIP data revealed an increase in myelin staining with age (p = 0.042, t-test). Increased RIP immunostaining with aging can be seen in myelinated axons traversing the CA1 strata radiatum and oriens and in white matter tracts ( Fig. 5 ), consistent with our microarray data showing widespread aging-related upregulation of myelin protein genes ( Blalock et al., 2003 ; Rowe et al., 2007 ), as well as with E.M. data ( Peters et al., 2000 ).

## Discussion
This is the first study to elucidate aging changes in hippocampal expression comprehensively across the adult lifespan. The resulting temporal perspective allows identification of early aging processes that may be candidates for trigger mechanisms, and identifies Midlife-onset changes that may be candidates for a role in the onset of cognitive decline. The correlative data presented here cannot, of course, provide direct evidence of a causal relationship nor can they directly distinguish detrimental aging changes from compensatory/beneficial or incidental changes. However, close correlation is one of the key predictions of a causal hypothesis, and failure to find correlation can eliminate many potential candidates from further testing, an important consideration in global studies.

Early-Adult Range downregulated genes appeared to reflect a decrease in lipid/cholesterol synthesis and neurite outgrowth, whereas Early-Adult upregulated genes reflected activation of stress, growth and ribosomal assembly (Results, Table 3 ). Of particular note was the upregulation of genes for lysosomal processes and catabolic generation of ketogenic amino acids (AAs) (Qdpr, Aadat, Maob) and free fatty acids (FFAs) (Acadl, Decr1, Pdk2), also found previously in hippocampus of aged rats ( Rowe et al., 2007 ). This pattern, strongly suggests a metabolic shift favoring oxidation of FFAs and ketone bodies (KBs) while conserving glucose by gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis and glycogen synthesis, capabilities which astrocytes appear to share uniquely with hepatocytes (see Rowe et al., 2007 ). This age-related metabolic shift ( Rowe et al., 2007 ; Brinton, 2008 ) can be likened to a shift in the ‘Randle cycle’, which regulates the competitive balance between FFAs and glucose as substrates for the TCA cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation favors glucose oxidation, whereas its inactivation by PDH kinases (e.g., Pdk2) favors FFA oxidation and glucose conservation ( Randle, 1998 ; Holness and Sugden, 2003 ). As lipoproteins or FFAs do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, increased energy substrates would likely have to be obtained from extracellular structures, debris and myelin (see below), consistent with upregulation of lysosomal pathways ( Table 3 ). However, additional studies will be required to determine whether this shift represents a genetically ‘programmed’ change, an adaptation to another process (e.g., membrane degradation from oxidative stress), or an incidental change.

In the following Intermediate Age Range (6–9 months-old), elevated expression was pronounced for inflammatory cytokines and complement molecules ( Table 3 ). Many inflammatory/oxidative processes apparently originate in microglia and their activation might mediate degradation of the myelin sheath and other membranes. As myelin is highly enriched in phospholipids, cholesterol and proteins, this degradation, in turn, would generate increased FFAs and AAs as potential fuel substrates.

The Midlife Age Range (9–12 months-old) was the period in which evidence of cognitive impairment first appeared ( Table 1 ), consistent with previous studies in rodents and other species that detected onset of cognitive decline around or before the midpoint of the lifespan (~12 months-old in F344 rats) ( Markowska and Savonenko, 2002 ; Disterhoft and Oh, 2006 ). Interestingly, midlife is also the period in which we previously first detected emergence of Ca 2+ -related electrophysiological markers of hippocampal aging ( Gant et al., 2006 ) and in which initial changes in long-term potentiation have been found ( Lynch et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, midlife upregulated ARGs exhibited the highest proportion of genes correlated with cognitive impairment ( Tables 2 , 3 ). Consequently, it appears possible that the Midlife range is a critical convergent phase in which expression changes begin to interact with electrophysiological processes and negatively impact cognitive functions.

Immune response genes activated in the Midlife phase differed from those in earlier periods by the predominance in midlife of upregulated ARGs important in antigen presentation (e.g., immunoproteasome subunits, MHC I and MHC II molecules) ( Table 3 ). Increased expression of MHC II molecules has been seen previously in aged brain ( Blalock et al., 2003 ; McGeer and McGeer, 2004 ; Frank et al., 2006 ), and largely reflects activation of microglia, the resident antigen presenting cells of the CNS. This midlife upregulation of antigen presenting ARGs may reflect a new level or phase of intensified tissue damage and proteolysis, but additional studies will be needed to assess its functional implications.

Upregulation also began in midlife for a significant number of myelinogenic/oligodendrocytic genes, including Mobp and Mog, and several iron-regulating genes (Fth1, Ftl1, Mt3) correlated with cognitive function. Oligodendrocytes are the cells with the highest concentrations of iron in the brain and iron is critical for myelinogenesis ( Connor and Menzies, 1996 ; Bartzokis et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the increased expression of myelinogenic/iron-related genes may well be related to the aging-related increase in immunostaining of myelin in corpus callosum and hippocampus ( Fig. 5 ). Earlier work in monkeys, humans and rodents also found increased or continuing activation of myelination programs in aging brains ( Peters et al., 2000 ; Blalock et al., 2003 ; Bartzokis et al., 2007 ; Rowe et al., 2007 ). In addition, human and monkey studies suggest that myelin degeneration and rarefaction may develop with advanced age, perhaps indicating a late stage of vulnerability in the more extensively myelinated brains of primates.

A substantial number of cholesterol and phospholipid trafficking genes/proteins also showed initial upregulation in the Midlife range (e.g., Apoe, Clu/ApoJ, Lcat, Srebf1, Pcyt1a; Table 3 ). These findings importantly extend previous studies ( Blalock et al., 2003 ; Rowe et al., 2007 ) by showing that much of this cholesterol pathway upregulation occurs in midlife and generally coincides with onset of cognitive impairment. In addition, some cholesterol-related ARGs were positively correlated with cognitive dysfunction, particularly Apoe, which was the upregulated gene most consistently correlated with cognitive impairment in this study ( Fig 3 ; Supplemental Table C ).

Upon maturation, much of the excess free cholesterol in brain appears to be disposed of via metabolism to oxysterols and transport to neurons or extrusion into blood vessels ( Dietschy and Turley, 2001 ; Bjorkhem, 2006 ). However, it is unclear why cholesterol trafficking pathways might exhibit a new phase of upregulation at midlife. In the liver, many cholesterol trafficking genes are known targets of the nuclear liver-X-receptor (LXR), and an LXR-ApoE pathway also appears to be present in brain, induced primarily in astrocytes by high cholesterol or its metabolites ( Petanceska et al., 2003 ; Liang et al., 2004 ; Abildayeva et al., 2006 ). Therefore, one possible explanation for a midlife phase of activated cholesterol trafficking is that a new source of excess free cholesterol develops, possibly as a byproduct of lysosomal degradation of cholesterol-rich myelin fragments, in turn activating upregulation of ApoE and other cholesterol trafficking genes/proteins in astrocytes ( Figs. 4 , 5 ). In addition, the data also suggest a novel pathway for the disposal of this putative midlife cholesterol excess. That is, upregulation of myelinogenic programs, cholesterol transport molecules in oligodendrocytes (Apod, Abca2), and apparent myelination ( Fig. 5 ) suggest that transport of cholesteryl esters in ApoE-containing lipoproteins from astrocytes to remyelinating oligodendrocytes may mediate incorporation and long-term storage of excess cholesterol in new myelin.

Studies in AD-mouse models have shown that pharmacologic or genetic enhancement of brain LXR-ApoE cholesterol transport/storage pathways increases clearance and/or reduces deposition of beta amyloid in brain ( Holtzman et al., 2000 ; Rebeck et al., 2002 ; Puglielli et al., 2003 ; Cao et al., 2007 ; Koldamova and Lefterov, 2007 ; Landreth et al., 2008 ). Conversely, however, elevated ApoE expression may be associated with brain degeneration under some conditions ( Gallardo et al., 2008 ). Moreover, high dietary cholesterol (associated with elevated AD risk) stimulates, whereas statins reduce, ApoE expression in astrocytes ( Petanceska et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, the findings here provide new evidence that elevated ApoE expression in hippocampus is correlated positively with cognitive impairment in normal brain aging ( Fig. 3 ). Accordingly, whether upregulation of ApoE and cholesterol transport pathways is beneficial or harmful may depend on tradeoffs between the damage caused by accumulation of a toxic substance (e.g., cholesterol, beta amyloid) vs. the metabolic costs of upregulating the energy-expensive cholesterol trafficking pathway to clear the substance. Thus, the level of activity in the cholesterol trafficking pathway may be an important target for regulating the intersection between normal brain aging and AD.

Together, the findings suggest a novel sequential model of hippocampal aging, in which early shifts in bioenergetic processes lead to inflammatory/oxidative degradation of myelin and other membranes, generating energy substrates. However, this degradation also releases excess cholesterol that by midlife activates cholesterol transport from astrocytes to oligodendrocytes for cholesterol storage/disposal via myelinogenesis. These energy-expensive glial responses damage neurons and compete for energy with neuronal signaling pathways, inducing cognitive impairment in the most susceptible subjects ( Fig. 6 ). In this view, astrocytes function in brain analogously to hepatocytes in conserving glucose and regulating cholesterol trafficking, myelin functions in the brain analogously to peripheral adipose tissue in the periphery, serving as a source for FFAs, and elevated inflammatory processes function somewhat analogously to peripheral stress pathways that generate FFA/AA substrates. Alternative models could, of course, account for these results, including those based on the converse sequence, in which increased metabolic utilization of FFAs is an adaptive response to initial inflammatory/oxidative damage and lipid degradation. Regardless of whether the present view is correct, however, these data on lifespan aging changes should provide an important new basis for sequential and testable models of brain aging cascades.
