# Title
Transmission and spreading of tauopathy in transgenic mouse brain

# Abstract
Hyperphosphorylated tau makes up the filamentous intracellular inclusions of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease 1 . In the disease process neuronal tau inclusions first appear in transentorhinal cortex, from where they appear to spread to hippocampal formation and neocortex 2 . Cognitive impairment becomes manifest when inclusions reach the hippocampus, with abundant neocortical tau inclusions and extracellular β-amyloid deposits being the defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Abundant tau inclusions, in the absence of β-amyloid deposits, define Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and other diseases 1 . Tau mutations cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, establishing that tau protein dysfunction is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia 3 - 5 . Thus, transgenic mice expressing mutant (e.g. P301S) human tau in nerve cells exhibit the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration and abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein 6 , 7 . In contrast, mouse lines expressing single isoforms of wild-type human tau do not produce tau filaments or display neurodegeneration 7 , 8 . Here we have used tau-expressing lines to investigate whether experimental tauopathy can be transmitted. We show that the injection of brain extract from mutant P301S tau-expressing mice into the brain of transgenic wild-type tau-expressing animals induces the assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and the spreading of pathology from the site of injection to neighbouring brain regions.

## METHODS
Homozygous human wild-type tau ALZ17 transgenic mice 8 , homozygous human P301S tau transgenic mice 6 and non-transgenic control mice, all females on a C57BL/6 background, were used. Experiments were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the local Basel Committee for Animal Care and Animal Use.

Six month-old mice transgenic for human P301S tau and age-matched non-transgenic control mice were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and killed by decapitation. Brainstems were dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C. Brainstems from 3 mice were combined and homogenized at 10% (w/v) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), briefly sonicated (Branson 450, output 2, 5 times 0.9 sec) and centrifuged at 3,000×g at 4° C for 5 min. The supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen and kept at −80° C until use.

Brainstem extracts from mice transgenic for human P301S tau were centrifuged at 100,000×g at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatants containing soluble tau were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. The pellets containing insoluble tau were resuspended in the original volume of PBS, sonicated (Branson 450, output 1.5, 3 times 0.9 sec), aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.

A mixture of anti-tau antibodies HT7 (Pierce, Rockford, IL), AT8 (Pierce), and TAU-5 (Biosource, Camarilla, CA) (20 μg of each antibody) was incubated for 2 h with 10 μl of Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast flow (PGS, Pharmacia). Sepharose beads were washed twice with 1 ml PBS and the liquid removed with a glass capillary. P301S brain extract (100 μl, prepared as described above) was added to semi-dry beads and allowed to react overnight at 4°C on an overhead mixer. The beads were settled by centrifugation (1 min, 200×g) and 70 μl of the tau-depleted supernatant were removed. Five μl were used for Western blot analysis and the remainder stored at −80°C until use. As a control, P301S extract was treated as above, but in the absence of anti-tau antibodies.

Brain extracts were run on 8% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Zug, Switzerland) and probed with anti-tau antibodies HT7 (1:1,000), AT8 (1:1,000) and AT100 (1:200, Pierce). HT7 recognizes human tau, but not mouse tau 29 , AT8 labels tau phosphorylated at S202 and T205 30 and AT100 detects tau phosphorylated at T212, S214 and T217 31 . The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). For signal detection, ECL plus (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was used in conjunction with Amersham Hyperfilm ECL.

Three month-old ALZ17 mice and non-transgenic C57BL/6 control mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg). When deeply anaesthetized, the mice were placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature during surgery. Using a Hamilton syringe, the hippocampus (A/P, −2.5 mm from bregma; L, +/− 2.0 mm; D/V, −1.8 mm) and the overlying cerebral cortex (A/P, −2.5 mm from bregma; L, +/− 2.0 mm; D/V, −0.8 mm) each received a unilateral (right hemisphere) stereotaxic injection of 2.5 μl brain extract, at a speed of 1.25 μl/min. Following injection, the needle was kept in place for an additional 3 min before gentle withdrawal. The surgical area was cleaned with sterile saline and the incision sutured. Mice were monitored until recovery from anaesthesia and checked weekly following surgery. For sham-lesioned wild-type mice (n=3), the same procedure was applied without injection of brain extract.

ALZ17 mice were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and killed by transcardial perfusion with 20 ml cold PBS, followed by 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were dissected and post-fixed overnight. Following paraffin embedding, 5 μm coronal sections were prepared. Sections were silver-impregnated following the method of Gallyas-Braak to visualize filamentous tau pathology 10 , 11 . Haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) was performed for morphological analysis. For immunohistochemistry, the following anti-tau antibodies were used: T14 (1:1,000, Zymed, San Francisco, CA), AT8 (1:1,000), AT100 (1:1,000), BR189 (1:500), BR304 (1:500) and MT1 (1:500). T14 is specific for human tau 32 . MT1 was raised against amino acids 114-127 of the longest brain isoform of mouse tau. It is specific for mouse tau and does not recognize human tau 6 . BR189 and BR304 were raised against amino acids 76-87 and 45-73 of tau, respectively (in the numbering of the longest human brain tau isoform). They are specific for tau isoforms with one (BR304) or two (BR304 and BR189) N-terminal inserts 9 . Antibody Olig2 (1:500, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used to stain oligodendrocytes. Antibodies NF200 (1:100, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), Iba1 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), GFAP (1:100, Abcam), and MBP (1:500, Abcam) were used to visualize neurofilaments, astrocytes, microglia, and myelin basic protein, respectively. Secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA (Vectastain ABC kit).

Immunoelectron microscopy of injected P301S brain extract using anti-tau antibody BR134 was performed as described 33 . BR134 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 428-441 of tau 9 . In some experiments, sarkosyl-insoluble tau was prepared from injected ALZ17 brains, as described 34 . Anti-tau antibodies BR134, BR189, BR304 and AT100 were used to identify tau filaments.

ALZ17 mice injected with P301S brain extract were analyzed at 6, 12 and 15 months post-injection (five mice per time point). Gallyas-Braak-stained coronal sections were selected at identical brain coordinates 35 (anterior to the injection level, − 0.8 mm from bregma; injection level, − 2.5 mm from bregma; posterior to the injection level, − 3.8 mm from bregma). Silver-positive structures (neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and coiled bodies) were counted at these 3 levels with a ×20 objective (Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland). At the injection level (− 2.5 mm from bregma), total counts of silver-positive structures were assessed in the injection sites hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus and subiculum) and visual cortex. In the visual cortex, silver-positive lesions developed just around and at a very short distance from the needle tract. For semi-quantitative assessment, Gallyas-Braak staining was graded as follows: (−), no silver-positive structures; (+), < 20 silver-positive structures; (++), 20-40 silver-positive structures; (+++), > 40 silver-positive structures. For each group there was only slight variation between individual animals.

Statistical analysis of quantitative tau pathology data was performed using the Poisson regression algorithm with the help of the SAS 8.02 software. Link function was the logarithm and scale was estimated by deviance (to account for overdispersion). Significance tests for differences between mice at 12 months and at 6 months following inoculation with brain extract and between mice at 15 months and at 12 months following inoculation were obtained. No multiplicity correction was applied. The results of the significance tests are reported in Figure 2 (panels a and b), as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.001; ***p<0.0001.
