# Title
Presenilins are Essential for Regulating Neurotransmitter Release

# Abstract
Mutations in the presenilin genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Loss of presenilin activity and/or accumulation of amyloid-β peptides have been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of AD by impairing synaptic function 1 - 5 . However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we employ a genetic approach to inactivate presenilins conditionally in either presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. We found that long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation is decreased after presynaptic but not postsynaptic deletion of presenilins. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic inactivation of presenilins alters short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The probability of evoked glutamate release, measured with the open-channel NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, is reduced by presynaptic inactivation of presenilins. Strikingly, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -stores by thapsigargin or blockade of Ca 2+ -release from these stores by ryanodine receptor inhibitors mimics and occludes the effects of presynaptic presenilin inactivation. Collectively, these results reveal a selective role for presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release and LTP induction via modulation of intracellular Ca 2+ -release in presynaptic terminals, and further suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in AD.

## Methods summary
Acute hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared as described previously 3 . Synaptic strength was quantified as the initial slope of field potentials recorded with aCSF-filled microelectrodes (1 to 2 MΩ). Intracellular whole-cell recordings were performed using Multiclamp 700B in CA1 or CA3 pyramidal neurons. Data were analyzed using Igor and Clampfit. Experimenters were blind to the genotypes of the mice.

PS cDKO hippocampal neuronal cultures were derived from fPS1/fPS1;PS2 -/- pups at postnatal day 1, followed by infection of lentiviral vectors expressing either a functional Cre-GFP or a mutant Cre-GFP fusion protein at 2 DIV for 72 hr. Whole-cell patch recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons at 13-15 DIV were performed at room temperature using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier with pCLAMP acquisition software.

Hippocampal neurons were loaded with Fura-2 AM, and imaged with a Leica DMI6000 Microscope with 40X lens. Imaging processing and data analysis were performed using LAS AF software. High concentrations of potassium were applied using an 8-channel gravity perfusion system.

## Methods
CA1- and CA3- PS cDKO mice contain homozygous floxed PS1 alleles, homozygous PS2 -/- alleles and the Camk2a-Cre 7 and KA1-Cre 8 transgene, respectively. Since PS2 -/- mice have no detectable phenotypes 31 , it was unnecessary to generate floxed PS2 mice. For each cDKO mouse line, fPS1/fPS1;PS2-/-;Cre mice were bred with fPS1/fPS1;PS2-/- mice to obtain more cDKO mice ( fPS1/fPS1;PS2-/-;Cre ) and fPS1/fPS1;Cre were bred with fPS1/fPS1 to obtain control mice ( fPS1/fPS1 ). Introduction of two loxP sites into PS1 introns 1 and 3 was previously confirmed not to affect transcription, splicing and translation 9 . The genetic background of these mice was similar in the C57BL6/129 hybrid background with breeding carried out similarly for both groups. All procedures relating to animal care and treatment conformed to the Institutional and NIH guidelines.

In situ hybridization was carried out as previous described using a 260 bp sense or antisense riboprobe specific for PS1 exons 2 and 3 ( Ref. 32 ). For X-gal staining, Camk2a-Cre and KA1-Cre transgenic mice were bred to Rosa26-lacZ mice, and double transgenic offspring containing both the Cre and the lacZ transgenes were analyzed.

All electrophysiological analysis was performed by experimenters who were blind to the genotypes of the mice. Acute hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared as described before 3 . The slices were maintained in a storage chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF: 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 mM MgCl2, 2.6 mM CaCl 2 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 mM dextrose, pH 7.4, 300-310 mOsm) at 30°C. Stimulation (500 μs) pulses were delivered with a bipolar concentric metal electrode. Synaptic strength was quantified as the initial slope of field potentials recorded with aCSF-filled microelectrodes (1 to 2 MΩ). In LTP recordings, baseline responses were collected every 15 sec with a stimulation intensity that yielded 60% of maximal response. LTP was induced by five episodes of TBS delivered at 0.1 Hz. Each episode contains ten stimulus trains (5 pulses at 100 Hz) delivered at 5 Hz. Average responses (mean ± s.e.m.) are expressed as percentage of pre-TBS baseline response. Synaptic facilitations were measured as the percentage of the fEPSP slope vs. the 1 st fEPSP slope at a given stimulus train in individual slices.

Intracellular (whole-cell) recordings were performed using Multiclamp 700B (Molecular device) in CA1 or CA3 pyramidal neurons. Patch pipette (3-5 MΩ) were filled with internal solution consisting of (in mM): 110 Cs-Methanesulfonate, 20 TEA-Cl, 8 KCl, 10 EGTA, 10 Hepes, 5 QX-314, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na 2 GTP (pH = 7.3); 275-285 mOsm. AMPAR responses were recorded in the presence of 50 μM APV and 100 μM picrotoxin to block NMDAR- and GABA type A receptor-mediated responses, respectively. NMDAR responses were recorded in the presence of 10 μM CNQX and 100 μM picrotoxin to block AMPAR- and GABA type A receptor-mediated responses, respectively. For the MK-801 experiment, recordings of NMDAR-mediated EPSC were made every 20s before and during exposure to MK801 (40 μM). The NMDAR-mediated EPSC slope was plotted as a function of stimulus number. Decay curves were normalized to the amplitude of the first EPSC in the presence of MK-801 and were fitted to a single exponential curve to estimate the decay time course. NMDA-mediated EPSC was measured at +40 mV, and was elicited by focal stimulation in the presence of CNQX (10 μM) and picrotoxin (100 μM). To record calcium current through VGCCs, TTX (extracellular, 500 nM) and QX-314 (intracellular, 5 mM) were used to block sodium current; Cs + (intracellular, 110 mM) and TEA (intracellular, 20 mM) were used to block potassium current. To measure the synaptic facilitation, values of the fEPSP slope (2 nd , 3 rd …10 th responses in a 20-pulse stimulus train) were normalized to the slope of the 1 st fEPSP of the stimulus train. Data were analyzed using Igor (Wavemetrics) and Clampfit (Molecular device).

To circumvent the requirement of PS in neurogenesis during embryonic development 21 , 22 , we established PS cDKO hippocampal neuronal cultures derived from fPS1/fPS1;PS2 -/- newborn pups, followed by infection of lentiviral vectors expressing either a functional Cre-GFP or a mutant Cre-GFP fusion protein. Hippocampi from fPS1/fPS1;PS2 -/- pups were dissected and treated with 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 20 min. Cells were plated at a density of 65,000 cells/cm 2 on poly-D-lysine-coated 35 mm dishes (Costar). Cultures were infected with lentiviruses (300 μl condition medium per well in a 24-well plate) expressing at 2 DIV for 72 hr. Infected neurons were cultured until 13-15 DIV for further biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and imaging analyses. Lentiviruses were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (CRL-11268, ATCC) with the respective pFUGW vectors and two helper plasmids (pVSVg and pCMVΔ8.9) using FUGENE 6 (Roche), as previously described 33 . Condition medium containing viruses were harvested 48 hr after transfection, and were spun (800g for 5 min) to remove HEK cell debris before adding to the neuronal culture.

Cultured neurons at 14 DIV were fixed with methanol (-20°C). Fixed cultures were then incubated with primary antibodies against synaptophysin (monoclonal; 1:200; Sigma) and microtubule-activated protein 2 (MAP2; polyclonal; 1:250; Sigma) for 1 hr at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBBS, the neurons were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 30 min. After washing, cultures were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector labs). Confocal microscopic analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. Identical acquisition settings were applied to all samples of the experiment. Images of neurons were collected with 40x oil-immersion objective lens. Images were analyzed in a genotype blind manner using the NIH Image/Image J program.

Whole-cell patch recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons at 13-15 DIV were performed at room temperature using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular device) with pCLAMP acquisition software. Synaptic transmission was elicited with a concentric focal stimulus electrode, and EPSCs were recorded with a patch electrode (3-5 MΩ) in whole-cell recording mode and filtered at 2 kHz. Pipette solution contained (in mM): 136.5 K-gluconate, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 9 NaCl, 17.5 KCl, 5 QX-314, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP (adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH). The extracellular solution was a HEPES-buffered saline containing (in mM): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 8 dextrose (pH 7.2).

Hippocampal neurons were loaded with Fura-2 AM (5 μM, 45 min at 37°C) (Molecular probes), and imaged with a Leica DMI6000 Microscope with 40X lens (numerical aperture 0.75). The method and parameters for in vitro calibration (invitrogen calibration kit, F-6774) were as described previously 34 . Imaging processing and data analysis were performed using LAS AF software (Leica). High concentrations of potassium were applied using an 8-channel gravity perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instrument).

For enrichment of synaptic vesicle (presynaptic) proteins, four adult cortices (3-month-old) were homogenized with a Dounce teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 0.32M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES pH 7.3, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. For the P2 fraction, crude homogenates were centrifuged at 800g twice to remove debris; the supernatant were centrifuged at 9200g; and the pellet was resuspended in 0.32M sucrose buffer. For the LP1 fraction, P2 synaptosomes were centrifuged at 10, 200g, resuspended in 0.32M sucrose buffer and hypotonically lysed in 9 volumes of water. The lysate were centrifuged at 25,000g, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 1% NP-40 to produce LP1. For the LP2 fraction, the supernatant from the LP1 purification step was centrifuged at 165,000g, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 1% NP-40.
