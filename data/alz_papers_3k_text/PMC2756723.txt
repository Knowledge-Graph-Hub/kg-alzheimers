# Title
Highly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling

# Abstract
Current neural induction protocols in human ES cells (hESCs) rely on embryoid body formation, stromal feeder co-culture, or selective survival conditions; each strategy displaying significant drawbacks such as poorly defined culture conditions, protracted differentiation and low yield. Here we report that the synergistic action of two inhibitors of SMAD signaling, Noggin and SB431542, is sufficient for inducing rapid and complete neural conversion of hESCs under adherent culture conditions. Temporal fate analysis reveals a transient FGF5 + epiblast-like stage followed by PAX6 + neural cells competent of rosette formation. Initial cell density determines the ratio of CNS versus neural crest progeny. Directed differentiation of human iPSCs into midbrain dopamine and spinal motoneurons confirm robustness and general applicability of the novel induction protocol. Noggin/SB431542 based neural induction should greatly facilitate the use of hESC and hiPSCs in regenerative medicine and disease modeling and obviate the need for stromal feeder or embryoid body based protocols.

## Materials and Methods
hESC (WA-09; passages 35–45) and IPS lines (iPS C14 , iPS C27 ; passages 4–10) were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts plated at 12–15,000 cells/cm 2 (MEFs, Globalstem). A medium of DMEM/F12, 20% knock-out serum replacement (Gibco), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 6ng/mL FGF-2 was changed daily. Cells were passaged using 6 U/mL of dispase in hESC media, washed and re-plated at a dilution of 1:5 to 1:10.

The cDNAs encoding hOct4, hSox2, hKlf4 and c-myc (purchased from Open Biosystems) were subcloned into self-inactivating lentiviral vectors driven by the human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. Lentiviral vector supernatants were produced by triple co-transfection of the plasmid DNA encoding the vector, pCMVΔR8.91 and pUCMD.G into 293T cells. Human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) purchased from ATCC (CCL-171) were seeded at 1.5×10 4 cells/cm 2 in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The following day the fibroblasts were transduced with equal amounts of supernatants of the four lentiviral vectors in the presence of 4 ug/ml polybrene for ∼16 hours. Six days after transduction, fibroblasts were harvested by trypsinization and plated at 2×10 4 cells per 60 mm dish on a feeder layer of mytomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CF-1). The next day, the medium was switched to hESC medium. The iPS lines were confirmed positive for Tra-1–81, Tra-1–60, SSEA-4 and Nanog by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. In both hiPSC clones all 4 vector-encoded transgenes were found to be silenced.

hESC cultures were disaggregated using accutase for 20 minutes, washed using hESC media and pre-plated on gelatin for 1 hour at 37°C in the presence of ROCK inhibitor to remove MEFs. The nonadherent hESC were washed and plated on matrigel at a density of 10,000–25,000 cells/cm 2 on matrigel (BD) coated dishes in MEF conditioned hESC media (CM) spiked with 10 ng/mL of FGF-2 and ROCK-inhibitor. Ideal cell density was found to be 18,000 cells/cm 2 . The ROCK inhibitor was withdrawn, and hESC were allowed to expand in CM for 3 days or until they were nearly confluent. The initial differentiation media conditions included knock out serum replacement (KSR) media with 10 nM TGF-b inhibitor (SB431542, Tocris) and 500 ng/mL of Noggin (R&D). Upon day 5 of differentiation, the TGF-b inhibitor was withdrawn and increasing amounts of N2 media (25%, 50%, 75%) was added to the KSR media every two days while maintaining 500 ng/mL of Noggin. For MS5 induction, established methods previously reported were used 22 .

Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For each sample, 1 ug of total RNA was treated for DNA contamination and reverse transcribed using the Quantitect RT kit (Qiagen). Amplified material was detected using Quantitect SYBR green probes and PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Mastercycler RealPlex2 (Eppendorf). All results were normalized to a HPRT control and are from 4–6 technical replicates of 2–3 independent biological samples at each data point.

Dopaminergic patterning was initiated using BDNF, ascorbic acid, sonic hedgehog, and FGF8 in N2 media as previously reported 22 , and maturation was performed in the presence of BDNF, ascorbic acid, GDNF, TGFb-1, and cyclic-AMP. Motoneuron patterning was performed using BDNF, ascorbic acid, sonic hedgehog, and retinoic acid in N2 media as previously reported 18 .

Tissue was fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, washed with PBS, permeablized using .5% Triton X in PBS, and blocked using 1% BSA in PBS. Primary antibodies used for microscopy included PAX6 (Covance), Oct4 (Biovision), AP2 (Novus Biologicals), GBX2 (Sigma), HNK1 (Sigma), HOXB4 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)), Nestin (R&D), NKX6.1 (DSHB), OTX2 (gift), p75 (Advanced Target Systems.), PAX7 (DSHB), PLZF (Calbiochem), TUJ1 (Covance), ZO1 (Zymed), BF1 (FOXG1, gift Esseng Lai), TH (Sigma), HB9 (DSHB), ISL1 (DSHB). CD105-PE (eBioscience) was used for excluding MS5 stromal cells for flow cytometery on a FACScan (BD).
