# Title
Common variants at 7p21 are associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions

# Abstract
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of presenile dementia. The predominant neuropathology is FTLD with TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) inclusions (FTLD-TDP) 1 . FTLD-TDP is frequently familial resulting from progranulin ( GRN ) mutations. We assembled an international collaboration to identify susceptibility loci for FTLD-TDP, using genome-wide association (GWA). We found that FTLD-TDP associates with multiple SNPs mapping to a single linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on 7p21 that contains TMEM106B in a GWA study (GWAS) on 515 FTLD-TDP cases. Three SNPs retained genome-wide significance following Bonferroni correction; top SNP rs1990622 ( P= 1.08×10 −11 ; odds ratio (OR) minor allele (C) 0.61, 95% CI 0.53-0.71). The association replicated in 89 FTLD-TDP cases (rs1990622; P= 2×10 −4 ). TMEM106B variants may confer risk by increasing TMEM106B expression. TMEM106B variants also contribute to genetic risk for FTLD-TDP in patients with GRN mutations. Our data implicate TMEM106B as a strong risk factor for FTLD-TDP suggesting an underlying pathogenic mechanism.

## METHODS
Individuals of European descent with dementia clinically +/− motor neuron disease (MND) and an autopsy diagnosis of FTLD-TDP confirmed by TDP-43 IHC were included. Mixed pathologies were not excluded. Living individuals with a pathogenic GRN mutation were also included 18 . Only a single proband per family was permitted. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. 598 unique FTLD-TDP cases met inclusion criteria; 515 were used for the GWAS after PCA matching to controls. Characteristics described in Supplementary Table 1 . Whole genome amplification (WGA), performed in duplicate and pooled, was used for 15 (Repli-g Mini, Qiagen), but only 6 cases ultimately passed quality control parameters for the GWAS. The replication, using SNP genotyping, included cases of insufficient quality or quantity for the GWA phase (n=27), cases available only as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (n=6), and cases randomly not used for GWA phase (n=56). Three FTLD-TDP cases with mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene were included (two in GWA and one in replication) 18 .

GWAS controls consisted of 2509 samples, including 1297 self-reported Caucasian children of European ancestry recruited from CHOP Health Care Network and 1212 samples from the 1958 birth cohort genotyped by the WTCCC 27 . Although the controls were not selected for absence of neurodegenerative disease, the large size of the cohort relative to the low population frequency of FTLD overrides this potential concern. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies at the 7p21 loci are very similar (<1-2% variation) between CHOP and WTCCC cohorts suggesting they accurately reflect the control allelic frequencies in the general population ( Supplementary Table 9 ). To reduce the risk of population stratification all internal controls were screened using the STRUCTURE package 19 at 220 AIMs. To improve clustering the samples were spiked with 90 CEPH, Yoruban and Chinese/Japanese individuals genotyped as part of the HapMap project. Cases were excluded if their inferred proportion of ancestry was less than 90% that of the CEU cluster.

For the replication 553 controls were as follows: 275 from Coriell Institute (Neurologically Normal Caucasian control panels, Camden, NJ), 155 clinical controls from neurology clinics at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), 28 brain samples of neurologically normal individuals > 60 years from the UPenn Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and 95 population controls from CHOP.

Samples sent as DNA from external sites were extracted using different methods. Remaining samples (376) were extracted at UPenn from frozen brain tissue or blood. Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue (50 mg) by the Qiagen MagAttract DNA Mini M48 Kit on the M48 BioRobot. Genomic DNA was purified from whole blood using FlexiGene kit (Qiagen). High quality DNA was required for the Illumina genotyping. All DNA samples were evaluated for purity by spectrophotometric analysis (Nanodrop) and for degradation by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen).

Autopsy cases were confirmed to have TDP-43 pathology by IHC performed by the sending institution or at UPenn CNDR as previously described 16 . TDP-43 negative cases were excluded.

To stratify the analysis according to GRN mutation status, exons 1-13 (with exon 1 representing exon 0 in Gass et al. 10 ) and adjacent intronic regions were sequenced as described 13 in cases not previously evaluated. GRN sequencing was not possible due to limited sample quantity in a few cases (n=13 in GWA, n=15 in replication). Novel variants identified in this study not predicted to cause a frameshift or premature termination and previously described variants of uncertain significance were grouped with GRN mutation negative cases. The most common mutations identified are given in Supplementary Table 1 .

The FTLD-TDP cases and CHOP control samples were genotyped on either the Illumina HH550 BeadChip or the Illumina human610-quad BeadChip at the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP as previously described 14 . The 1958 birth cohort samples were genotyped on the HH550 BeadChip by the WTCCC 27 . Sixteen individuals, 13 cases and 3 controls, were excluded from GWA phase for low genotyping (<98% chip-wide genotyping success). We further rejected 13,316 SNPs with call rates <95%, 23,552 SNPs with MAF < 1% and 1,940 SNPs with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium P <10 −5 in the controls samples; the λ was 1.05. Cases and controls were screened for relatedness using the IBS estimations in plink ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/index.shtml ) on 100,000 randomly distributed markers throughout the genome. Pairwise Pi-hat values in excess of 0.01 were indicative of relatedness.

Following the quality control measures cases were matched to controls by ‘genetic matching’ as previously described 21 . We computed principal components for our dataset by running smartpca, a part of the EIGENSTRAT package, on 100,000 random autosomal SNPs and applied a matching algorithm implemented in MATLAB to the output. The matching algorithm assigns each sample a coordinate based on k eigenvalue-scaled principal components. It then matches each case to m unique controls within a distance d, keeping only cases that match exactly m controls. The distance thresholds were manually optimized to minimize λ and maximize power (i.e. number of cases). We matched each case to four controls, using the first three principal components and a distance threshold of 0.025.

Statistical tests for association were performed using plink . Single marker analyses for the genome-wide data were done using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The genomic inflation factors were 1.05 for the complete case set and 1.03 for the GRN mutation carriers, indicating only minor background stratification. The Breslow-Day test within plink was used to test for heterogeneity of odds ratio for the disease/SNP association between GRN mutation carriers and non-carriers. Conditional SNP regression analyses were completed in plink, the allele dosages of the conditioning SNP were included as covariates in the logistic regression models. To determine if the association at the TMEM106B locus was dependent on family history we included family history status as a covariate in a logistic regression model using plink . Haplotypes were reconstructed and population frequencies estimated using the EM algorithm implemented in the program fastPHASE 28 . For the age of onset and disease duration analyses we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the general linear models procedure in R ( www.r-project.org ). Independent variables for each ANOVA were the log transformed age of onset or disease duration in years and the individual SNP genotype with additive encoding (ie three categories where 0 is homozygous for the ancestral allele, 1 is heterozygous and 2 is homozygous for the minor allele). Power calculations were based on the rs1990622 allele frequencies observed for cases and controls in the GWAS, using a two-tailed test. We assumed that clinical FTLD cases without TDP-43 pathology as the neuropathological substrate would have allele frequencies similar to controls.

For the replication, genotyping was performed using TaqMan chemistry-based allelic discrimination assays (Applied Biosystems (ABI), Foster City, CA) on the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time System followed by analysis with SDS 7500 software v2.0.1. The ABI assays used were: rs1020004, C_7604953_10 and rs1990622, C_11171598_10. A nearby novel genetic variation (possible deletion) was found to interfere with correct genotyping of the T allele of SNP rs6966915 using ABI reagents C_31573289_10 (as well as by DNA sequencing), thus this SNP was not used further.

Frontal cortex human brain samples from the CNDR Brain Bank characterized following consensus criteria 1 , 3 were dissected as previously described 23 . Neurologically normal controls (n=7), FTLD-TDP cases with (n=8), and without (n=10) GRN mutations were sampled ( Supplementary Table 10 ). GRN mutations were confirmed to be absent from control cases. RNA quality was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RIN>6 for inclusion) as previously described 23 . mRNA expression was quantified by QRT-PCR on the ABI7500 using the delta-delta C T method, and the geometric mean of two housekeeping genes (β-actin and Cyclophilin A), shown to have stable expression in frontal cortex samples from FTLD-TDP and normal individuals 23 . Detailed information on primers is available on request.

For all brain expression and replication cohort analyses, statistical tests were performed using open source R software packages. R-scripts are available upon request. For evaluations of the effect of disease status, SNP genotype, and gender on TMEM106B expression, linear regressions were used to compute p-values in univariate models. We evaluated assumptions of linearity by checking QQ plots (observed vs. predicted under normal distribution). For pairwise comparisons within the linear models, risk allele homozygotes and GRN mutants, respectively, were designated the reference group for marginal t-tests evaluating genotype effects and the effects of GRN mutations on expression. Normalized gene expression sample genotype and gender data are provided in Supplementary Data 1 and 2 . For evaluations of the independent contributory effects of SNP genotype and TMEM106B expression on disease state, logistic regressions were used to compute AIC values in multivariate vs. univariate models ( Supplementary Table 4a ). For evaluations of the independent contributory effects of SNP genotype and disease state on TMEM106B expression, linear regressions were used in multivariate vs. univariate models ( Supplementary Table 4b ). For analyses of association of SNP genotypes with disease in our TaqMan replication cohort, Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to compute P -values under a codominant model.
