Neuroprotective effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in rodent and primate models of Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
Profound neuronal dysfunction in the entorhinal cortex contributes to early loss of short-term memory in Alzheimer’s disease 1 – 3 . Here we show broad neuroprotective effects of entorhinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) administration in several animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, with extension of therapeutic benefits into the degenerating hippocampus. In amyloid-transgenic mice, BDNF gene delivery, when administered after disease onset, reverses synapse loss, partially normalizes aberrant gene expression, improves cell signaling and restores learning and memory. These outcomes occur independently of effects on amyloid plaque load. In aged rats, BDNF infusion reverses cognitive decline, improves age-related perturbations in gene expression and restores cell signaling. In adult rats and primates, BDNF prevents lesion-induced death of entorhinal cortical neurons. In aged primates, BDNF reverses neuronal atrophy and ameliorates age-related cognitive impairment. Collectively, these findings indicate that BDNF exerts substantial protective effects on crucial neuronal circuitry involved in Alzheimer’s disease, acting through amyloid-independent mechanisms. BDNF therapeutic delivery merits exploration as a potential therapy for Alzheimer’s disease.

## METHODS
BL/6 transgenic mice expressed mutant APP under control of the Thy1 promoter 10 . We injected 2 µl lentivirus expressing BDNF or enhanced GFP into two sites spanning the midportion of the medial entorhinal cortex. Four weeks later, we tested the mice for 5 consecutive d in the Morris water maze (four morning and four afternoon trials daily; probe testing was not done after the last test trial).We tested visual and motoric sufficiency in a subsequent cued version of the water maze (visible platform), resulting in the exclusion of one sham subject. One week later, we assessed contextual fear conditioning with a 20-s tone that terminated with a 3-s footpad shock (0.45 mA). Twenty-four hours later, we reexposed each mouse to the same chamber and recorded freezing over 3 min. Two hours later, we placed the mice into novel chambers (new shape, odor and color) and recorded freezing for 3 min before and during each of three conditioned stimulus tone presentations (cued conditioning). We tracked the movements by infrared monitors. See the Supplementary Methods online for a description of stereological analyses and immunolabeling procedures. Experimental manipulations and data analysis in this and all subsequent studies were conducted in a blinded fashion. The University of California–San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) gave approval for mouse studies.

We gave aged cognitively impaired rats (Harlan, National Institute of Aging colony) one of the following treatments: BDNF protein infusion ( n = 10), vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) infusion ( n = 10) or sham surgery ( n = 10). Seven aged and cognitively unimpaired rats and 36 young rats did not receive infusions. We performed Morris water maze testing over four preoperative testing blocks, each consisting of six total trials (three trials per day, of a maximum duration of 90 s per trial). The last trial of each block consisted of a probe trial. Thirty of 37 aged rats were cognitively impaired, which we identified as inferior performance compared to the worst-scoring young rat on latency and distance measures during the fourth block. We then gave aged cognitively impaired rats continuous 4-week infusions (Alzet mini-pumps) of either 120 ng BDNF per day in artificial cerebrospinal fluid or artificial cerebrospinal fluid alone. Postoperative testing began 2 weeks later; we utilized four testing blocks of six trials per block. We used visible platform testing to assess visual and motoric adequacy, which showed no significant differences across groups (latency, P = 0.68; distance, P = 0.35).We performed western blotting for Erk, phosphorylated Erk (pErk), Akt and pAKT on entorhinal cortices from four BDNF-infused aged rats, four vehicle-infused aged rats, four nonoperated aged cognitively impaired rats, four nonoperated aged cognitively unimpaired rats and eight young rats. We normalized protein loading to Erk levels. Details of western blotting are in the Supplementary Methods . We used Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430_2 and Rat Genome 230_2 arrays per manufacturer instructions for microarray studies. We assessed quality by inter-array Pearson correlation and RNA degradation plotting. We performed contrast analysis of differential expression with the Linear Models of Microarray (LIMMA) software 38 .We analyzed pathway and gene ontology with Ingenuity. The Veterans Administration San Diego Healthcare System IACUC provided approval for the aging rat study and the perforant path rat study.

We cultured primary entorhinal cortex neurons from rats on postnatal day 3. We treated the cultured neurons with Aβ1–42 peptide (5 or 10 µM (gift from C. Glabe)) dissolved in DMSO. Control cultures received DMSO alone; scrambled Aβ had no cell toxic effect. We added BDNF or NGF (0, 0.5, 2.5 or 10 ng ml −1 ) concurrently with Aβ, and we assessed cell viability 24 h later with the LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes).

We injected 5 µl of lentivirus-BDNF-GFP (1.25 × 10 8 infectious units per ml) into three sites evenly distributed over the rostral-to-caudal extent of the right entorhinal cortex in adult Fischer rats (Harlan; n = 8); we injected lenti-GFP ( n = 6) or lentivirus encoding NGF ( n = 8) as controls. Four days later, we made right perforant path lesions. Two weeks later, we performed stereological counts of neurons in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex.

We gave six adult rhesus monkeys (California National Primate Research Center) perforant path lesions with a Radionics probe placed into the angular bundle, which we identified on preoperative magnetic resonance images. We then gave the monkeys injections of lentiviral vectors into the entorhinal cortex over four rostral-to-caudal sites expressing either BDNF ( n = 6) on one side of the brain and GFP ( n = 4) or no lentiviral injections ( n = 2) on the opposite side of the brain. We injected 20 µl of vector (5 × 10 8 infectious units per ml) per site at a rate of 1 µl min −1 . One month later, we quantified the cells in layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex on Nissl-stained sections with StereoInvestigator (Microbrightfield) software (optical sampling frame 10%, z axis inclusion-exclusion zone 5% at section top and bottom). The University of California–Davis IACUC gave approval for the primate studies.

Before gene transfer, we trained all monkeys to criterion performance on a computerized visuospatial learning task 39 . Briefly, we showed the monkeys a stimulus, the computer screen became blank and, after a 2-s delay, three choice objects were presented. The monkey was required to choose the original object. 20 trials/session were presented over 20 consecutive sessions. Four aged monkeys then underwent lenti-BDNF injection into the entorhinal cortex at the same locations and doses used in the perforant path lesion study, and five monkeys received lenti-GFP. One month later, we reassessed cognitive performance daily over ten sessions. We compared each monkey’s change in performance to the postoperative session 1 baseline. We quantified entorhinal cortex layer II neuronal size by stereological methods.

We used Student’s t -tests to compare two groups, whereas we used analysis of variance with Fischer post hoc tests for multigroup comparisons. For gene array studies, we calculated a Bayesian estimate of differential expression after linear model fitting with a threshold for significance of P < 0.005 (Bayesian modified t -test).
