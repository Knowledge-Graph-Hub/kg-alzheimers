Genome-wide association study identifies variants atCLUandPICALMassociated with Alzheimer's disease, and shows evidence for additional susceptibility genes

# Abstract
We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease involving over 16,000 individuals. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the APOE locus (most significant SNP: rs2075650, p= 1.8×10 −157 ) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two novel loci: rs11136000 in the CLU or APOJ gene (p= 1.4×10 −9 ) and rs3851179, a SNP 5′ to the PICALM gene (p= 1.9×10 −8 ). Both novel associations were supported in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with AD in the combined dataset (rs11136000: p= 8.5×10 −10 , odds ratio= 0.86; rs3851179: p= 1.3×10 −9 , odds ratio= 0.86). We also observed more variants associated at p< 1×10 −5 than expected by chance (p=7.5×10 −6 ), including polymorphisms at the BIN1 , DAB1 and CR1 loci.

## Methods
The study comprised a Stage 1 discovery sample of 4,957 AD cases and 9,682 controls and a Stage 2 follow-up sample of 2,023 AD cases and 2,340 controls. See the Supplementary note for a complete description of the study subjects.

Genotyping was performed at the Sanger Institute, UK. 200ng of input DNA per sample were used and prepared for genotyping using the Illumina Infinium™ system (Illumina® Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Manufacturer's protocols were followed throughout. The Illuminus algorithm for cluster analysis was used for genotype calling 49 .

4,113 AD cases and 1,602 controls were genotyped on the Illumina 610-quad chip as part of this study (the 610 group). In addition, 844 AD cases and 8,080 controls previously genotyped using either the Illumina HumanHap550 or Illumina HumanHap300 were included in the analysis. These genotypes were generated as part of 7 different studies, making 8 separate groups in total: 1) 610; 2) Mayo; 3) 1958 birth cohort (Sanger); 4) 1958 birth cohort (T1DGC); 5) ALS control; 6) Coriell control; 7) Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study; 8) KORA F4. As we used genotype data from multiple sources, it was important to apply stringent QC filters, as differential genotyping error rates between groups could result in spurious associations when the data are combined 50 , 51 . These filters were applied separately to each of these 8 groups to remove poorly performing samples using tools implemented in PLINK v1.05 52 .

We removed 1,469 individuals with missing genotype rates > 0.01. We also applied a filter based on mean autosomal heterozygosity, excluding 578 individuals with values above or below empirically determined thresholds. 71 individuals with inconsistencies between reported gender and genotype-determined gender and 22 individuals with ambiguous genotype-determined gender were removed. All individuals passing these QC filters were examined for potential genetic relatedness by calculating identity by descent (IBD) estimates for all possible pairs of individuals in PLINK, and removing one of each pair with an IBD estimate ≥ 0.125 (the level expected for first cousins). IBD estimates were calculated using SNPs that were common to the Illumina 610, 550 and 300 chips with a genotype missing data rate ≤ 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg P ≥ 1×10 −5 and a minor allele frequency ≥ 0.01. As a result, 506 individuals were excluded (note that this includes 311 individuals that were included in both the Coriell and ALS control group).

We also sought to detect non-European ancestry. To this end, genotype data from SNPs typed in all cohorts was merged with genotypes at the same SNPs from 210 unrelated European (CEU), Asian (CHB and JPT) and Yoruban (YRI) samples from the HapMap project. Subsequent to removing SNPs in extensive regions of linkage disequilibrium (chr5:44-51.5 Mb; chr6: 25-33.5 Mb; chr8: 8-12 Mb; chr11: 45-57 Mb) 53 , we further pruned SNPs if any pair within a 50-SNP window had r 2 > 0.2. Genome-wide average identity by state (IBS) distance was calculated in PLINK between each pair of individuals in the resulting dataset, based on 57,966 SNPs (all with a genotype missing data rate ≤ 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg P ≥ 1×10 −5 and a minor allele frequency ≥ 0.01). The resulting matrix of IBS distances was used as input for classical multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) in R v2.7.1. When the first two dimensions were extracted and plotted against each other, three clusters were observed corresponding to the European, Asian and Yoruban samples. Sixteen samples appeared to be ethnic outliers from the European cluster and were excluded from further analysis.

We assessed population structure within the data using principal components analysis (PCA) as implemented in EIGENSTRAT 54 to infer continuous axes of genetic variation. Eigenvectors were calculated based on the previously described LD-pruned subset of 57,966 SNPs common to all arrays. The EIGENSTRAT program also identifies genetic outliers, which are defined as individuals whose ancestry is at least 6 standard deviations from the mean on one of the top ten axes of variation. As a result, 188 outliers were identified and excluded. Following sample QC 3,941 AD cases and 7,848 controls were included in the analysis.

Due to unresolved genotype-calling issues with a proportion of SNPs on the sex chromosomes, only autosomal SNPs were included in this analysis (with the exception of rs5984894, an X chromosome SNP that has previously been associated with AD by Carrasquillo et al . 5 ; see Supplementary Table 5 ). Individuals were genotyped on either the Illumina 610-quad as part of this project, or were previously genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 or the Illumina HumanHap300 array, and the genotypes made available to us. Note that SNPs had already been filtered out of some groups prior to inclusion in this study. Moreover, where different versions of the same array were used ( e.g. HumanHap550v1 used to genotype the 1958 birth cohort (Sanger) cohort compared with the HumanHap550v3 array used to genotype the 1958 birth cohort (T1DGC)), only SNPs common to both versions were considered as present on that array. As such, SNPs included in our analysis fell into 4 different categories; 1) 266,714 SNPs common to all 3 arrays and genotyped in all individuals; 2) 202,516 SNPs common to the 610 and 550 arrays, but not present or without genotypes in individuals typed on the 300 array; 3) 7,744 SNPs common to the 610 and 300 arrays, but not present or without genotypes in individuals typed on the 550 array; 4) 105,614 SNPs with genotypes only in the 610 data.

We assessed the effects of different missing data rate and Hardy-Weinberg filters, aiming to remove poorly performing SNPs without excluding markers that may show genuine association with AD. For each of the 4 SNP categories, markers were excluded if they had a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 or a Hardy-Weinberg P ≤ 1×10 −5 , in either cases or controls. SNPs with a MAF ≥ 0.05 were excluded if they had a genotype missing rate of > 0.03 in either cases or controls; for SNPs with a MAF between 0.01 and 0.05, a more stringent genotype missing rate threshold of 0.01 was employed. As a result of this basic SNP QC 43,542 SNPs were excluded.

Ten principal components (PCs) were extracted using EIGENSTRAT, as previously described. To determine if the PCs could assuage any population structure within our sample, we performed logistic regression tests of association with AD, sequentially including between 0 and 10 of the top PCs as covariates. The impact of including the PCs was evaluated by calculating the genomic control inflation factor, λ 11 . We found that including the first 4 PCs as covariates had the maximum impact on λ.

To minimize inter-chip and inter-cohort differences that could result in an inflation of type I error rate, minor allele frequencies were compared between controls in the different groups using logistic regression analysis, incorporating the top 4 PCs as covariates as previously described. Comparisons were only performed between individuals from the same geographical region ( i.e. British Isles, Germany or USA). For each of the 4 categories of SNPs, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot was produced for each cohort control comparison, and the significance threshold employed to exclude SNPs was based on where the observed χ 2 statistics departed from the null expectation. A further 9,828 SNPs were excluded as a result of these comparisons. Thus, a total of 529,218 autosomal SNPs were analyzed for association with AD in this study.

SNPs were tested for association with AD using logistic regression, assuming an additive model. Covariates were included in the logistic regression analysis to allow for geographical region and chip, i.e. to distinguish between 1) individuals from the British Isles, 2) individuals from Germany, 3) individuals from the US typed on the 610 or 550 chip, 4) individuals from the US typed on the 300 chip. It was not possible to include a covariate for each chip as only controls were genotyped on the 550 chip. Similarly, it was not possible to include a covariate for each of the 8 groups, as only two included both cases and controls (610 and Mayo groups). The first 4 PCs extracted from EIGENSTRAT were also included as covariates, as previously described. Following analysis, 130 cluster plots were visually inspected for SNPs with a p-value ≤ 1×10 −4 . Thirteen SNPs showing poorly formed clusters were excluded. Thus our analysis was based on 529,205 SNPs, and a conservative genome-wide significance threshold of 0.05/529205 = 9.4×10 −8 was employed. The overall genomic control inflation factor, λ, was calculated to be 1.037. Population attributable risk (the expected reduction in disease load following removal of a risk factor) was calculated for GWS SNPs according to the formula: PAR = F con (OR-1)/[F con (OR-1)+1], where F con is the frequency of the risk allele in controls and OR is the odds ratio associated with the risk allele 55 .

We assessed our results to determine if we observed more significant SNPs than would be expected by chance. We first removed SNPs within 500 kb either side of risk SNPs, i.e. rs429358 (the APOE ε4 SNP), rs11136000 ( CLU ) and rs3851179 ( PICALM ). We thus excluded 170 “ APOE” SNPs, 290 “ CLU” SNPs and 257 “ PICALM” SNPs. Of the 528,448 remaining SNPs we estimated 397,224.7 “independent” tests using the algorithm we described in 56 . Of 16 SNPs significant at a significance level α=10 −5 (excluding APOE , CLU and PICALM SNPs, see Table 2 ) we estimated 12.6 “independent” tests. We calculated the mean (N*α =397224.7*10 −5 ≈ 4.0) and variance (N*α*(1-α) = 3.97) of the expected number of significant tests at α=10 −5 level using the binomial distribution. Thus the probability of observing 12.6 significant tests is P = 7.5×10 −6 .

We genotyped SNPs in cases and controls from 5 European cohorts (described in Supplementary Table 3 ). Putative functional SNPs were identified using PupaSuite 57 . Genotyping was performed at Cardiff using the MassARRAY and iPlexGOLD systems (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. All genotyped SNPs had genotype call frequency rates >90% in the follow-up sample, and no SNPs had HWE P-value ≤ 0.05 in cases or controls. SNPs were tested for association with AD using logistic regression, assuming an additive model. Covariates were included in the logistic regression analysis to allow for each cohort, i.e. 1) Belgium, 2) MRC, 3) ART, 4) Bonn, 5) Greek.

We included genotype data from stages 1 and 2 in a meta-analysis for SNPs at the CLU and PICALM loci. In addition, we employed genotype data from the TGEN study and the Li et al . study, two publicly available AD GWAS datasets. The TGEN sample is comprised of 861 AD cases and 550 controls genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K chip. The Li et al . discovery sample is comprised of 753 AD cases and 736 controls also genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K chip. If a SNP of interest was not genotyped in our GWAS or the TGEN dataset, an attempt was made to impute genotypes in PLINK, using the 60 HapMap CEU founders as a reference panel. Only imputed SNPs with an information content metric value greater than 0.8 were included in analysis (see PLINK website). Individual level data were not available for the Li study and so SNPs could not be imputed. Where individual level data was available, SNPs were tested for association with AD using logistic regression, assuming an additive model. Covariates were included in the logistic regression analysis to allow for geographical region and chip as in Stage 1 and for cohort as in Stage 2. Covariates included for the TGEN sample distinguished between samples from the Netherlands Brain Bank and samples from the USA. Meta-analyses incorporating data from the Li et al . study are based on Mantel-Haenzsel χ 2 tests. Results of the meta-analysis are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4 .

We also tested the GWS SNPs for relationships with age at onset (AAO). To this end, age at onset (in years) was employed as the dependent variable in a linear regression analysis and an additive model was assumed. AAO data was available for 2,856 AD cases. Covariates were included in the logistic regression analysis to allow for geographical region and chip, i.e. to distinguish between 1) cases from the British Isles, 2) cases from Germany, 3) cases from the US typed on the 610 chip, 4) cases from the US typed on the 300 chip.

In addition, we stratified our sample based on presence/absence of at least 1 APOE ε4 allele. We had APOE genotype data for 6045 individuals; our ε4-positive sample consisted of 2,203 AD cases and 632 controls; our ε4-negative sample consisted of 1,446 cases and 1,764 controls. We performed genome-wide tests for association with AD in each sub-sample, but no SNP achieved genome-wide significance (see Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 ).
