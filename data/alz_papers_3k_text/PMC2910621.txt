Evidence for Novelβ-Sheet Structures in Iowa Mutantβ-Amyloid Fibrils†

# Abstract
Asp23-to-Asn mutation within the coding sequence of β -amyloid, called the Iowa mutation, is associated with early onset, familial Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, in which patients develop neuritic plaques and massive vascular deposition predominantly of the mutant peptide. We examined the mutant peptide, D23N-A β 40, by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. D23N-A β 40 forms fibrils considerably faster than the wild-type peptide ( k = 3.77 × 10 -3 min -1 and 1.07 × 10 -4 min -1 for D23N-A β 40 and the wild-type peptide WT-A β 40, respectively) and without a lag phase. Electron microscopy shows that D23N-A β 40 forms fibrils with multiple morphologies. X-ray fiber diffraction shows a cross- β pattern, with a sharp reflection at 4.7 Å and a broad reflection at 9.4 Å, which is notably smaller than the value for WT-A β 40 fibrils (10.4 Å). Solid-state NMR measurements indicate molecular level polymorphism of the fibrils, with only a minority of D23N-A β 40 fibrils containing the in-register, parallel β -sheet structure commonly found in WT-A β 40 fibrils and most other amyloid fibrils. Antiparallel β -sheet structures in the majority of fibrils are indicated by measurements of intermolecular distances through 13 C- 13 C and 15 N- 13 C dipole-dipole couplings. An intriguing possibility exists that there is a relationship between the aberrant structure of D23N-A β 40 fibrils and the unusual vasculotropic clinical picture in these patients.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
WT-A β 40 (NH 2 -DAEFRHDSGY 10 EVHHQKLVFF 20 AEDVGSNKGA 30 IIGL MVG GVV 40 -COOH) was synthesized on a 0.25 mmol scale using modified 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) and HBTU/HOBT (Fastmoc) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A instrument. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using 9 mL of TFA plus 0.5 mL of thioanisole, 0.3 mL of EDT, and 0.2 mL of anisole for 1.5 h at 22 °C. Peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on a preparative C18 (Zorbax) column at 60 °C. Peptide purity was greater than 98% by analytical HPLC. The molecular mass of the peptide was verified by ESI and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. D23N-A β 40 was synthesized as above, except that Asn was put in place of the Asp residue at position 23.

For solid-state NMR, WT-A β 40 and D23N-A β 40 fibrils were prepared with 13 C and 15 N labels in various combinations, using isotopically labeled amino acids from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories. Solid-state NMR samples included WT-A β 40 with 15 N at Phe20, WT-A β 40 with 13 C at the Phe19 carbonyl, D23N-A β 40 with 13 C at the Ala21 methyl and Val36 carbonyl and 15 N at Leu17, D23N-A β 40 with 15 N at Phe20, D23N-A β 40 with 13 C at carbonyl sites of Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, or Ala21 carbonyl (five separate peptide samples), and D23N-A β 40 with uniform 15 N and 13 C labeling of Phe19, Glu22, Val24, Gly25, Lys28, Ile31, and Leu34. For rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) experiments, peptides with 15 N at Phe20 were mixed with peptides with 13 C at specific carbonyl sites in a 1:1 ratio before fibrillization. All syntheses were carried out with identical conditions, except that synthesis of D23N-A β 40 with uniformly labeled residues was performed on a 0.1 mmol scale. After purification, peptides were dissolved at ≈50 °C into 30:70 acetonitrile:water containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) and lyophilized as aliquots of 0.5 mg in siliconized 1.5 mL tubes and then stored at -20 °C.

To initiate fibrillogenesis, peptide was first dissolved in DMSO ( 20 ) and then diluted into 10 mM sodium phosphate, so that the final concentration of DMSO was ≤2% and the peptide concentration was approximately 100 μ M. To verify the peptide concentration used in fibrillogenesis assays, peptide concentration in buffer was assessed from absorbance at 274.6 nm, using the extinction coefficient for tyrosine of 1420 M -1 cm -1 . Peptides were incubated at 37 °C in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.40. Fibril formation was assessed at various times by taking 10 μ L aliquots, which were then diluted into 1 mL of 10 μ M thioflavin T solution in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.40. The sample was pipetted to disperse fibrils, and fluorescence was measured at λ EX = 446 nm and λ EM = 490 nm, using a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were made after a 3 s delay and were averaged for 10 s, using a bandwidth of 10 nm and a photomultiplier voltage of 700.

Images were recorded with an FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 80 kV. An aliquot of fibrillized peptide solution was diluted 5× in deionized water. A 10 μ L drop was adsorbed for 120 s to a glow-discharged carbon film, supported by lacey carbon on a 300 mesh copper TEM grid. The grid was blotted, rinsed twice with deionized water, stained with 10 μ L of 3% uranyl acetate for 30 s, then blotted, dried in air, and examined in the TEM.

For measurements of fibril diameter, 5 μ L aliquots of fibril slurries of A β D23N or wild-type A β peptides were applied to a glow-discharged, 1-400 mesh, carbon-coated support film, washed with water, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s. Micrographs were recorded using a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope at magnifications of 15000× and 98000×. In addition, the CCD camera added a magnification of 1.4× to all images. Fibril diameters were measured using the “measure” tool in Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software and calibrated using scale bars incorporated into the photomicrographs. Four hundred separate measurements were made on micrographs of each type of fibril. For making histograms of the diameters, the appropriate number of bins, k , was estimated by the relationship k = min{sqrt( n ), 10 ln( n )/ln(10)}, where n is the sample size, i.e., 400. From this calculation, the appropriate bin size was found to be ~0.6-0.8 nm. A similar number was also obtained using the Scott criterion: W = 3.49 σ N − 1 ∕ 3 where W = optimal bin size, σ is the standard deviation, and N is the number of determinations ( 34 ). As will be described below, the histogram of fibril diameters appeared to have modes corresponding to two, somewhat skewed Gaussian distributions. From the means and standard deviations of the two Gaussians, a theoretical curve for the Gaussians was calculated using the relationship: 1 σ 2 π exp ( − ( x − μ ) 2 2 σ 2 ) where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

Fibrils of D23N-A β 40 and WT-A β 40 were made in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.40, as described above. Salt was removed from the fibril samples by dialysis against water, using Spectra/Por CE MWCO 500. After centrifugation of the fibrils for 30 min at 13200 g , the supernatant was removed, and the fibril slurry in the precipitate was put into 0.7 mm glass capillaries (Charles Supper). To distinguish between equatorial and meridional reflections, the capillary was placed inside a 11.7 T NMR magnet for 5 days to achieve partial alignment of the fibrils ( 35 , 36 ). After magnetic alignment, the fibrils formed a band with their longitudinal axis parallel to the long axis of the capillary tube. The orientation of the fibrils was determined by inspection of the fibrils by light and electron microscopy.

Synchrotron data were collected at Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source beamline BioCAT (insertion device station) on a CCD-based X-ray detector (PCCD 168080, / Aviex/ L.L.C), where the X-ray wavelength was 1.03 Å. The sample-to-detector distance was 100 mm. X-ray diffraction data were analyzed with FIT2D ( http://www.esrf.fr/computing/expg/subgroups/data_analysis/FIT2D ). Background images were collected for the same exposure times (2 s) as the sample data collection and subtracted using the “subtraction” function of FIT2D, and the rotation (Azimuth) scans were performed with the “cake” d-scan function of FIT2D.

Fibrils were grown as described above for at least 8 days. Both thioflavin T measurements and TEM images were taken to monitor fibril growth. Fibrils were then dialyzed against Milli-Q water, using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff of 500, and centrifuged at 13200 rpm for 30 min in siliconized Eppendorf tubes. Pellets were resuspended in a total of 400 μ L of the supernatant and then centrifuged again (13200 rpm, 30 min). The final pellet was flash frozen, and the sample was lyophilized. Lyophilized samples (approximately 5 mg each) were packed into 3.2 mm magic angle spinning (MAS) rotors with Teflon spacers to contain the samples in the center of the NMR solenoid coil. For certain experiments, samples were rehydrated within the MAS rotors by addition of 10 mM phosphate buffer (approximately 1 μ L/mg of fibrils). One sample of 15 N-Phe20-labeled D23N-A β 40 fibrils was prepared by centrifugation of the wet fibril pellet directly into the MAS rotor, without lyophilization.

Solid-state NMR measurements were performed at 9.4 T (100.4 MHz 13 C NMR frequency, 40.5 MHz 15 N NMR frequency) and 14.1 T (150.7 MHz 13 C NMR frequency, 60.7 MHz 15 N NMR frequency), using three-channel 3.2 mm MAS probes (Varian) and Varian InfinityPlus spectrometer consoles. One-dimensional (1D) spectra were obtained with standard cross-polarization and two-pulse phase modulated (TPPM) proton decoupling ( 37 ) with proton radio-frequency (rf) field strengths of 100-120 kHz. Measurements of 13 C- 13 C dipole-dipole couplings were performed at 9.4 T and 20.00 kHz MAS frequency, using the PITHIRDS-CT recoupling technique ( 38 ) or the fpRFDR-CT recoupling technique ( 3 , 39 ) as previously described. Measurements of 15 N- 13 C dipole-dipole couplings were performed at 14.1 T and 7.50 kHz MAS frequency, using a version of 13 C-detected REDOR ( 40 , 41 ) in which one π pulse per MAS rotation period was applied to both the 13 C (at the beginning of each period) and the 15 N (in the middle of each period) channels. 13 C NMR signals without 15 N- 13 C dephasing (S 0 signals) and with 15 N- 13 C dephasing (S 1 signals) differed only by the application of a single 15 N π pulse at the midpoint of the REDOR pulse sequence. Rf pulses were actively synchronized with an MAS tachometer signal in PITHIRDS-CT, fpRFDR-CT, and REDOR measurements. 13 C and 15 N π pulse lengths were 10.0 and 12.0 μ s, respectively. Frequency-selective REDOR (fsREDOR) measurements were performed at 14.1 T, using the technique of Jaroniec et al. ( 42 ) as previously described ( 19 ).

The sensitivity of REDOR (except as noted below) and fpRFDR-CT measurements was enhanced by pulsed spin-locking (PSL) ( 43 ), a technique that increases the signal-to-noise ratio by removing inhomogeneous broadening and resonance offsets during detection of 13 C NMR signals. Typically, PSL reduces experimental measurement times by factors of 10-30, enabling measurements that would otherwise be precluded by low signal-to-noise ratio. However, signal components with small 13 C chemical shift differences cannot be resolved under PSL detection.

Two-dimensional (2D) 13 C- 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T, either at 21.5 kHz MAS frequency with finite-pulse radio-frequency-driven recoupling (fpRFDR) ( 44 , 45 ) and 15.0 μ s 13 C π pulses for 2.322 ms during the mixing period or at 19.0 kHz MAS with rf-assisted diffusion (RAD) ( 46 , 47 ) for 500 ms during the mixing period.

13 C chemical shifts are relative to tetramethylsilane, using the carbonyl signal of l -alanine powder at 177.95 ppm as an external reference. 15 N chemical shifts are relative to liquid NH 3 , using a ratio of 0.4029075 between the NH 3 and l -alanine NMR frequencies.

## RESULTS
The kinetics of fibrillogenesis of D23N-A β 40, monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence, are shown in Figure 1A . Fibril formation by D23N-A β 40 shows no obvious lag period, even when fluorescence was monitored within the first hour of peptide incubation. Data in Figure 1A are well fit by the expression F ( t )= F (0) + [ F (∞) - F (0)][1 - exp(-( kt ) n )], with n = 1 and k = 3.77 × 10 -3 min -1 . As described previously ( 20 ), kinetics of WT-A β 40 fibrillogenesis can be fit to the same form, but with n = 2.24±0.37 and k = 1.07 × 10 -4 min -1 . With n > 1, this expression is a stretched exponential, with a lag period that precedes the onset of fluorescence enhancement. These results are in reasonable agreement with earlier observations of van Nostrand et al. ( 22 ), who observed more rapid fibril formation by D23N-A β 40 than by WT-A β 40.

Lactam cross-linking of D23 and K28 side chains in WT-A β 40 has been shown previously to eliminate the lag period in thioflavin T fluorescence measurements ( 20 ), suggesting that constraining the conformation of residues 23-28 greatly accelerates fibril nucleation or fibril growth. Apparently, the D23N substitution has a similar effect, perhaps also by restricting the conformational freedom in residues 23-28.

Panels B-D of Figure 1 show negatively stained TEM images of D23N-A β 40 fibrils. These fibrils have diameters, lengths, and the straight, unbranched appearance that are typical of amyloid fibrils. Close examination of the images reveals coexistence of several structures, including fibrils with an apparent, approximately periodic twist (single-headed arrows) and fibrils that lack an apparent twist (double-headed arrows). Untwisted fibrils occur either as single filaments or as what appear to be laterally associated pairs of filaments. Similar twisted and untwisted structures have been described previously for WT-A β 40 fibrils and have been shown to arise from distinct molecular structures ( 6 , 7 , 16 ). From these images of D23N-A β 40 fibrils, there appear to be at least two distinct molecular structures for D23N-A β 40 fibrils, corresponding to the twisted and untwisted morphologies. Coexistence of more than two D23N-A β 40 fibril structures in our samples is not inconsistent with the TEM images, as neither the twisted nor the untwisted fibrils are clearly structurally homogeneous.

The diameters of D23N-A β 40 fibrils also showed heterogeneity, with two distinct modes in the histograms of fibril diameters ( Supporting Information Figure 1 ). The minority population of D23N-A β 40 fibrils had a mean diameter of 11.20 ± 1.42 nm (mean ± SD), approximately the same as wild-type A β 40 fibrils (11.15 ± 0.85 nm, mean ± SD). The majority of D23N-A β 40 fibrils, however, were consistently smaller, with diameters of 6.90 ± 2.26 nm (mean ± SD).

Figure 2 compares X-ray fiber diffraction patterns of partially aligned D23N-A β 40 ( Figure 2A ) and WT-A β 40 ( Figure 2B ) fibrils. A “cross- β ” diffraction pattern is observed in both cases, i.e., a sharp, meridional reflection at 4.7 Å, at right angles to a broad equatorial reflection of roughly 10 Å. The equatorial reflection for D23N-A β 40 fibrils has its maximum at 9.4 Å, while that of WT-A β 40 fibrils has its maximum at 10.6 Å. This difference suggests a significant difference in fibril structure, specifically in the average spacing between layers of β -sheets.

Panels A and B of Figure 3 show 1D 13 C NMR spectra of D23N-A β 40 fibrils labeled with 13 C at the carbonyl site of Val36 and the methyl site of Ala21. In the rehydrated state (i.e., with phosphate buffer added to lyophilized fibrils in the MAS rotor), both the carbonyl and the methyl lines show three partially resolved components, suggesting coexistence of three distinct structural environments for Val36 and Ala21 in the fibril sample ( Figure 3A ). In the dry, lyophilized state, splittings of the carbonyl and methyl lines are not resolved ( Figure 3B ), due to the increased line widths that are commonly observed and attributed to greater static disorder in lyophilized fibrils ( 14 , 48 ). In view of the polymorphism in TEM images, the simplest explanation for these NMR signals is that three D23N-A β 40 fibril structures are present in the sample, with comparable abundances. We discount the alternative explanation that the three Val36 and Ala21 environments might be present within a single fibril structure on the grounds that a single fibril structure would not produce the observed variety of fibril morphologies in TEM images, especially as studies of WT-A β 40 fibrils have established clear connections between morphology in TEM images and underlying molecular structure. Other solid-state NMR data described below are also inconsistent with a single fibril structure. Although the possibility exists that one fibril structure might contain two distinct structural environments for Val36 and Ala21 (with another fibril structure containing one structural environment), all detailed structural models for amyloid fibrils that have been developed to date ( 7 , 12 , 19 , 49 ) have a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (i.e., a single structural environment). A fibril structure with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (i.e., two structural environments for D23N-A β 40 molecules within a single fibril) therefore seems unlikely.

Figure 3C shows the 13 C NMR spectrum of D23N-A β 40 fibrils prepared from a 1:1 mixture of peptides labeled with 13 C at the carbonyl site of Phe19 and peptides labeled with 15 N at Phe20. (Mixtures of 15 N- and 13 C-labeled peptides were used also for REDOR experiments to examine β -sheet register, as discussed below.) Again, the carbonyl NMR signal shows three partially resolved components in the rehydrated D23N-A β 40 fibrils. In contrast, the 13 C NMR spectrum of rehydrated WT-A β 40 fibrils prepared from a 1:1 mixture of peptides with the same isotopic labels ( Figure 3D ) does not show a splitting of the carbonyl NMR signal.

Figure 3E shows carbonyl regions of 13 C NMR spectra of D23N-A β 40 fibrils prepared from 1:1 mixtures of peptides labeled with 13 C at the carbonyl site of Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, or Ala21 and peptides labeled with 15 N at Phe20, recorded in the lyophilized state without rehydration. Line widths for carbonyl signals (full width at half-maximum, fwhm) range from 2.5 ppm (Ala21) to 5.0 ppm (Phe20). For comparison, carbonyl line widths for lyophilized WT-A β 40 fibrils with a single morphology are typically narrower, i.e., less than 2.5 ppm ( 6 ).

13 C chemical shifts for all carbonyl sites in Figure 3 are more than 1.0 ppm upfield from the corresponding random coil shifts ( 50 ), as expected for carbonyl sites in β -strand segments (see Table 1 ). 13 C chemical shifts for the Ala21 methyl site are more than 2.5 ppm downfield from the corresponding random coil shift, again as expected for alanines in β -strand segments. Thus, the 13 C chemical shifts for all D23N-A β 40 fibril structures in our samples are consistent with the strand-bend-strand conformational motif identified previously in WT-A β 40 fibrils ( 7 , 18 , 19 ).

Figure 4A shows 1D 15 N spectra of a D23N-A β 40 fibril sample that was 15 N-labeled at Phe20 and examined in a fully hydrated state, without lyophilization. Two resolved lines with an approximate 1:2 ratio of areas are observed, at 129.5 and 123.0 ppm. We attribute the weaker 15 N line to one of the three fibril structures indicated by the 13 C NMR data in Figure 3 and the stronger line to the other two structures, although we cannot make specific correlations between the 15 N and the 13 C signals from available data. A similar spectrum is observed for rehydrated fibrils labeled with 15 N at Phe20 and 13 C at the Phe19 carbonyl site (1:1 peptide mixture, Figure 4B ). Similar spectra are also observed for lyophilized fibrils ( Figure 4D ), although the 15 N NMR lines are somewhat broader in the lyophilized state. Area ratios for the two components range from 1.3:1 to 2.0:1, attributable to variations in the relative proportions of different D23N-A β 40 fibril structures. The fact that significant variations in these area ratios are observed supports the interpretation that different signal components are associated with different fibril structures. In contrast, the 15 N spectrum of WT-A β 40 fibrils labeled with 15 N at Phe20 ( Figure 4C ) shows a single sharp line at 127.0 ppm.

Panels A and B of Figure 5 show 13 C NMR spectra of rehydrated D23N- A β 40 fibrils with 13 C labels at the Ala21 methyl and Val36 carbonyl sites, recorded as a function of the effective 13 C- 13 C dipolar evolution time τ D in PITHIRDS-CT measurements of intermolecular 13 C- 13 C dipole-dipole couplings. The PITHIRDS-CT and fpRFDR-CT techniques are quite similar, and the resulting data are nearly identical, although the more recently developed PITHIRDS-CT technique involves a somewhat simpler rf pulse sequence ( 38 ). In addition, the PITHIRDS-CT measurements were performed without PSL, so that the signal components arising from different D23N-A β 40 fibril structures remain resolved. In both the Ala21 and Val36 data, only one of the signal components decays on the 30 ms time scale expected for intermolecular dipole-dipole couplings in an inregister, parallel β -sheet ( 3 , 6 - 9 , 12 ). Comparison with numerical simulations in Figure 5C indicates intermolecular distances of approximately 0.5 nm for the rapidly decaying signal components (labeled c and d in Figure 5 ) and distances greater than 0.7 nm for the other components. These data show that only approximately one-third of the D23N-A β 40 fibrils in this sample, probably representing one of three coexisting fibril structures, have the inregister, parallel β -sheets identified in all previous studies of full-length β -amyloid peptide fibrils ( 3 , 5 - 7 , 10 , 19 ). The remaining D23N-A β 40 fibrils have an anomalous β -sheet structure.

Figure 5D shows 13 C- 13 C dipole-dipole coupling measurements for lyophilized D23N-A β 40 fibrils labeled with 15 N at Phe20 and 13 C at the indicated carbonyl sites (1:1 mixtures), obtained with the fpRFDR-CT technique ( 3 , 39 ). Data in Figure 5D were obtained with PSL, so that signal components from different fibril structures were not resolved. These data show that the majority of fibrils have intermolecular distances for Val18, Phe19, Phe20, and Ala21 carbonyl sites that are roughly 0.7 nm or greater. From these data alone, it is not possible to determine whether one D23N-A β 40 fibril structure has in-register, parallel β -sheets.

Figure 6A shows measurements of intermolecular 15 N- 13 C dipole-dipole couplings (i.e., 15 N- 13 C distances) between Phe20 amide sites and carbonyl sites of Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, and Ala21 in D23N-A β 40 fibrils prepared from 1:1 mixtures of 15 N-labeled peptides and 13 C-labeled peptides, recorded with the REDOR technique ( 40 , 41 ). These are 13 C-detected REDOR measurements. Fibril samples were lyophilized, and PSL detection was required to enhance sensitivity, so that REDOR curves for different signal components were not resolved. Clear variations in the REDOR data for different positions of the 13 C labels are observed, with the most rapid rise of the normalized REDOR difference signal ΔS/S 0 , corresponding to the shortest 15 N- 13 C distances, occurring when the 13 C labels are at the Val18 carbonyl position. The longest 15 N- 13 C distances occur when the 13 C labels are at the Phe20 or Ala21 carbonyl position.

Solid lines in Figure 6B are simulated REDOR data for the five samples, assuming an in-register, parallel β -sheet structure with the idealized geometry shown in Figure 6C . The fact that the fibrils are prepared from 1:1 isotopic mixtures is taken into account by averaging simulations in which a given 13 C label (at one of the carbonyl positions on the middle chain in Figure 6C ) is coupled to two 15 N labels (on both the upper and lower chains in Figure 6C ), to one 15 N label (on either the upper or the lower chain), or to no 15 N labels. In addition, contributions of natural-abundance carbonyl 13 C nuclei to the REDOR data are taken into account by multiplying the averaged REDOR curves by 0.5 (since the number of deliberate carbonyl 13 C labels in these samples is nearly equal to the expected number of natural-abundance carbonyl 13 C nuclei).

In these experiments, all mixtures contain 15 N-Phe20 and one of five 1- 13 C-labeled amino acids: Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, or Ala21. Thus, for an in-register, parallel β -sheet, the shortest 15 N- 13 C distance from the 15 N label at Phe20 to a 13 C label occurs when the 13 C is at Phe19 (nearest-neighbor distances of 4.2 Å and 5.6 Å). That is, the backbone carbonyl group of residue n makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide group of residue n + 1 on a neighboring peptide chain. Experimental REDOR data for WT-A β 40 fibrils with labels at these positions are in excellent agreement with the idealized simulations for an in-register, parallel β -sheet ( Figure 6B ). On the other hand, experimental REDOR data for D23N-A β 40 fibrils do not agree with these simulations, again indicating anomalous β -sheet structures. The rapid rise of REDOR signals in Figure 6A for the D23N-A β 40 sample with 13 C at Val18 suggests the presence of β -sheets in which the Val18 carbonyl group of a given chain is hydrogen-bonded to the Phe20 amide group of a neighboring chain. Such hydrogen bonds might occur either in parallel β -sheets with a one-residue shift in hydrogen bond registry or in antiparallel β -sheets in which carbonyl groups of residue 17 + k are hydrogen-bonded to amide groups of residue 21 - k , with k being an integer. However, the shifted parallel β -sheet structure would also necessarily contain hydrogen bonds between the Phe20 carbonyl group of a given chain and the Phe20 amide group of a neighboring chain, so that there should be a strong REDOR signal for the D23N-A β 40 sample in which both Phe20 carbonyls and Phe20 amides are labeled, contrary to the experimental data in Figure 6A .

Dashed lines in Figure 6B are simulated REDOR data for an antiparallel β -sheet structure with the idealized geometry shown in Figure 6D and with 17 + k ↔ 21 - k hydrogen bonds. These simulations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental REDOR data for all five samples in Figure 6A . In particular, the strongest REDOR signal is for the Val18-labeled sample, followed by the Leu17- and Phe19-labeled samples. Phe20- and Ala21-labeled samples are predicted to have weak REDOR signals, as observed. Because all samples also contain a minor population of in-register, parallel β -sheet fibrils, exact agreement with antiparallel REDOR simulations is not expected. In structurally heterogeneous samples, experimental REDOR data may also be affected by differences in transverse nuclear spin relaxation rates among different fibril structures.

Further support for antiparallel β -sheets in D23N-A β 40 fibrils comes from REDOR measurements on rehydrated fibrils with 13 C labels at the Val36 carbonyl and Ala21 methyl sites and a 15 N label at the Leu17 amide site (same sample as in Figures 3A,B and 5A-C ), performed without PSL. As shown in Figure 7A , the two Ala21 methyl lines that do not decay rapidly in 13 C- 13 C PITHIRDS-CT measurements ( Figure 5 ), and hence do not arise from fibrils with in-register, parallel β -sheet structures, show significant 15 N- 13 C REDOR difference signals, indicating intermolecular proximity to Leu17. The other Ala21 methyl line does not show a significant REDOR difference signal. As a control, data in Figure 7B show the absence of REDOR difference signals for all Val36 carbonyl lines, as expected since Val36 should not be near Leu17 in either parallel or antiparallel β -sheets. Comparisons with REDOR simulations for ideal 17 + k ↔ 20 k , 17 + k ↔ 21 - k , and 17 + k ↔ 22 - k antiparallel β -sheet structures ( Figure 7C ) indicate that the Ala21 methyl REDOR data are consistent with either 17 + k ↔ 20 k or 17 + k ↔ 21 - k registries of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Together with the results in Figure 6 discussed above, our REDOR data for D23N-A β 40 fibrils indicate that fibrils with antiparallel β -sheet structures have the 17 + k ↔ 21 - k registry.

REDOR simulations in Figure 7C assume that each Ala21 methyl 13 C is dipole-coupled to Leu17 amide 15 N on both nearest-neighbor chains. 15 N- 13 C distances extracted from antiparallel β -sheet models are 5.1 and 6.3 Å for 17 + k ↔ 20 k registry, 5.3 and 5.6 Å for 17 + k ↔ 21 k registry, and 6.4 and 7.4 Å for 17 + k ↔ 22 k registry. The similar distances for 17 + k ↔ 20 k and 17 + k ↔ 21 k registries result in similar REDOR curves. Deviations of experimental REDOR data for peak b from simulated curves may be due to partial overlap with Ala21 methyl signals from parallel β -sheet structures, which would reduce the experimentally determined values of ΔS/S 0 .

Figure 8A shows the aliphatic region of a 2D 13 C- 13 C NMR spectrum of rehydrated D23N-A β 40 fibrils prepared with uniform 15 N and 13 C labeling of Phe19, Glu22, Val24, Gly25, Lys28, Ile31, and Leu34. This spectrum was obtained with a 2.232 ms mixing period of dipolar recoupling, using the fpRFDR technique ( 44 , 45 ), which produces strong cross-peaks between NMR lines of directly bonded 13 C sites. Chemical shift assignments based on one-bond cross-peaks are shown in Figure 8A . Broad cross-peaks (>4 ppm fwhm) are observed for Glu22, Val24, Gly25, and Ile31, suggesting conformational variations in the bend region that may be associated with the fibril polymorphism. Narrower cross-peaks are observed for Phe19 and Leu34.

Panels B and C of Figure 8 show a 2D 13 C- 13 C NMR spectrum of the same sample, obtained with a 500 ms RAD mixing period ( 46 , 47 ). Under these measurement conditions, strong cross-peaks develop among all NMR lines within a single labeled residue, and weaker cross-peaks develop among NMR lines of sequential labeled residues (e.g., Val24/Gly25 cross-peaks in Figure 8B ) or nonsequential labeled residues that are in spatial proximity and hence have significant 13 C- 13 C nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole couplings (approximately 6 Å or less distance among side chain carbon atoms). In particular, cross-peaks between Phe19 aromatic signals at 129 ppm and Leu34 aliphatic signals around 25 ppm are observed, indicating contacts between side chains of Phe19 and Leu34. Such contacts between side chains of odd-numbered residues in the first β -strand segment and side chains of even-numbered residues in the second β -strand segment have been observed previously in WT-A β 40 fibrils ( 7 , 19 ). It is unclear whether these side chain-side chain contacts are present in all or only some D23N-A β 40 fibril structures.

Previous solid-state NMR studies have shown that oppositely charged Asp23 and Lys28 side chains interact through a salt bridge in certain WT-A β 40 fibrils, especially fibrils with a striated ribbon morphology that develop under agitated growth conditions ( 6 , 18 , 19 ). The formation of this salt bridge may be an important and even rate-limiting step for WT-A β 40 fibril nucleation or growth, as shown by the fact that a peptide with a lactam bond between these residues undergoes fibril formation at ~10 3 -fold faster rate ( 20 ). Since D23N-A β 40 lacks the negative charge at the mutated position, but still has a negative charge at the adjacent residue, Glu22, we asked whether a Glu22-Lys28 salt bridge might be present in D23N-A β 40 fibrils.

Figure 9 compares fsREDOR data for D23N-A β 40 fibrils with fsREDOR data for striated ribbon WT-A β 40 fibrils. These fsREDOR measurements were performed on rehydrated fibril samples with uniform 15 N, 13 C labeling of multiple residues, including Lys28 and either Glu22 (for D23N-A β 40) or Asp23 (for WT-A β 40). For D23N-A β 40 fibrils, no Glu22 side chain carboxyl signal is detected in the fsREDOR difference spectrum, even at the longest 15 N- 13 C dephasing periods. For WT-A β 40 fibrils, a strong Asp23 side chain carboxyl signal is detected in the fsREDOR difference spectrum, in agreement with earlier measurements ( 19 ). Thus, we find no evidence that side chain carboxyl groups of Glu22 are in close proximity (5 Å or less) to side chain amine groups of Lys28 in D23N-A β 40 fibrils, i.e., no evidence for Glu22-Lys28 salt bridge interactions.

## DISCUSSION
In this paper, we described structural features of amyloid fibrils formed by an A β peptide bearing an Asp23 → Asn point mutation ( 22 ). The proband with this mutation was a member of a three-generation Iowa family with autosomal dominant dementia beginning in the sixth or seventh decade of life ( 23 ). The symptoms in the proband and an affected brother included progressive aphasic dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. At post-mortem examination, the brain showed severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), widespread neurofibrillary tangles, and unusually extensive distribution of A β 40 in plaques. The plaques also were less compact and had a higher A β 40/A β 42 ratio than the plaque occurring in wild-type Alzheimer’s disease.

The unusual phenotype of this form of fami/lial dementia, and the presence of a structural mutation within a region of the A β peptide that is critical in determining fibril structure, suggested to us that the fibrils and other aggregates might also have unusual features. We observed that D23N-A β 40 formed fibrils more rapidly than WT-A β 40, though not so rapidly as lactam(D23/K28)-A β 40: k = 3.77 × 10 -4 min -1 , compared to k = 1.07 × 10 -4 min -1 for WT-A β 40 and k = 0.107 min -1 for lactam(D23/K28)-A β 40. Moreover, D23N-A β 40 showed no lag period in the fibrillation kinetics, and thioflavin T fluorescence values were consistently somewhat higher than those of WT-A β 40, suggesting that D23N-A β 40 fibrils differed structurally from WT-A β 40 fibrils. The rapid fibrillation and lack of a lag period also suggest that structural differences in the fibrils may reflect structural differences in prefibrillar aggregates.

The possibility of structural differences from the wild-type peptide was confirmed in further studies by electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, and solid-state NMR. Electron microscopy showed abundant fibrils with multiple morphologies, the majority of which had a smaller mean diameter than typical wild-type A β 40 fibrils. Fiber diffraction of aligned D23N-A β 40 fibrils showed two reflections consistent with the expected cross- β structure, but at 4.7 and 9.4 Å. The latter number is significantly smaller than the corresponding number for WT-A β 40 fibrils grown under similar conditions (10.4 Å), suggesting that the β -sheets in D23N-A β 40 fibrils are more closely packed, on average, than in WT-A β 40 fibrils.

Solid-state NMR data for D23N-A β 40 fibrils are striking in several respects. First, although fibril polymorphism is expected to produce multiple sets of 13 C and 15 N chemical shifts, the chemical shift variations in Figure 5A,B and in Figure 4 are quite large, qualitatively suggesting large structural variations. The PITHIRDS-CT and fpRFDR-CT data in Figure 5 are unprecedented. Similar measurements on WT-A β 40 fibrils with various morphologies have always shown pronounced 13 C signal decays on the 30 ms time scale, indicating in-register, parallel β -sheets ( 3 , 6 , 7 ), especially for 13 C-labeled sites in residues 12-39. The significantly slower signal decays for approximately two-thirds of the 13 C signal from all of the labeled sites in Figure 5 are strong evidence for anomalous β -sheet structures in D23N-A β 40 fibrils. We emphasize that exhaustive TEM imaging of our D23N-A β 40 samples (as in Figure 1 ) shows no evidence for nonfibrillar D23N-A β 40 aggregates. Thus, we believe that all signals in Figure 5 and in other solid-state NMR experiments described above arise from fibrils.

REDOR data in Figures 6 and 7 support the existence of anomalous β -sheet structures, as these data indicate shorter distances between Phe20 amide sites and carbonyl sites of Leu17 and Val18 and between Leu17 amide sites and methyl sites of Ala21 than are expected in an in-register, parallel structure. The combined REDOR data support the existence of antiparallel β -sheets with 17 + k ↔ 21 - k hydrogen bond registry in the D23N-A β 40 fibrils that do not contain the more conventional in-register, parallel β -sheets. Antiparallel β -sheets have not been demonstrated previously in amyloid fibrils formed by peptides longer than 15 residues. 17 + k ↔ 21 - k registry has been established previously for the antiparallel β -sheets in fibrils formed by residues 16-22 of A β ( 13 , 14 ).

Additional experiments will be required before specific structural models for D23N-A β 40 fibrils can be developed and proven. Foremost among these experiments would the development of fibrillization techniques that yield less heterogeneous fibril samples. Nevertheless, several pieces of data are consistent with a strand-bend-strand model, in particular, ( 1 ) the non- β -sheet secondary chemical shift of Val24, which is also non- β -sheet in other amyloid fibrils where the strand-bend-strand has been demonstrated from other types of data ( 2 , 7 , 18 , 19 ), ( 2 ) the presence of a contact between the side chains of Leu17 and Phe34, and ( 3 ) the predominant modal fibril diameter of 7 nm, which is inconsistent with a fully extended β -sheet and could accommodate only ~20 residues. While these data allow only for tentative conclusions, Figure 10 shows a hypothetical model that may apply to fibrils with antiparallel β -sheet structures. Parallel β -sheets favor maximization of hydrophobic interactions in A β fibrils ( 5 , 13 ); in addition, Figure 10 shows how the strand-bend-strand conformational motif of A β may also allow favorable alignment of N-terminal (residues 17-21) and C-terminal (residues 30-40) hydrophobic segments in an antiparallel β -sheet structure by positioning the two hydrophobic segments in separate β -sheet layers. The antiparallel structure may also allow favorable electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged Lys16 and Glu22 side chains and possibly between Lys28 side chains and the C-terminal carboxylate of Val40. Why the D23N substitution facilitates formation of antiparallel β -sheet structures and whether wild-type A β can also adopt an antiparallel structure under certain circumstances are unresolved questions. Since amyloid fibril structures are kinetically determined at the nucleation stage rather than thermodynamically determined ( 6 ), preference for parallel or antiparallel structures in mature fibrils may be a consequence of the structural properties of mutant and wild-type peptide oligomers.

Finally, it is tempting to speculate about the possible relationship between the structure of D23N-A β 40 fibrils and the unusual phenotype of this form of familial AD. Although neuritic plaques are increased in patients with the Iowa mutation, the dominant disease phenotype results from cerebrovascular deposition of peptide. Cerebrovascular deposition of WT-A β 40 is also a feature associated with sporadic, late-onset AD, though this feature is usually less prominent than in patients with CAA, such as those patients with the Iowa mutation. CAA is also found in patients with other point mutations in the same coding region of β -amyloid, i.e., the Dutch (E22Q), Arctic (E22G), Italian (E22K), and Flemish (A21G) mutations, some of which also are associated with more typical lesions of AD such the neuritic plaque. In addition, CAA has been described in association with mutations in the genes for other proteins, including cystatin C and transthyretin, both of which readily form fibrils. CAA is also a frequent finding in individuals with sporadic, late-onset Alzhei-mer’s disease. It has been estimated that 30-40% of patients with CAA have AD by clinical or pathological criteria ( 51 ), and most patients with autopsy-proven AD also have some degree of histologically demonstrable CAA, often extensive ( 52 , 53 ). Both clinical entities are associated with the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε 4 allele ( 54 ). Nevertheless, there are also individuals with “pure” forms of either AD with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or CAA ( 54 , 55 ).

It is not well understood how A β peptides are partitioned between cerebrospinal fluid and blood vessels, and the receptors and transporters of these peptides are still largely uncharacterized. An intriguing possibility stems from the observation that both WT-A β 40 fibrils and D23N-A β 40 fibrils are polymorphic. It is possible that D23N-A β 40 preferentially adopts a conformation that favors transport of this peptide into the vascular wall. According to this speculative hypothesis, WT-A β 40 can also adopt this conformation and be transported to the vascular wall but does so less often than the mutant peptide.
