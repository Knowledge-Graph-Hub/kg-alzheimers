Single-Molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detects serum proteins at subfemtomolar concentrations

# Abstract
The detection of single protein molecules 1 , 2 in blood could help identify many new diagnostic protein markers. We report an approach for detecting hundreds to thousands of individual protein molecules simultaneously that enables the detection of very low concentrations of proteins. Proteins are captured on microscopic beads and labeled with an enzyme, such that each bead has either one or zero enzyme-labeled proteins. By isolating these beads in arrays of 50-femtoliter reaction chambers, single proteins can be detected by fluorescence imaging. By singulating molecules in these arrays, ~10–20 enzymes can be detected in 100 μL (~10 −19 M). Single molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (digital ELISA) based on singulation of enzyme labels enabled the detection of clinically-relevant proteins in serum at concentrations (<10 −15 M) much lower than conventional ELISA 3 - 5 . Digital ELISA detected prostate specific antigen in all tested sera from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy, down to 14 fg/mL (0.4 fM).

Beads functionalized with DNA capture probe (5’-NH 2 /C12-GTT GTC AAG ATG CTA CCG TTC AGA G-3’) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These beads were incubated with 1 μM of biotinylated complementary DNA (5’-biotin-C TCT GAA CGG TAG CAT CTT GAC AAC-3’) overnight (16 h) in TE buffer containing 0.5M NaCl and 0.01% Tween-20. After incubation, the beads were washed three times in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. The bead stock was distributed into a microtiter plate giving 400,000 beads per well in 100 μL. The buffer was aspirated from the microtiter plate wells, the beads were resuspended and incubated with various concentrations of SβG in Superblock containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 5 h. The beads were then separated and washed six times with 5× PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. For detection of enzyme, the beads were either: a) resuspended in 20 μL of PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, and 10 μL aliquots were loaded onto two femtoliter well arrays for SiMoA detection, or; b) resuspended in 100 μL of 100 μM RGP in PBS, incubated for 1 h at 23 °C, and read on a fluorescence plate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan).

Beads functionalized with an antibody to the target protein were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 100-μL test solutions containing the protein of interest were incubated with suspensions of 200,000 magnetic beads for 2 h at 23 °C. The beads were then separated and washed three times in PBS and 0.1% Tween-20. The beads were resuspended and incubated with solutions containing detection antibody (typically around 1 nM) for 45 min at 23 °C. The beads were then separated and washed three times in PBS and 0.1% Tween-20. The beads were incubated with solutions containing SβG (1–50 pM) for 30 min at 23 °C, separated, and washed six times in PBS and 0.1% Tween-20. The beads were then resuspended in 10 μL of PBS and loaded onto a femtoliter well array. The total time of the assay was ~6 h.

200,000 beads functionalized with DNA capture probe were incubated with 100-μL solutions containing the target DNA (5’-TT GAC GGC GAA GAC CTG GAT GTA TTG CTC C TCT GAA CGG TAG CAT CTT GAC AAC-3’) for 2 h. After incubation, the DNA target solution was removed and the beads were washed three times in 0.2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. The beads were then resuspended and mixed with 10 nM biotinylated signal probe (5’-TAC ATC CAG GTC TTC GCC GTC AA/Biotin/-3’) that is also specific to the target DNA for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times in 0.2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 after removing the signal probe. A solution of 10 pM SβG was then added to the bead pellet, resuspended, and mixed for 1 h. The beads were separated and washed six times in 5× PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. The beads were then resuspended in 10 μL of PBS and loaded onto a femtoliter well array.

Optical fiber bundles approximately 5-cm long were sequentially polished on a polishing machine using 30-, 9-, and 1-micron-sized diamond lapping films. The polished fiber bundles were chemically etched in a 0.025 M HCl solution for 130 seconds, and then immediately submerged into water to quench the reaction. The etched fibers were sonicated for 5 s in water, washed in water for 5 min, and dried under vacuum. The differential etch rate of the core and cladding glass of the fiber bundle arrays caused 4.5-μm diameter wells to formed in the core fibers 30 . Different etch times resulting in different well depths were initially investigated. If wells were too deep, then multiple beads were deposited in each well and sealing was disrupted; if wells were too shallow, then the beads were not retained in the wells and poor loading efficiencies were observed. Well depths of 3.25±0.5 μm were optimal for retaining single beads in wells while maintaining good seals.

A short length of PVC tubing was placed on the etched end of a fiber bundle to create a reservoir to hold the bead solution. 10 μL of the concentrated bead solution was pipetted into this reservoir. The fiber bundle was then centrifuged at 1300 g for 10 min to force the beads into the etched wells. The PVC tubing was removed after centrifugation. The fiber bundle was dipped in PBS solution to wash off excess bead solution and the surface was swabbed with deionized water. In addition to well depth (see above), bead concentration was an important parameter for maximizing bead loading efficiencies. Above concentrations of 200,000 beads per 10 μL loaded, typically 40–60% of wells in a 50,000-well array were occupied by a single bead, resulting in % active beads with acceptable Poisson noise. At concentrations below 200,000 beads per 10 μL loaded, bead loading efficiency dropped, resulting in fewer active beads and higher Poisson noise. In these experiments, therefore, at least 200,000 beads per reaction were used and loaded onto the arrays.

A custom-built imaging system containing a mercury light source, filter cubes, objectives, and a CCD camera was used for acquiring fluorescence images. 21 , 23 Fiber bundles were mounted on the microscope stage using a custom fixture. A droplet of β-galactosidase substrate (RGP) was placed on the silicone gasket material, and placed in contact with the well arrays. A precision mechanical platform moved the silicone sheet into contact with the end of the fiber bundle, creating an array of isolated femtoliter reaction vessels. Fluorescence images were acquired (558 nm excitation; 577 nm emission) with an exposure time of 1011 ms. Five frames (at 30 s intervals) were taken for each femtoliter well array. The product of the enzymatic reaction used in these studies—resorufin—has high photostability with a low photobleaching rate (rate of photobleaching, k ph = 0.0013 s −1 ) 21 , making multiple exposures possible. We performed time-course fluorescence measurements to allow: a) stable fluorescent artifacts to be removed from images; and, b) to ensure that the signal from a beaded well was from an enzyme. For a), the first fluorescent image was subtracted from fluorescent images acquired at each subsequent time point. This process removed light intensity that did not change with time, e.g., fluorescence from dust and scattered light. For b), a positive or “on” well was identified only where fluorescence intensity in a beaded well increased in every frame, and by at least 20% over four frames. This process removed false positives from random changes in fluorescence during image acquisition. Supplemental Figure 1 shows histograms of fluorescence from wells with and without enzymes, showing the good distinction between “on” and “off” wells. Arrays were also imaged with white light to identify those wells that contain beads. After acquiring the fluorescence images, the arrays were illuminated with white light and imaged on the CCD camera. Due to scattering of light by the beads, those wells that contained a bead appeared brighter in the image than wells without beads. The fluorescence and white light images were analyzed using customized software.
