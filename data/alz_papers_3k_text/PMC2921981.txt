# Title
The disintegrin/metalloproteinase ADAM10 is essential for the establishment of the brain cortex

# Abstract
The metalloproteinase and major amyloid precursor protein (APP) α-secretase candidate ADAM10 is responsible for the shedding of proteins important for brain development, such as Cadherins, Ephrins and Notch receptors. Adam10 -/- mice die at embryonic day 9.5, due to major defects in development of somites and vasculogenesis. To investigate the function of ADAM10 in brain, we generated Adam10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice using a Nestin-Cre promotor, limiting ADAM10 inactivation to neural progenitor cells (NPC) and NPC-derived neurons and glial cells. The cKO mice die perinatally with a disrupted neocortex and a severely reduced ganglionic eminence, due to precocious neuronal differentiation resulting in an early depletion of progenitor cells. Premature neuronal differentiation is associated with aberrant neuronal migration and a disorganized laminar architecture in the neocortex. Neurospheres derived from Adam10 -cKO mice have a disrupted sphere organisation and segregated more neurons at the expense of astrocytes. We found that notch-1 processing was affected leading to down regulation of several notch regulated genes in Adam10 -cKO brains, in accordance with the central role of ADAM10 in this signalling pathway and explaining the neurogenic phenotype. Finally, we found that α-secretase-mediated processing of APP was largely reduced in these neurons, demonstrating that ADAM10 represents the most important APP α-secretase in brain. Our study reveals that ADAM10 plays a central role in the developing brain by controlling mainly notch-dependent pathways but likely also by reducing surface shedding of other neuronal membrane proteins including APP.

## Introduction
ADAM10 is a member of the large family of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases (ADAMs) and is expressed in oligodendrocytes and a subset of developing neurons and brain nuclei and in differentiating gray matter ( Lin et al., 2008 ). It is thought to be responsible for the shedding of several cell-surface proteins in the brain, such as Ephrins ( Hattori et al., 2000 ; Janes et al., 2005 ), Amyloid precursor protein ( Hooper and Turner, 2002 ; Asai et al., 2003 ; Postina et al., 2004 ), Prion protein ( Vincent, 2004 ), and axon guidance molecules such as Neuronal adhesion molecule ( Hinkle et al., 2006 ), L1 adhesion molecule ( Gutwein et al., 2003 ) and N-cadherin ( Reiss et al., 2005 ). It also controls the proteolytic processing of the Notch receptor ( Pan and Rubin, 1997 ; Wen et al., 1997 ; Hartmann et al., 2002 ; Lieber et al., 2002 ), which mediates lateral inhibition during neurogenesis. Adam10 knockout mice die at embryogenic day 9.5 due to major developmental defects, including disturbed somitogenesis, a shortened forebrain primordium and severe vascular defects ( Hartmann et al., 2002 ). This early lethality has precluded further investigation of ADAM10 function in the brain in vivo .

The signals transduced by the Notch receptors are crucial in cell-fate decisions, both during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis ( Gordon et al., 2008 ). Signalling of the Notch receptor is dependent on three types of proteolytic events ( Mumm and Kopan, 2000 ). After the first cleavage the heterodimeric receptor is able to interact with Notch-ligands allowing a second (S2) cleavage within the Notch extracellular-juxtamembrane region by ADAM proteases. The S2 cleavage is necessary for subsequent γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis within the transmembrane region. This allows the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) to translocate into the nucleus, thereby directly activating gene expression. Both ADAM10 and ADAM17 have been implicated in this S2 cleavage. Recent in vitro studies suggest that ADAM10 is absolutely required for ligand induced Notch-1 signalling ( van Tetering et al., 2009 ), while ligand-independent Notch-1 signalling requires ADAM17 ( Cagavi Bozkulak and Weinmaster, 2009 ).

APP ectodomain shedding is followed by further cleavage of the transmembrane fragment by the γ-secretase complex releasing an APP intracellular domain (AICD). The nature of the metalloprotease responsible for the physiologic processing of APP is not completely clear. Overexpression studies and in vitro cleavage assays indicate that ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 are able to act as α-secretases ( Buxbaum et al., 1998 ; Postina, 2008 ). Overexpression of ADAM10 in an Alzheimer’s mouse model resulted in a decrease in β-amyloid deposition and cognitive deficits, ( Postina et al., 2004 ) but since transgenic overexpression of proteins creates a highly unphysiological situation, formal proof that ADAM10 is the crucial neuronal α-secretase needs an additional loss of function approach.

We decided to specifically disrupt the protease in neurons using newly generated Adam10 floxed mice crossed with Nestin-Cre transgenic mice. The neural progenitor-specific disruption of ADAM10 led to late embryonic lethality, a reduction of the ganglionic eminence and disrupted organisation of the cortical region. We analyzed the phenotype further using primary neurospheres and primary cell cultures to investigate Notch signalling and APP processing.

## Material and Methods
A mouse cosmid clone containing the 5’ region of the Adam10 gene with exon 2 was isolated from a 129/ola cosmid library (RZPD clone ID F11344Q2). For construction of the targeting vector, a 8.2-kb KpnI-PstI DNA restriction fragment of Adam10 covering exon 2, 7.3 kb 5’ sequence, and 5.8 kb 3’ downstream sequence was subcloned into the plasmid vector pUC-18. The hygromycin B resistance gene, driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter flanked with two FRT sequences, one loxP sequence downstream of the hygromycin B resistance gene, was inserted in the NotI-ApaI site 5’ upstream of exon2 in intron1. A second loxP sequence was inserted into the SphI-SpeI site in intron 2. The targeting vector was linearized with KpnI and introduced into the ES cell line E14 129 SvEv by electroporation (ITL ingenious targeting laboratory, inc, NY). Hygromycin B-resistant (100μg/ml) colonies were screened by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA of ADAM10 ES cells was digested with Pst1, BanI and hybridized either with a 5’ external gDNA probe ( KpnI-BglII 767 bp fragment), internal hygromycin probe and a 3’ external gDNA probe (5’ TCT TGG CAG AGC TTG AGC A 3’- 5’ ACA CAG GGG CTG GAA TAC TTC TA 3’) as indicated in Fig. 1A and displayed in Fig. 1B . Mutated ES cell lines were microinjected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J mice. Chimeric males were obtained and mated with C57BL/6J females to transmit the modified Adam10 alleles to the germ line. Animals carrying a null allele were obtained after breeding with transgenic females expressing a Nestin driven Cre-recombinase. Determinations of the genotypes of the floxed mice or yolk sac of embryos were done by PCR analysis using the primers as indicated in Fig. 1A and displayed in 1C. To generate Adam10 cKO mice, homozygous floxed mice ( Adam10 Fl/Fl ) were crossed with Nestin-Cre transgenic mice ( Tronche et al., 1999 ) to obtain mice heterozygous for the floxed Adam10 allele and hemizygous for the Nestin-Cre allele, which were then crossed with Adam10 Fl/Fl mice to obtain Adam10 cKO mice. Adam10 Fl/Fl , Adam10 Fl/+ or Nestin-Cre; Adam10 Fl/+ were used as a control.

Whole brains were taken from E12.5 embryos or P1 mice and were lysed using cell lysis buffer (5 mM Tris base, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM Sucrose, 1% Triton-X-100). Postnuclear fractions were taken, proteins were quantified using standard BCA assay (Pierce), 30μg protein/lane was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Roth) to perform western blot analysis. ADAM10 was detected using a polyclonal antiserum (B42.1) generated against the 17 C-terminal amino acid residues of ADAM10. Notch-1 fragments were detected with anti-Notch-1 mN1A antibody (SIGMA) raised against the cdc10-NCR region of Notch 1 and anti-activated Notch-1 8925 (Abcam) against the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). N-cadherin was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories (#610920) directed against the C-terminus of N-cadherin. Blots were developed using the ECL Detection System (Amersham).

Embryos were fixed by immersion in 4% buffered formalin. After overnight postfixation, embryos were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations and embedded in low melting point paraffin following standard laboratory procedures. From all paraffin blocks, 4-μm-sections were stained with hematoxilin and eosin (HE) following standard laboratory procedures and were submitted to immunostaining following standard immunohistochemistry procedures using the Ventana Benchmark XT machine (Ventana, Tucson, Arizona). Briefly, deparaffinated sections were boiled for 30-60 minutes in 10mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. All solutions provided by Ventana. Sections were then incubated with primary antibody in 5% goat serum (Dianova), 45% Tris buffered saline pH 7.6 (TBS), 0,1% Triton X-100 in antibody diluent solution (Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) for 1h. Followed by detection with anti-rabbit or anti-goat histofine Simple Stain MAX PO Universal immuno-peroxidase polymer, or Mouse Stain Kit (for detection of mouse antibodies on mouse sections). All secondary antibody-polymers were purchased from Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan. Detection of Antibodies was performed with “Ultra View Universal DAB Detection Kit” from Ventana according to standard settings of the machine. The counterstaining was also performed by the machine. Vasculature and connective tissue served as internal negative controls, additional negative controls included sections treated with secondary antibody only. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:50; Millipore), polyclonal anti-KI67 (1:100; Abcam) and polyclonal activated caspase-3 (1:1000; R&D Biosystems)

Pregnant females were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU (20mg/ml) at 100 mg/kg body mass at gestational stage E13.5 and labeled embryos were removed at day E17.5, processed and serially sectioned. Serial sections (6 μm) were used for immunohistological screening using monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:100; Roche). For this, the brain sections were deparaffinized in Clear-Rite (Prosan), rehydrated, and incubated in 2 N HCl for 20 min at 37°C, neutralized in 0.1M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed twice in PBS sequentially quenched for endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and blocked 30 min in a solution of TNB plus 5% of normal goat serum (DAKO) and incubated ON at 4°C with 0.1 mg/ml unconjugated fab fragment goat-anti-mouse IgG(Jackson Immuno Research) in TNB. Next day the primary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution, and after washing, was labeled with biotin conjugated affinipure fab fragment goat anti- mouse IgG (1:250 ; Jackson Immuno Research) for 20 min and detected by streptavidin –HRP (1:200 ; Perkin Elmer) for 20 min and a tyramide-based signal amplification technique (TSA, NEN-Dupont).

Neurospheres were generated as described ( Reynolds et al., 1992 ; Tropepe et al., 1999 ) with slight modifications. Lateral and medial ganglionic eminences were removed from embryos, mechanically dissociated using a pipette and resulting neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) were grown in a defined medium composed of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium and F-12 supplemented with glucose (0.6%) (Merck), sodium bicarbonate (3 mM) (Invitrogen), B27 (2%; Invitrogen), glutamine (2 mM) (Invitrogen), HEPES buffer (5 mM) (Invitrogen). The medium was supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml; TEBU, Offenbach, Germany) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2; 20 ng/ml; TEBU, Offenbach, Germany). The cells grew in neurospheres which were passaged by mechanical dissociation after pretreatment with accutase (PAA, Pasching, Austria) for 15 minutes approximately every 5 th day and reseeded with a density of 100,000 cell/ml. The number of vital cells was determined by 0.5% Trypan blue (Invitrogen) exclusion staining. From the first passage onward, neurospheres were passaged every fifth day and stem cell self-renewal was assessed.

For immunohistochemistry of proliferating neurospheres, neurospheres cultured for 5 days in vitro were transferred and washed in PBS. Neurospheres were then fixed in 4% buffered formalin overnight. The following day, neurospheres were pelleted and put in a drop 2% low melting agarose in PBS in a 1:1 ratio and further processed as above for paraffin embedding and immunostaining with the proper antibodies: KI67 (1:100; Abcam), Nestin (1:50; Millipore), GFAP (1:1000; Dako), Activated Caspase3 (1:1000; R&D biosystems), doublecortin (1:400; Millipore). H&E and Bielschowsky staining was performed according to standard procedures.

For differentiation experiments, neurospheres as a whole or dissociated into single cells with accutase (PAA) were plated at a density 500,000 cells/ml onto 15 mm glass coverslips coated with poly-L-ornithin (100 μg/ml PBS pH7.3) (Sigma) in serum-free culture medium without growth factors plus 1% of FBS. 5 days after plating, coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature followed a wash in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized for 5 min in PBS (pH 7.3) containing 0.1% Triton-X100, rinsed in PBS and blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% donkey serum (Sigma). After blocking, coverslips were incubated with anti-MAP-2c mouse monoclonal (1:400;Sigma) and anti-GFAP rabbit polyclonal (1:600; DAKO) antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% Serum for 1 h. Coverslips were then rinsed in PBS (pH7.3) containing 0.1% Triton-X100 and subsequently incubated in the appropriate alexa (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies for 1 h. Coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS. Separate coverslips (from similar culture conditions) were used for oligodendrocyte staining. Coverslips were incubated in anti-CNPase mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma) in PBS containing 5% of donkey serum 1 h. Then, the coverslips were rinsed and subsequently incubated in secondary alexa (Invitrogen) antibody. Cultures were counterstained with Dapi (10 μg/ml in H 2 0; Roche).

RNA was extracted out of whole brains taken from P1 control (n = 5) and Adam10 cKO (n = 3) animals using the NucleoSpin RNAII Kit (Macherey Nagel, Germany). 2 μg RNA were reversely transcribed using the RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Germany). Expression levels of Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, and Hey2 were determined by real-time PCR analysis of 0.5 μl cDNA on a 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays-on-Demand system and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (all Applied Biosystems, USA; assay numbers Mm00468601_m1, Mm00439311_g1, Mm00468865_m1, and Mm00469280_m1, respectively) in 10 μl reaction volume. The expression levels were normalized against Gapdh using the ΔΔCt method, and mean expression of the WT animals was set to 100%.

Primary neuronal cultures were generated from trypsinized brain obtained from 14-day-old embryos. Neurones were resuspended and plated on cell culture dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL, USA) pre-coated with 1 mg/mL of poly-lysine (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), and incubated in neurobasal medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) as described previously ( Annaert et al., 1999 ). Proliferation of non-neuronal cells was prevented by adding 5 μM cytosine arabinoside. 3-5 days old mouse primary neuronal cultures in neurobasal medium were incubated with 10-fold diluted SFV expressing the pSFV-1 plasmid bearing APP-WT. Cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37°C to allow entry of the virus, followed by incubation in conditioned medium in the absence of virus (for 2 h). Medium was collected for 5h. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton, and postnuclear fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Proteins were quantified by using a standard Bradford assay (Pierce) and 30 μg proteins per lane was loaded on Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot detection for the indicated proteins. Polyclonal antibody B63 was used to detect APP-FL and CTFs ( De Strooper et al., 1998 ; Annaert et al., 1999 ) in the cell extracts and 6E10 (Covance) and neo-epitope sAPPbeta antibody (Covance) for sAPPα, Aβ and sAPPβ, respectively, in the media. Levels of α- and β-cleaved carboxy-terminal stubs and secreted sAPP and total Aβ were normalized to the level of expression of APP holoprotein from the cell extracts.

Aβ40 and 42 were measured via ELISA1-40 and ELISA1-42. 96 well plates were coated with monoclonal antibodies either JRF/cAβ40/28 or JRF/cAβ42/26 ( Mathews et al., 2002 ) at 1.5μg/ml in coating buffer (10mM Tris, 10mM NaCl, and 10mM NaN3, pH 8.5) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, plates were blocked in 0.1% casein in PBS for 4h at RT to reduce non-specific binding. Standards and conditioned medium (undiluted for Aβ42 and 1/5 diluted for Aβ42) together with the detection antibody huAβ25-HRPO ( Vandermeeren et al., 2001 ) were loaded into triplicate wells for ELISA and incubated overnight at 4°C. ELISA plates were developed with TMB/H2O2 substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The reaction was stopped with 2N H2SO4 and the plates were read on Envision Alphascreen (PerkinElmer) at 450 nM. The different Aβ spieces were analyzed by urea-based Aβ SDS-PAGE and immune blot ( Wiltfang et al., 2002 ) using 82E1 (Demeditec Diagnostics), a monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminus of Aβ. Signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence. The individual Aβ species were normalized to the level of expression of APP holoprotein from the cell extracts.

Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s T-test using microsoft Excel software. Error bars indicate the mean +/- standard deviation of the mean. P values: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

## Results
To circumvent the early embryonic lethality of Adam10 -/- mice, we employed the Cre/loxP recombination system to restrict ADAM10 inactivation to the central nervous system (CNS) ( Fig. 1A ). The Adam10 gene was targeted conditionally with loxP sequences flanking exon 2 ( Adam10 Fl ). Successful targeting was confirmed by Southern blot ( Fig. 1B ). Homozygous floxed Adam10 Fl/Fl mice and the Adam10 Fl/+ hemizygous mice were viable and fertile and genotypes of tail-clips were determined by PCR ( Fig. 1C ). We then crossed Adam10 Fl mice with Nestin-Cre transgenic mice, in which Cre is expressed in neural precursor cells under the control of the Nestin promoter ( Tronche et al., 1999 ), to generate a neural progenitor cell-specific Adam10 conditional knockout ( Adam10 cKO) mouse. Expression of Cre transcripts in Nestin-cre transgenic mice begins at E9.0 in the spinal cord and the forebrain-midbrain junction, and then extends to the entire CNS by E10.5 ( Yang et al., 2004 ). The expression of Cre in the neural progenitor cells localized in the ventricular zone was demonstrated previously ( Graus-Porta et al., 2001 ). Western blotting established strongly decreased levels of ADAM10 protein in total brain extracts of Adam10 cKO mice ( Fig. 1D ), with a very low residual expression level likely caused by non-neuronal cells.

We intercrossed Nestin-Cre; Adam10 Fl/+ with Adam10 Fl/Fl animals. We analyzed 72 pups from birth until the time of weaning ( Table I ). Only 6 (8.3%) homozygous Adam10 floxed null mutants were observed that survived more than 12 h, indicating late embryonic and perinatal lethality of the mice. Macroscopically these cKO embryos did not display gross abnormalities except for intracranial hemorraghes ( Fig. 2A ).

We examined serial coronal brain sections of the Adam10 cKO and littermate control brains at different developmental stages between E12.5 and E17.5 by hematoxylin-eosin co-staining ( Fig. 2B ). The cerebral cortex was disorganized from E15.5 onward ( Fig. 2B i,j,o,p ) with the exception of the upper cortical layer. The boundary between the intermediate zone (IZ), a region where cells have undergone final mitosis and initiate migration, and the ventricular zone (VZ), where proliferating neuro-epithelial cells reside, had disappeared. The ganglionic eminence (GE) in the cKO mutants also appeared to be smaller at E12.5-E15.5 ( Fig. 2B e,f,k,l ), a phenotype which became more apparent by E17.5 ( Fig. 2B q,r ). Furthermore, the cortical region and GE displayed severe cell loss (a diminished cell number) at E17.5 ( Fig. 2B p, r ). These findings suggest that loss of ADAM10 disrupts the cortical organization and impairs the normal development of the GE.

The development of neurons in the embryonic brain is a complex cellular and molecular mechanism. It starts at approximately E11 with the birth of new neurons from stem cell precursors, a process called neurogenesis, and continues through E17 compromising 11 cell cycles ( Caviness et al., 1995 ; McConnell, 1995 ). During early neurogenesis, very few progenitor cells in the neuroepithelium exit the cell cycle to become postmitotic neurons, while the vast majority of progenitor cells re-enter the cell cycle after mitosis, resulting in an expansion of the neural progenitor population in the ventricular zone. As neurogenesis progresses, a fraction of neural progenitor cells complete their final mitosis, differentiate into postmitotic neurons and migrate from the ventricular zone into the cortical plate, forming an “inside-out” gradient of maturation. This process is guided by radial glial fibers ( Angevine and Sidman, 1961 ; Rakic, 1988 ; Hatten, 1990 ; Mission et al., 1991 ; Hatten, 1993 ). A massive neuronal loss in the brain and a disturbance of the lamellar composition of the neocortex can occur via several possible mechanisms such as: (1) premature differentiation of progenitor cells, (2) decreased proliferation, (3) increased apoptotic cell death or (4) cortical migration defects.

To assess neuronal differentiation in the Adam10 cKO and control brains, we performed immunostaining for NeuN, a marker for postmitotic neurons, at E12.5, E15.5 and E17.5 ( Fig. 3A ). At E12.5 there was no difference in the pattern of the NeuN immune-reactive neurons of the Adam10 cKO mice compared to controls ( Fig. 3A a-f ). At E15.5 more postmitotic neurons labeled by NeuN were found in the GE and the neocortex of the Adam10 cKO ( Fig. 3A g-l ). The ventricular zone, which consists of NeuN negative progenitor cells in the control, contained also postmitotic neurons in the Adam10 cKO ( Fig. 3A i,j ). However, at E17.5 the number of NeuN positive cells of the cortex and the GE had decreased in Adam10 cKO ( Fig. 3A m-r ). Taken together, these observations point towards a premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells into postmitotic neurons in the absence of ADAM10 resulting in an early depletion of the neural progenitor population.

Bromodesoxyuridine (BrdU) birth dating was used to examine whether the abnormalities in cortical layering reflected abnormal neuronal migration. Neurons were labeled at E13.5, and appeared more brightly stained at E17.5 in the Adam10 cKO that in the control brains ( Fig. 3B b ). This indicated that neurons had exited the cell cycle more early following the pulse in the cKO brains than in the wild type brains, thereby retaining all of the incorporated BrdU. ( Fig. 3B b to be compared with 3B a ). This observation was in agreement with the NeuN immunostaining in Fig. 3A . The labelled cells in the control brain were localized mostly in the cortical plate, whereas in the cKO more cells were scattered across the intermediate zone ( Fig. 3B a,b ). These results indicated a role for ADAM10 in cortical layering and neuronal migration.

The early neuronal differentiation could explain the cell loss observed in the Adam10 cKO brains, but alternatively changes in proliferation or apoptosis had to be considered as well. We first immunolabeled sections from control and Adam10 cKO embryos with the cell cycle marker KI67 ( Fig. 4 ). No difference in the number of KI67 positive proliferating cells in the Adam10 cKO and littermate control brains at E12.5 ( Fig. 4 a-f ) was observed, showing that the lack of ADAM10 does not lead to a reduction in the proliferation rate of neural progenitor cells at early embryonic age. However, at E15.5 the Adam10 cKO cortex displayed a minor and the GE a drastic decrease in the number of KI67 positive cells ( Fig. 4 g-l ), which corresponded to the increased number of NeuN positive cells in Fig 3A at the same embryonic age. By E17.5, considerably fewer KI67 positive cells remained in the ventricular zone of the cKO brains ( Fig. 4 m-r ). We also performed staining for activated Caspase-3 on serial coronal brain sections at E12.5, E15.5 and E17.5 in Adam10 cKO and control brains (data not shown). A minor number of positive cells were observed in cKO and the control brains and although close observation suggested a slight increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the cortex and GE from cKO brains, this difference was not significant (Table SI), indicating that apoptosis is not the primary cause of cell loss in the E17.5 Adam10 cKO brains.

We examined the number of neural stem cells in the Adam10 cKO embryonic brain using the neurosphere assay ( Reynolds et al., 1992 ; Tropepe et al., 1999 ). The ganglionic eminence from E13.5 Adam10 cKO embryos and their littermate controls were dissociated into single cells to generate neurospheres ( Fig 5A ). The number of neural stem cells isolated from the E13.5 Adam10 cKO brains was decreased by 50 % ( Fig. 5B ; p<0.01). In addition an increased number of differentiated cells were attached to the flask compared to littermate controls ( Fig. 5A ). Single primary neurosphere colonies were capable of producing new secondary neuropheres after 5 days in vitro . The number of descendant secondary neurospheres generated from subcloning the single primary neurosphere can be used to estimate the extent to which the initial primary neurosphere from stem cells undergoes symmetric expansionary divisions ( Reynolds and Weiss, 1996 ). The numbers of secondary neurosphere colonies from E13.5 Adam10 cKO and control were the same (data not shown). There was also no difference in the amount of KI67 proliferating cells or apoptotic cells within the neurospheres ( Fig. 5C c-f, m,n and 5D ), suggesting that the remaining proliferating cells in the Adam10 cKO brains retained a normal proliferation capacity.

Each sphere represents a mixture of stem and early committed precursor cells ( Campos et al., 2004 ). To examine the cellular composition and distribution inside the neurospheres, we cut paraffin sections of intact proliferating neurospheres and immunostained them with different antibodies ( Fig. 5 C ). We then compared the distribution of stem cell markers (KI67, nestin Fig. 5C c,e ) with markers of early committed precursor cells for neurons (doublecortin, Fig. 5C i ) and astrocytes (GFAP, Fig. 5C g ). KI67+ and Nestin+ cells were present around the edge of the sphere, whereas the differentiation markers were mainly present inside the sphere, demonstrating the separation of stem cell and early committed precursor populations in the neurospheres. This might reflect the situation in the developing nervous system where the proliferating stem cells in the ventricular zone form a distinct layer from the newly differentiated post-mitotic neurones present in more superficial regions of the cortex. This was further illustrated by a separation of KI67 and NeuN expression in the control embryonic cortex as shown in Fig. 3 and 4 . The Adam10 cKO spheres displayed a disturbed organisation, similar to the situation in vivo , suggesting that the neurosphere model is indeed a good model to investigate the function of ADAM10 in neuronal differentiation ( Fig. 5 a-n ). Taken together, there were less neural stem cells in the Adam10 cKO brains, but the remaining proliferating cells were perfectly capable of proliferating and generating neurospheres in vitro , demonstrating their neuronal stem cell capacity.

To assess neural stem-cell multipotentiality, secondary neurospheres as a whole or in single cell suspension were cultured on poly-ornithin-coated coverslips in the presence of 1% serum for 5 days. The cells were immunostained for MAP2 (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes) and CNPase (oligodendrocytes) ( Fig. 6A ). The neurospheres derived from E13.5 Adam10 cKO neural stem cells gave rise to more neuronal progeny than those from control neural stem cells as demonstrated by the strong increase in MAP2 expressing cells. However, the increase in neurons occurred at the expense of the glial lineages as seen by the decreased number of GFAP+ cells ( Fig. 6A a-d and schematized in 6C ). No difference was observed in the number of oligodendrocytes, but it should be noted that they represented only a minor fraction of the total cell number ( Fig. 6A e,f; 6B ). In addition, we saw a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the Adam10 cKO when compared to control spheres ( Fig. 6A g,h; 6B ).

Notch activity has been shown to be important in cell-fate decision during neurogenesis ( Ishibashi et al., 1995 ; Schuurmans and Guillemot, 2002 ; Yoon et al., 2004 ; Alexson et al., 2006 ). To understand the molecular base of the premature neuronal differentiation in Adam10 cKO embryos, we analyzed extracts from P1 brains from Adam10 cKO and controls for the presence of Notch1 fragments ( Fig. 6D ). Using an antibody against the mouse Notch-1 Cdc10/Ankyrin Repeat Cytokine Response Region an accumulation of the furin-generated S1 Notch-1 cleavage product in the absence of ADAM10 was evident ( Fig. 6D ). In line with these observations immunoblotting of Adam10 cKO brain extracts using an antibody directed against the cleaved intracellular (activated) form of the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) also revealed a strong reduction in the generation of NICD in comparison to Adam10 Fl/Fl brain extracts not expressing the Cre transgene ( Fig. 6D ).

To address the question whether the observed alteration in Notch-1 processing affects Notch1- dependent signalling we also investigated Hes1, Hes5, Hey1 and Hey2 transcripts which encode basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, major downstream effectors of the notch signalling pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR of whole brain extracts from newborns demonstrated a significant reduction of 47%, 90%, 40% and 49%, respectively ( Fig. 6E ), indicating a down regulation of Notch signalling in the absence of ADAM10.

The generation of ADAM10 deficient neurons provided a unique opportunity to address the importance of ADAM10 in the physiologic constitutive processing of APP. To address this question, we analyzed the generation of APP cleavage products in primary neuronal cultures from E14.5 Adam10 cKO embryos compared to controls. The APP ectodomain (sAPPα, sAPPβ), full length (APP-FL), membrane-bound CTF (APP-CTFα, APP-CTFβ) and total Aβ were analyzed from supernatants and cell extract of dissociated neurons ( Fig. 7 ). Taken together, the diminished appearance of the membrane-bound α-secretase–cleaved APP CTF (CTFα), and the observed 90 % reduction in the levels of secreted sAPPα indicate that ADAM10 is the most important APP α-secretase in these neurons. Surprisingly we also observed a paradoxical reduction in CTFβ, sAPPβ and total Aβ peptide production and in the amount of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the Adam10 cKO ( Fig. 7 A, B ). Comparison of the Aβ spectra between control and Adam10 cKO showed no shift towards longer Aβ peptide species (Aβ1–42) or shorter Aβ peptides (Aβ1–37, Aβ1–38, Aβ1–40), but confirmed the general decrease in all the Aβ species in the cKO ( Fig. 7 C, D ).

## Discussion
In the current manuscript, we demonstrate the crucial role of ADAM10 in neuronal differentiation and the establishment of the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we provide evidence for its essential role in Notch signalling and in the physiological α-secretase processing of APP in neurons.

Using a CNS-specific Nestin-Cre mouse, which expresses Cre-recombinase in the NPC ( Zimmerman et al., 1994 ) we were able to circumvent the previously documented early embryonic lethality of Adam10 KO mice ( Fig. 1 and Table I ). Nevertheless CNS organization was severely affected in these embryos leading to massive intracranial bleedings and complete disorganisation of the cortical layering of the brain ( Fig. 2 ). Detailed histological analyses of the Adam10 cKO brain showed an increased number of postmitotic neurons revealed by NeuN staining ( Fig. 3A ) and a reduced number of KI67 positive progenitor cells ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, lack of ADAM10 causes a premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells into postmitotic neurons, resulting in a partial depletion of the neural progenitor population, which also explains the small GE. These studies were further confirmed with the neurosphere assay, which indicates that more mature neurons are already obtained when plating cells from ADAM10-deficient brains ( Fig. 5 ). The relative depletion of neurons was not associated with increased activated Caspase-3 staining, showing that loss of ADAM10 does not result in massive apoptotic cell death at early stages (Table SI), ruling out the possibility of apoptosis as the primary cause of neuronal cell loss.

The effect of ADAM10, as would be predicted for a premature differentiation phenotype, is not observed in the neuronal progenitor cells per se. Although less progenitors are present in the plating assay ( Fig. 5 ), they remain fully capable of generating neurons and glia cells ( Fig. 6 ). This was also further confirmed in vivo as KI67 positive, proliferating cells were equally present in Adam10 cKO and control brains at an early developmental age E12.5 ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, ADAM10 is not involved in the regulation of the early neural progenitor proliferation. Our H&E stainings ( Fig. 2 ) revealed a disruption of the cortical layering and BrdU cell birth dating analyses showed an apparent defect in neuronal migration in the Adam10 cKo, with neurons arriving in ectopic sites ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests a role for ADAM10 in the regulation of the neuronal migration during cortical development.

The Notch signalling pathway is known to play a fundamental role in cell fate decisions in the development of the nervous system at many different levels. ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999 ). Notch signals govern the decision between neuronal (in an inhibitory fashion) and glial lineages (promoting this fate), modulate the fate of terminally differentiated neurons, affect neuronal migration and even learning and memory ( Yu et al., 2001 ; Costa et al., 2003 ; Saura et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2004 ; Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006 ; Corbin et al., 2008 ; Hashimoto-Torii et al., 2008 ). In addition, Notch pathway components, including ligands, receptors, modulators, and targets are expressed in the telencephalic ventricular zone ( Lindsell et al., 1996 ; Zhong et al., 1997 ; Irvin et al., 2001 ; Yun et al., 2002 ). Mouse mutants deficient in genes of the Notch signalling pathway, support the view that this pathway plays a critical role in regulating the neural progenitor pool during neocortical development ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999 ; Hitoshi et al., 2002 ; Yoon et al., 2004 ; Mizutani and Saito, 2005 ; Yoon and Gaiano, 2005 ; Gaiano, 2008 ). Conditional deletion of Notch1 in the neural progenitor pool, similar to the strategy used for the ADAM10 deletion reported here indeed resulted in precocious neuronal differentiation ( Yang et al., 2004 ). A similar phenotype was also found in Nestin-Cre transgene driven inactivation of Presenilin (PS) ( Kim and Shen, 2008 ) which is known to mediate the Notch-1 S3 cleavage and NICD production ( De Strooper et al., 1998 ; De Strooper et al., 1999 ). Both the Adam10 conditional knockout presented here and the PS inactivation in NPC and NPC-derived neurons and glia show that both Notch signalling proteases are required for neural progenitor cells to re-enter cell cycle and for the expansion of neural progenitor population during embryonic development. The depletion of progenitor cells may indeed also lead to a reduced number of astrocytes which are involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier thereby contributing to the haemorrhages observed in PS ( Kim and Shen, 2008 ) and Adam10 conditional knockout mice (this study).

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the premature neuronal differentiation observed in Adam10 cKO brain we examined the proteolytic processing of Notch-1 as well as the expression of Notch-1 target genes Hes1, 5 and Hey1, 2, which are basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulators that antagonize proneural genes like Mash1 and Neurogenins . This antagonism blocks early neuronal gene expression and is central to the inhibition of neuronal differentiation by Notch-1 signalling. By qRT-PCR we found a clear reduction in the mRNA expression of Hes1, 5 and Hey1,2 target genes, further proving the important role of ADAM10 in the regulation of the Notch signalling ( Fig. 6D ).

Whereas in Drosophila, the ADAM10 orthologue Kuzbanian has been amply demonstrated to act as Notch sheddase, in the mammalian system cell based assays have in contrast implicated mainly ADAM17 in the S2 Notch-1 cleavage ( Brou et al., 2000 ; Mumm et al., 2000 ). The Notch-like phenotype of classical Adam10 deficient mice ( Hartmann et al., 2002 ), the novel data in the current work showing a direct effect of ADAM10 on the ability to generate signal-relevant Notch Intracellular Domain, and the lack of Notch-related alterations in Adam17 deficient mice ( Peschon et al., 1998 ) clearly underline the essential role of ADAM10 as the Notch-sheddase in vivo also in mammalian species. Although the phenotype of our cKO mice clearly highlight the role of the ADAM10 in Notch-1 signalling we cannot completely exclude the possibility that part of the abnormalities may be explained by a reduced shedding of additional neuronal surface molecules. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in ADAM10 deficient neurons the CTF1 generation of N-cadherin was severely reduced (Fig. S1) confirming our earlier data ( Reiss et al., 2005 ) in fibroblast cells. We can also not rule out the possibility that the decreased level of sAPPα contributes to the alteration in neural progenitor cell proliferation/differentiation in our Adam10 cKO phenotype, as previous studies have shown that sAPPα is a neurothrophic factor that affects the development of embryonic brain cells including progenitor cells. sAPPα has also been suggested to play a role in developmental and synaptic plasticity in the nervous system ( Mattson, 1994 ; Furukawa et al., 1996 ; Caille et al., 2004 ; Rohe et al., 2008 ).

We finally focused on the processing of one, at least –from the medical point of view- most important putative ADAM10 substrate, i.e. APP. We provide here convincing evidence that loss of ADAM10 disturbs the α-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP to a large extent, indicating that ADAM10 is the major α-secretase in the cells that are most relevant to Alzheimer’s disease ( Fig. 7 ). Our work agrees with previous overexpression experiments in mice and in cell-based systems ( Postina et al., 2004 ; Postina, 2008 ). Although it is possible that the other α-secretase candidates, including ADAM9 and ADAM17 also contribute to a certain extent to APP processing in neurons, their contribution appears to be quantitative much less significant. Surprisingly we found in the ADAM10 KO neurons a paradoxical significant reduction in the β-secretase cleavage, which is in contradiction to the general dogma that BACE1 and α-secretase are in competition for ectodomain cleavage of APP ( Skovronsky et al., 2000 ). This concept is supported by a number of observations, for instance several pharmacological agents known to stimulate α-secretase cleavage of APP, also reduce β-cleavage, thereby reducing Aβ peptide generation ( Allinson et al., 2003 ). Likewise, overexpression of ADAM10 in an AD mouse model decreases Aβ plaque load and cognitive deficits ( Postina et al., 2004 ), while BACE1 reduction results in an elevation of α- and a decrease of β-cleavage ( Vassar et al., 1999 ). The molecular basis of this ‘competition’ between the two secretase pathways is not very well understood, and could involve as well direct competition between the two proteases for the substrate, as effects on subcellular trafficking of substrate or protease. In our experiments, in which ADAM10 is taken away in primary neurons, we see an opposite effect, i.e. a decrease in β-secretase activity (although β-secretase levels are not decreased, result not shown). We speculate that ADAM10 deficiency and the effects on APP processing result in a change in localization or subcellular trafficking of either BACE1 or APP but further research is clearly needed to explain this intriguing phenomenon.

In conclusion, we present the first characterization of neuron-specific Adam10 -deficient mice and provide substantial evidence for the key function of ADAM10 in neural Notch signalling, in Notch-dependent CNS development and in neuronal α-secretase processing of APP, with implications for Alzheimer’s Disease.
