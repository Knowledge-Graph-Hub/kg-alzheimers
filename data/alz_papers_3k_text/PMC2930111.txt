# Title
Common genetic variation in theHLAregion is associated with late-onset sporadic Parkinson’s disease

# Abstract
Parkinson disease (PD) is a common disorder that leads to motor and cognitive disability. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 2000 PD and 1986 control Caucasian subjects from NeuroGenetics Research Consortium. 1 – 5 We confirmed SNCA 2 , 6 – 8 and MAPT 3 , 7 – 9 ; replicated GAK 9 (P Pankratz+NGRC =3.2×10 −9 ); and detected a novel association with HLA (P NGRC =2.9×10 −8 ) which replicated in two datasets (P Meta-analysis =1.9×10 −10 ). We designate the new PD genes PARK17 (GAK) and PARK18 (HLA). PD- HLA association was uniform across genetic and environmental risk strata, and strong in sporadic (P=5.5×10 −10 ) and late-onset (P=2.4×10 −8 ) PD. The association peak was at rs3129882, a non-coding variant in HLA-DRA . Two studies suggested rs3129882 influences expression of HLA - DR and HLA-DQ . 10 , 11 PD brains exhibit up-regulation of DR antigens and presence of DR-positive reactive microglia. 12 Moreover, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) reduce PD risk. 4 , 13 The genetic association with HLA coalesces the evidence for involvement of the immune system and offers new targets for drug development and pharmacogenetics.

## Methods
Study was approved by Human Subject Committees at participating institutions. Patients and control subjects were recruited from eight NGRC-affiliated neurology clinics in Oregon, Washington, Georgia and New York. Methods were standardized across NGRC. Patients were diagnosed using the modified UK Brain Bank criteria. 23 Controls were community volunteers and patient spouses; 353 (ages 67–90; mean 86.3±4.1 years) were evaluated by neurologists in Oregon and were free of neurodegenerative disease, the remaining 1633 (ages 21–90, mean 67.0±12.0 years) self-reported as neurologically healthy. GWAS subjects met seven criteria: (1) Self-reported Caucasian, non-Hispanic, of European origin. (2) Patients with current diagnosis of PD, excluding those whose initial PD diagnosis changed during the ~12 years of follow up. (3) DNA extracted from whole blood, unamplified, concentration ≥ 50ng/μl. (4) Age at blood draw ≥21 years. (5) Known gender. (6) Known age at onset (one missing). (7) No blood-relation to other subjects. We had data on smoking, coffee, and NSAIDs on ~3,000 subjects and on country of ancestral origin for 2,080 subjects. 112 subjects reported as Ashkenazi Jewish (129 were Jewish according to PCA).

To reduce plate effects, DNA samples were randomized on genotyping plates by case-control status, recruitment site, control subjects who were healthy at age ≥85 years, DNA extraction method, and DNA storage time. Samples were genotyped at the Johns Hopkins Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data was released for 4,013 study samples (99.5% of attempted samples). Study samples, 90 duplicates, and 170 HapMap controls (151 CEU; 12 YRI, 3 JPT, 4 CHB) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the Illumina Infinium II assay protocol. Genotype cluster definitions for each SNP were determined using Illumina BeadStudio Genotyping Module version 3.3.7 and the combined intensity data from all released samples. Genotypes were not called if the quality threshold (Gencall score) was <0.15. Genotype data was released for 1,012,895 SNPs (99.65% of attempted). SNP assay failure criteria were: call rate <85%, cluster separation <0.2, >1 HapMap replicate error, >3% (autosomal) or >4% (X) difference in call rate between genders, >0.3% male AB frequency (X), or >8.8% (autosomal) or >13.2% (XY) difference in AB frequency. Y chromosome and mitochondrial SNPs were manually reviewed and clusters adjusted or genotypes dropped as appropriate. The mean non-Y SNP call rate and mean sample call rate were both 99.9% for the released dataset. Study duplicate reproducibility was ≥99.99% ( Supplementary Table 1 ).

Sex was determined by estimating X chromosome homozygosity and compared to self-reported gender; there was no discrepancy. We identified and excluded 1 patient and 3 controls who were inadvertently enrolled twice, and 13 cases and 10 controls for cryptic relatedness (PI-HAT>0.15). The final N for analysis was 2,000 patients and 1,986 controls. SNPs were excluded if MAF<0.01, call-rate<99%, HWE<10 −6 , MAF difference in males vs. females >0.15, or missing rate in PD vs. control P<10 −5 . 811,597 SNPs passed quality-control; with mean call rate of 99.92%. PCA was conducted with HelixTree ( www.goldenhelix.com ) using a pruned subset of 104,064 SNPs. Pruning was carried-out using PLINK with autosomal SNPs (MAF≥0.05, call rate ≥95%). We used a 50-SNP sliding-window that shifted 5 SNPs with each move and recursively removed SNPs with r 2 ≥0.2, followed by a second round using a 138 SNP sliding-window, resulting in 104,064 SNPs.

Association was tested under an additive model using logistic regression in PLINK V1.07. The analyses were adjusted for sex, age, PC1 and PC2. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was assessed using Haploview V4.1 35 and LocusZoom ( http://csg.sph.umich.edu/locuszoom/ ). For replication of NGRC results, we chose datasets that (a) were published by peer review, (b) had genotyped rs3129882, and (c) were Caucasian. Among four publically-available GWAS only “CIDR: Genome Wide Association Study in Familial Parkinson Disease (PD)” by Pankratz et al. 9 met our criteria. Two other GWAS have been published; 7 , 8 one was available to us and was used as second replication. 8 We applied the same sample and SNP quality-control filters to replication data sets as we did for NGRC, hence our results may vary slightly from their published results. Each replication dataset was individually tested using the tests and adjustments used by authors in their original report. Breslow-Day test-statistics was used to test heterogeneity across three datasets (P=0.6). We performed individual level Meta-analysis using Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test statistics accounting for study and gender. Chi-square test was used to test differences in MAF across disease, ethnic, and geographic strata.

To replicate previously reported GWAS findings, we used genotyped data when available and imputed SNPs that were not present on the array. We used PLINK for imputation, and included SNPs that had call rate ≥95% (information content metric value was >0.8). Meta-analysis was performed using CMH when individual level data was available, otherwise, we used aggregate (OR) data (PLINK was used). We used Breslow-Day test-statistics to test between-study heterogeneity for individual-level data and Q-test for aggregate-level data.

We used logistic regression to test combined effects of four loci (SNCA, MAPT, GAK, HLA). Subjects were classified by the total number of risk alleles (n) that they possessed (minimum=0, maximum=8); carriers of 0 or 1 risk allele were combined due to small numbers and set as the reference for comparison; carriers of 6 or more alleles were also combined due to small numbers at the extremes. Tests were performed comparing subjects with ‘n’ risk alleles to the reference group.
