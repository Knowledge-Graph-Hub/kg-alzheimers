# Title
Gamma-secretase activating protein, a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease

# Abstract
Accumulation of neurotoxic βamyloid (Aβ) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1 . Formation of Aβ is catalyzed by γsecretase, a protease with numerous substrates 2 , 3 . Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that confer substrate specificity on this potentially promiscuous enzyme. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its selectivity is critical for the development of clinically effective γ-secretase inhibitors that can reduce Aβ formation without impairing cleavage of other γ-secretase substrates, especially Notch, which is essential for normal biological functions 3 , 4 . Here we report the discovery of a novel γ-secretase activating protein (gSAP), which dramatically and selectively increases Aβ production through a mechanism involving its interactions with both γsecretase and its substrate, the amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). gSAP does not interact with Notch nor does it affect its cleavage. Recombinant gSAP stimulates Aβ production in vitro . Reducing gSAP levels in cell lines decreases Aβ levels. Knockdown of gSAP in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease reduces levels of Aβ and plaque development. gSAP represents a new type of γ-secretase regulator that directs enzyme specificity by interacting with a specific substrate. We demonstrate that imatinib, an anti-cancer drug previously found to inhibit Aβ formation without affecting Notch cleavage 5 , achieves its Aβ-lowering effect by preventing gSAP interaction with the γ-secretase substrate, APP-CTF. Thus, gSAP can serve as an Aβ-lowering therapeutic target without affecting other key functions of γ-secretase.

## Methods
For in vitro labeling, resuspended membranes isolated from HEK293 cells were incubated with 20 nM 125 I-G01 for 3 hr at 4°C prior to photolysis at 254 nM for 2 min. For intact cell labeling, HEK293 cells were incubated with 0.1 μM 3 H-G01 in Opti-MEM for 2 hours at 37°C before being transferred to ice for an additional hour. To examine labeling specificity, either membrane preparations or cells were treated with 50 μM unlabeled imatinib together with photoactivatible G01 in parallel assays. Photolysis was conducted on ice for 2 min at 254 nm. After photolysis, membranes or cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPSO with protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with PS1-loop antibody. The immuno-purified material was eluted with SDS sample buffer and proteins were separated using a 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF for autoradiography.

Membrane preparations of HEK293 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , and 1% CHAPSO containing protease inhibitors, Roche Inc.) and incubated with Myone™ streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen) containing bound biotin-imatinib for 3 hr at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with tricine SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 10-20% tris-tricine gels. Silver staining was used to identify protein bands in SDS-PAGE gels. The ~ 16 kDa band was excised, trypsinized, and sequenced by tandem MS/MS mass spectrometry.

Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against gSAP was generated against the peptide CFEGHDNVDAEFVEEAALKHT (corresponding to aa 829-848 of human gSAP with an N-terminal cysteine attached for conjugation). Pulse-chase labeling experiments using neuroblastoma 2a cells were conducted as described 23 . Cells were pulsed for 15 min and the chase periods were initiated by replacing the medium with full culture medium and cells were incubated at 37°C. For continuous labeling, cells were labeled with 35 S Protein Labeling Mix (Perkin Elmer) for 4 hr without chase. Cell monolayers were lysed in RIPA buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with gSAP antibody. The beads were incubated with Tris-tricine sample buffer to elute bound proteins which were then separated by 10-20% Tris-tricine gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane for autoradiography.

For cellular gSAP knockdown experiments, small interfering RNA (siRNA) of gSAP was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. The sequences of the siRNA used were as follows: sense sequence: AUGCAGAGCUGGACGACAUUU; antisense sequence: 5′-P.AUGUCGUCCAGCUCUGCAUUU. Neuroblastoma 2a cell line stably overexpressing APP695 was transfected with siRNA using DharmaFect 2 reagent at a concentration of 50 nM. Non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) was transfected in parallel as control. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of gSAP was purchased from Open Biosystems and transfected into cells using Arrest-In transfection reagent (Open Biosystems). The sequence of human gSAP shRNA in pGIPZ shRNAmir-GFP vector was as follows: TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCGGAAATAGAGTGGTGATTAAATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATTTAATCACCACTCTATTTCCATGCCTACTGCCTCGGA. The knockdown efficiencies were examined using a real time PCR assay with Applied Biosystems 7900 H.T. System.

For gSAP overexpression in cells, mammalian expression vector pReceiver-M07 with the full length gSAP coding a C-terminal HA tag was purchased from Genecopoeia Inc. Plasmid was transfected into a stable HEK293 cell line overexpressing APP695, containing the Swedish mutation, using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). pcDNA4-APP-β-CTF expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. Y.M. Li (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). APPε-CTF construct was derived from the pcDNA4-APP-β-CTF as reported 9 .

The levels of Aβ species were quantified using a highly sensitive ELISA assay from Meso Scale Drug Discoveries. Immunoprecipitation of Aβ was performed as described 5 .

For Notch cleavage analysis, cells transfected with NotchΔE 5 were co-transfected with gSAP-shRNA or gSAP plasmids. After two days of transfection, Notch expression and cleavage were detected with anti-myc antibody. The cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was detected with a cleavage-specific antibody (Notch1 Val-1744, Cell Signaling Inc.). Cells treated with L-685,458 served as controls.

For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , with protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the corresponding antibody and protein G plus/ protein A beads for 2 hr on ice. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblots. Presenilin 1 loop antibody (EMD Biosciences) was used to detect PS1-CTF; PEN-2 antibody was purchased from EMD Biosciences. Nicastrin antibody was from BD Biosciences. HA monoclonal antibody and Myc tag polyclonal antibody were from Genscript Inc. APP-CTF was detected using the 369 antibody 24 . 6E10 and 4G8 antibodies from Covance were used to detect Aβ.

Solubilized membrane preparations from N2a cells (0.2 ml, ~1 mg of solubilized protein, in 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 ) were applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE healthcare) of an AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system. Fractionation was performed in the lysate buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and 1-ml fractions were collected. Endogenous gSAP was detected after immunoprecipitated with gSAP antibody. Each fraction was analyzed by immunoblot using γ-secretase antibodies.

Compound 4, a biotinylated γ-secretase transition state analogue 6 , was a kind gift from Dr. Y.M. Li (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). HEK293 cell lysates in 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 were incubated with compound 4 immobilized on streptavidin Myone™ magnetic beads for 2 hrs at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times with lysate buffer. The captured proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblot analysis.

The in vitro γ-secretase assay was as described 25 except for the use of APP-CTF or NotchΔE overexpressed in HEK293 cells rather than recombinant proteins from E.coli . Recombinant gSAP-16K (aa733-854 of the human gSAP) was expressed in BL21 DE3 E.coli and purified. After 2 hr of 35 S labeling, membrane preparations from HEK293 cells overexpressing APP-CTF were resuspended in 200 μl of assay buffer with 2 μg recombinant gSAP-16K or the same amount of BSA as control. A parallel system with 1 μM L685,458 (γ-secretase inhibitor) was also used as a control. The membrane suspension was pre-incubated at 4 °C for 1 hr and then incubated for 2 hr at 37 °C to allow in vitro generation of Aβ. Aβ was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using 4G8 antibody, separated on 10-20% Tris-tricine gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane for autoradiography.

Inducible RNAi mice were generated by incorporating gSAP shRNA TCCCGGAACTCCATGATTGACAAATTTCAA GAGAATTTGTCAATCATGGAGTTCC TTTTTA into the mouse genome (B6/129S6 background) under the control of a H1-Tet promoter as described 26 (TaconicArtemis Inc.). Heterozygous RNAi mice were then crossed with an AD mouse model with APPswe and PS1Δ9 mutations (AD 2× mice) to generate gSAP-RNAi AD mice for Aβ analyses.

shRNA was induced in 2 month old gSAP RNAi-AD mice with doxycycline for 1 month by adding 2 mg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) into drinking water containing 10% sucrose. Control mice were fed drinking water containing 10% sucrose. gSAP knockdown efficiency in mice was assayed using real time PCR. Aβ levels from mouse hippocampus were measured by ELISA (Wako Chemicals). Intestinal dissection and histochemical staining (H &E and PAS staining) were conducted as described elsewhere 11 .

For immunohistochemistry studies, mouse brains were processed and labeled with the anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (Novus Biologicals) to visualize extracellular amyloid plaques using an M.O.M immunodetection kit (Vector laboratories).
