NMDA-mediated Ca2+influx drives aberrant ryanodine receptor activation in dendrites of young Alzheimer’s disease mice

# Abstract
Deficits in synaptic function, particularly through NMDA receptors, are linked to late-stage cognitive impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). At earlier disease stages however, there is evidence for altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium signaling in human cases and in neurons from AD mouse models. Despite the fundamental importance of calcium to synaptic function, neither the extent of ER calcium dysregulation in dendrites nor its interaction with synaptic function in AD pathophysiology is known. Identifying the mechanisms underlying early synaptic calcium dysregulation in AD pathogenesis is likely a key component to understanding, and thereby preventing, the synapse loss and downstream cognitive impairments. Using 2-photon calcium imaging, flash photolysis of caged glutamate, and patch clamp electrophysiology in cortical brain slices, we examined interactions between synaptically and ER-evoked calcium release at glutamatergic synapses in young AD transgenic mice. We found increased ryanodine receptor-evoked calcium signals within dendritic spine heads, dendritic processes, and the soma of pyramidal neurons from 3xTg-AD and TAS/TPM AD mice relative to NonTg controls. In addition, synaptically-evoked postsynaptic calcium responses were larger in the AD strains, as were calcium signals generated from NMDA receptor activation. However, calcium responses triggered by back-propagating action potentials were not different. Concurrent activation of RyR with either synaptic or NMDAR stimulation generated a supra-additive calcium response in the AD strains, suggesting an aberrant CICR effect within spines and dendrites. We propose that presenilin -linked disruptions in RyR signaling and subsequent CICR via NMDAR-mediated calcium influx alters synaptic function and serves as an early pathogenic factor in AD.

## Introduction
Neurons utilize calcium for a myriad of roles, with functional specificity often determined by cellular localization; for example, calcium release in the nucleus may drive gene transcription while in dendrites it modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity ( Collin et al., 2005 ; Berridge, 2006 ). The source of calcium is also an important factor, extracellular calcium entry occurs through plasma membrane channels such as NMDA receptors (NMDAR), and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), while intracellular reserves from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are liberated through inositol triphosphate (IP 3 R) or ryanodine receptors (RyR) ( Verkhratsky, 2005 ). Importantly, calcium exposure at these channels can facilitate subsequent release through the process of calcium-induced-calcium release (CICR). Given the complexity of interactions among calcium sources and their regenerative potential, neurons tightly regulate calcium signaling to ensure proper function and viability.

Dysregulated calcium signaling is linked to AD pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms ( LaFerla, 2002 ; Stutzmann, 2007 ; Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008 ). The most pronounced effects are associated with mutant presenilin (PS), which causes early onset AD, and increases ER calcium release. In recent studies, we proposed that RyR-evoked calcium release is preferentially enhanced by PS mutations through increased RyR2 expression ( Stutzmann et al., 2006 ; Chakroborty et al., 2009 ), while channel studies have shown that mutant PS alters IP 3 R gating properties ( Cheung et al., 2008 ; 2010 ) or ER leak channel function ( Tu et al., 2006 ; Nelson et al., 2007 ). Regardless of mechanism, the functional implications of increased CICR in 3xTg-AD mouse models are pronounced, resulting in aberrant recruitment of RyR-calcium stores in basal synaptic transmission, SK channel activation, enhanced presynaptic vesicle release, and long-term plasticity in hippocampal neurons ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). These signaling changes are present prior to beta amyloid formation, tau deposits, or memory deficits, and may represent early pathogenic processes that contribute to the histopathological and synaptic deficits that define the later disease stages.

What is not understood is how RyR-mediated calcium increases are triggered in spines and dendrites, and how this affects synaptic responses in AD mice. Therefore, in this study, we examine interactions among several calcium sources in pyramidal neurons from AD and NonTg mouse models, and compare the RyR-mediated contribution in each to gauge differences in calcium dynamics within neuronal microdomains. We found that in mutant PS1-expressing neurons, there is a profound RyR-mediated calcium increase within dendritic processes and spines that can be elicited through direct RyR activation, basal synaptic transmission, NMDAR activation, and synergistic interactions among these stimuli. Notably, calcium signals triggered by VGCC activity is not upregulated, suggesting that enhanced intracellular calcium signals are mediated largely through glutamatergic pathways. Particularly relevant for AD is the involvement of NMDAR-calcium influx and subsequent CICR via aberrant RyR recruitment. This is consistent with a larger body of literature targeting NMDAR-mediated toxicity in AD pathology ( Harkany et al., 1999 ; Shankar et al., 2007 ; Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008 ; Demuro et al., 2010 ) and the hypothesis that breakdown of synapses is a causative factor in AD-linked cognitive decline ( Terry et al., 1991 ; Masliah, 2005; Selkoe, 2008 ).

## Materials and Methods
Two AD mouse models were used in this study in order to validate and confirm the aberrant calcium dynamics in more than model: (i) 3xTg-AD mice generated from the PS1 M146V KI mouse and also expressing APP SWE and Tau P130L (Oddo et al., 2003), and(ii)TAS/TPM double transgenic mice co-expressing PS1 M146V and APP SWE mutations ( Howlett et al., 2004 ). Age- matched (4–6 weeks old) NonTg control mice, based on the same background strain (J29/C57BL6), also were used. Both male and female mice were used in these studies. Animals were cared for and used in accordance with protocols approved by RFUMS Animal Care and Use Committee.

Brain slices (300 μm) containing the prefrontal cortex were prepared as previously described ( Stutzmann et al., 2004 ) and superfused at 2 ml/min with standard aCSF solution containing(in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgSO 4 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25.0 NaHCO 3 , 10 D-dextrose and 0.05 picrotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich) and equilibrated with95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 (pH 7.3–7.4) at room temperature (27°C). Osmolarity was maintained at 310 mOsm. Patch pipettes (4–5 MΩ)were filled with intracellular solution containing the following substances (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 MgCl 2 , 4 NaATP, and 0.4 NaGTP, pH adjusted to 7.3–7.4 with KOH (Sigma), and 50 μM fura-2 (Invitrogen). In experiments using photolysis of MNI-caged-L-glutamate (500 μM; Tocris Bioscience) for NMDAR activation, K-gluconate was replaced with Cs-methylsulfonate in the intracellular solution, and the extracellular solution contained (in μM) CNQX (20), picrotoxin (20), TTX (1) (all from Sigma-Aldrich).

Prefrontal cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were identified visually via IR/DIC optics and electrophysiologically by their passive membrane properties and spike frequency accommodation. Membrane potentials were obtained in current-clamp mode acquired at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1322 A-D converter and Multiclamp 700B amplifier, and recorded and analyzed using pClamp 10.2 (Molecular Devices Corp., Union City, CA). Series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment and was below 10 MΩ. Synaptic stimulation of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons was accomplished by placing a monopolar stimulating electrode in cortical layer II approximately 50–100 μm lateral to the apical dendrite of the layer V neuron. Current pulses were generated using an A360 stimulus isolator (WPI) with a pulse duration of 100 μsec and intensity ranging from 25–75 μA. In all experiments, the stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke a standard reference EPSP of approximately 4mV prior to treatment. Membrane potential was continuously monitored and spontaneous EPSPs were recorded in current clamp mode concurrent with calcium imaging. To verify glutamatergic transmission, EPSPs were blocked by addition of 20 μM of CNQX (Sigma-Aldrich) at the conclusion of each experiment. Analysis of spontaneous EPSPs was accomplished with MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft Corp.).

Ca 2+ imaging within individual neurons was performed in brain slice preparations using a custom-made video-rate multiphoton imaging system based on an upright Olympus BX51 microscope frame ( Stutzmann and Parker, 2005 ). Individual neurons were filled with the calcium indicator, fura-2 (50 μM) via the patch pipette as described ( Stutzmann et al., 2004 ). In these studies, fura-2 is not utilized as a ratiometric dye(primarily because the Ti:Saph laser cannot tune between two excitation wavelengths rapidly enough) but rather, excitation at a single wavelength is used to measure relative changes in fluorescence. We excite fura-2 at the equivalent 380 nm wavelength which generates a bright signal at low calcium levels, allowing us to clearly see small compartments such as spines at resting levels. Upon calcium increases, fluorescence decreases, but it is the relative change in fluorescence that is measured. Laser excitation was provided by trains (80 MHz) of ~100 fs pulses at 780 nm from a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai Broadband, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA). The laser beam was scanned by a resonant galvanometer (General Scanning Lumonics, Waterton, Mass.) allowing rapid (7.9 kHz) bidirectional scanning in the x -axis and by a conventional linear galvanometer in the y -axis, to provide a full frame-scan rate of 30 fps. The laser beam was focused onto the tissue through a 40X water-immersion objective (NA = 0.8). Emitted fluorescence light was detected by a wide-field photomultiplier (Electron Tubes Inc, England) to derive a video signal that was captured and analyzed by Video Savant 5.0 software (IO Industries, Ontario, Canada). Further analysis of background corrected images was performed using Metamorph software. For clarity, pseudocolored images of fura-2 fluorescence are expressed as inverse pseudo-ratios so that increases in [Ca 2+ ] correspond to increasing ratios: F 0 /ΔF (F 0 is the average resting fluorescence at baseline, and ΔF is the decrease of fluorescence upon Ca 2+ release). Data indicating relative percentage changes in fluorescent intensity were calculated as percent over baseline: (F 0 /ΔF-1)*100. UV flash photolysis was accomplished using an X-Cite 120 Fluorescence Illumination system (Photonic Solution Inc.) and UV filter cube (340–400 nm) in a light path separate from the IR laser input, with exposure time controlled through electronic shutters (Uniblitz) operated and synchronized through digital outputs (Digidata 1322) controlled by pClamp 10 software.

Unless otherwise specified, comparison of data across the three transgenic groups utilized a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc analysis to determine significance between groups. For analysis of cumulative event histograms, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used (KS-test). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 or z<0.05.

Cortical tissue was harvested from 1–3-month-old 3xTg and NonTg animals. Tissue was homogenized on ice in Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Invitrogen) containing protease inhibitors (Rouche). Total cortical protein was quantified and separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE ® gradient gels (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Hybond -P) at 30V for two hours under reducing conditions. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Mouse anti-NMDAR1 and rabbit anti-β-Actin primary antibodies (Millipore and Cell Signaling Technologies, respectively) were diluted 1:1000 in 2.5% nonfat milk and applied to membranes for 24 hours at 4°C with shaking. HRP-conjugated goat secondary antibodies were applied for one hour at room temperature. Protein expression was evaluated using Novex ® ECL chemoluminescent substrate (Invitrogen) and a Versa Doc imaging system (BioRad). Densitometric analysis was conducted using Versa Doc software. NMDAR levels are represented as protein expression relative to β-Actin.

## Results
In 3xTg-AD neurons, increased ER calcium release triggers downstream effects on membrane excitability likely via activation of calcium-activated SK channels ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ; Brennan et al., 2008 ). Here, we further investigated how these altered calcium dynamics affect passive and active membrane properties in neurons from the frontal cortex, a brain region highly vulnerable to AD pathology. In control ACSF solution, there were no significant differences in the resting membrane potential (RMP; F (2,82) = 1.2, p=0.31) or membrane input resistance (Ri; F (2,43) = 0.69, p=0.51), among the three mouse lines ( Table 1 , number of cells/group: 32, 15, and 36 for the NonTg, TAS/TPM, and 3xTg-AD strains, respectively). However, stimulating RyRs with caffeine (10mM) significantly increased the membrane hyperpolarization within each mouse model, and the steady-state hyperpolarization was greater in the AD-Tg strains (3xTg-AD, n=12; and TAS/TPM, n=15) compared to the NonTgs (n=13) (F (2,43) = 21.4, p<0.001). Caffeine did not significantly change membrane input resistance (p>0.05).

To measure effects of altered ER calcium release on synaptic responses, a stimulating electrode was placed in the layer II cortical region adjacent to the apical dendrite of the layer V neuron to evoke sub-threshold EPSPs. Synaptically-evoked calcium responses were imaged from spiny apical dendrites approximately 500 μm from the soma. For each neuron, the stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke an EPSP of approximately 4mV from a membrane potential of −70mV ( Fig. 1 ). In control aCSF, the requisite stimulus intensity was not significantly different (F (2,82) =0.08; p=0.92) between the NonTg (65±9.2 μA, n=32), TAS/TPM (60±12.7 μA, n=15) and 3xTg-AD lines (62±10.7 μA, n=36). In NonTg mice, 10mM caffeine did not significantly alter the requisite stimulus intensity (49±4.7 μA; n=13; p>0.05). However, in the AD mice, RyR activation by 10mM caffeine significantly reduced the stimulus intensity required to evoke a 4mV EPSP (TAS/TPM, 33±7.6 μA, n=15; 3xTg-AD, 34±2.32 μA, n=12; p<0.05), indicating that RyR activation can increase synaptic excitability in young AD transgenic strains but not in normal NonTg mice. While synaptic excitability appears normal in AD transgenic mice under control conditions, stimulation with caffeine reveals increased sensitivity to RyR mediated potentiation in AD transgenics. It is possible this is attributable to the increased RyR2 levels observed both the 3xTg-AD mice ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ), as well as in the TAS/TPM mice as demonstrated with qRT-PCR (p<0.05; data not shown).

In order to determine an optimal stimulation protocol that generates a postsynaptic Ca 2+ response yet does not interfere with long term alterations in presynaptic vesicle release properties, we compared a paired pulse facilitation protocol (PPF; 70 ms intervals) at low frequency (0.05 Hz) before and after application of stimulation trains of either 30 Hz or 100 Hz for 1.5 seconds. PPF after 30Hz stimulation show no differences from pre-stimulus conditions across transgenic animal group (data not shown, p>0.05), however, PPF was significantly decreased after 100 Hz stimulation (p<0.05), suggesting that high frequency stimulation altered presynaptic release properties. Therefore, 30Hz stimulation for 1.5 seconds was chosen for subsequent synaptic stimulation/calcium imaging experiments (data not shown).

The ER extends into presynaptic regions and RyRs are found in some synaptic terminals ( Bouchard et al. , 2003 ). Based on this, we next examined how synaptic signaling properties may be affected by enhanced RyR-evoked calcium release in the AD transgenic mice. Spontaneous EPSPs were measured both with and without TTX (1 μM) in the bath, and regardless of caffeine treatment and transgenic strain, there were no differences in their frequency or amplitude with sodium channels blocked (p = 0.65). This likely reflects the lack of spontaneous action potentials within the circuits measured from these cortical brain slice preparations. Therefore, subsequent experiments omitted TTX. In control ACSF, spontaneous EPSP frequency and amplitude were similar across all animal groups (F (2,38) = 0.40; p>0.05 and F (2,38) = 0.15; p>0.05, respectively; Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2B and C , there were no significant differences in the cumulative amplitude and frequency histograms (K-S test; p>0.05) indicating that spontaneous vesicle release probabilities appear similar between AD transgenic animals and NonTg controls under basal conditions. AMPA/kainite glutamatergic synaptic transmission was confirmed at the end of each recording with bath application of CNQX to block spontaneous events. Number of cells per group was 8, 10 and 21 for the NonTg, TAS/TPM, and 3xTg–AD strains, respectively.

We next captured spontaneous events in the presence of 10 mM caffeine to determine if RyR activation unmasks differences in glutamate release at the AD transgenic synapses. Under these conditions, we observe a pronounced increase in the average frequency (F (2,38) = 6.27, p<0.05) of spontaneous events but not in their amplitude (F (2,38) = 1.29, p = 0.33) in both AD transgenic mouse lines compared to the NonTg controls. This is demonstrated by a significant leftward shift in the inter-event cumulative probability histogram ( Fig. 2E ; KS test: 3xTg (n=21) vs NonTg (n=8), z=1.25 p<0.05; TAS/TPM (n=10) vs NonTg (n=8), z=1.8, p<0.01). These data indicate that both the passive membrane properties and synaptic transmission appear normal in both AD transgenic mouse lines under basal conditions at 4–6 weeks of age. Yet, synaptic excitability is significantly increased for the AD transgenic mice upon RyR activation, likely via increased presynaptic glutamate release.

Neurons are highly compartmentalized cells that have distinct calcium signaling requirements within subcellular regions. Therefore, we investigated if the mutant PS1-mediated calcium alterations were of a uniform magnitude across neuronal compartments, or, if regional differences exist as demonstrated in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from 3xTg-AD mice ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). We compared ER calcium release from the soma, proximal dendrites and dendritic spine heads from distal apical branches using bath application of 10 or 20 mM caffeine in the NonTg, 3xTg-AD and TAS/TPM mice. These caffeine concentrations were chosen to establish near-threshold calcium response levels in the NonTg neurons, while still capturing the full range of calcium responses in the AD transgenic mice. Representative pseudocolored images of relative calcium changes in response to RyR stimulation within the soma, dendrites and spines from NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons are shown in Fig. 3A, B . When measuring somatic signals, the region overlying the nucleus was excluded. 10mM caffeine produced threshold RyR-evoked calcium responses in the NonTg neurons, therefore this concentration was used for the remaining experiments unless otherwise indicated. For the TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, significantly greater calcium responses in all compartments were observed relative to the NonTg neurons, with the exception of the soma for the TAS/TPM neurons (ANOVA: soma, F (2,16) = 4.32; p<0.05; NonTg, n=5; TAS/TPM, n=6; 3xTg, n=6: dendrites, (F (2,22) = 10.45; p<0.05; NonTg, n=8; TAS/TPM, n=9; 3xTg, n=6: spines, (F (2,120) = 49.44; p <0.05; NonTg, n=31; TAS/TPM, n=44; 3xTg, n=47). With 20mM caffeine, the AD transgenic mice generate significantly greater calcium responses than NonTg mice in all compartments (ANOVA: soma, (F (2,17) = 4.98; p<0.05, NonTg, n=5; TAS/TPM, n=6; 3xTg, n=6: dendrites, F (2,44) = 3.63; p<0.05; NonTg, n=14; TAS/TPM, n=18; 3xTg, n=13: spines, F (2,147) = 17.36; p<0.05; NonTg, n=53; TAS/TPM, n=39; 3xTg, n=56). Here, the TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD mice had similar calcium responses in the soma and dendrites, but the 3xTg-AD mice still generated greater RyR-evoked calcium signals in the spine heads (p<0.05). In previous studies, we had confirmed that the caffeine application was underlying the aberrant calcium responses, and not working through other signaling pathways ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). Here we also used ryanodine in the pipette during caffeine application, which reduced the evoked calcium response and verifies that caffeine stimulation is triggering the calcium response (data not shown). Given the critical role of dendritic calcium release in modulating synaptic signaling, this scenario sets the stage for altered synaptic function in the AD mice as a consequence of localized aberrant calcium release.

RyR sensitivity appears to be markedly increased in the AD mice, thus relatively small increases in postsynaptic calcium may be sufficient to activate CICR. Previous studies in 3xTg-AD neurons showed that increased RyR-mediated CICR is required for the increased IP 3 R-evoked ER calcium response, as exaggerated IP 3 R-evoked calcium response was normalized to NonTg levels by blocking the RyR during IP 3 R activation ( Stutzmann et al., 2006 ). Here, we tested the converse – whether blocking the IP 3 R while stimulating the RyR could similarly ‘normalize’ the aberrant RyR-mediated calcium release. RyR-stimulation with caffeine was repeated in the presence of the IP 3 R antagonist, heparin, infused into the neuron through the patch pipette. ( Fig. 4 ). Isolating the RyR ER-calcium response in this manner resulted in markedly different calcium responses both within and between mouse models, and was based largely on cellular compartment. Heparin significantly lowered the caffeine-evoked calcium signal only in the soma of 3xTg-AD neurons (F (1,12) = 12.77; p < 0.01). However, unlike the complementary experiment in which dantrolene normalized the IP 3 -evoked calcium response to NonTg levels, heparin did not completely reverse the RyR-calcium response back to NonTg levels ( Fig. 4 ), and a significantly greater RyR-response remained in the 3xTg-AD soma (n=6) relative to the NonTg soma (n=7) (F (1,12) = 5.08, p = < 0.05).

In dendritic compartments, heparin had little effect on the caffeine-evoked RyR-calcium response in either the NonTg (dendrites, n=16; spines, n=83) or 3xTg-AD neurons (dendrites, n=10; F (1,25) =0.23; p=0.97; and spines: n=68; F (1,150) = 0.43; p=0.52). Notably, heparin’s reduction of the somatic ER calcium response in 3xTg neurons occurred in the absence of exogenously-applied or stimulated IP 3 , suggesting that endogenous basal levels of IP 3 may be sufficient to generate an IP 3 R response when combined with calcium release through RyR.

In light of the pronounced RyR-evoked calcium responses in synaptic regions from mutant PS1-expressing mice, we next explored how this may affect synaptically-generated signals from both a calcium signaling and electrical excitability perspective. Here, synaptically-evoked calcium signals were elicited by stimulating afferent fibers impinging on layer V cortical pyramidal neurons using a 30 Hz stimulus frequency. Evoked calcium signals were captured in the following sequence: 30 seconds in control ACSF, followed by 1.5 seconds of 30 Hz stimulation, a 30 second delay, 1 minute of bath-applied caffeine (10 mM), followed by 1.5 seconds of synaptic stimulation in caffeine, then several (2–10) minutes of washout. The averaged maximal calcium response and representative EPSPs during synaptic stimulation are shown for each condition in Fig 5 . Interestingly, 30 Hz synaptic stimulation alone generates a greater postsynaptic calcium response in spine heads and distal processes from the AD mice in comparison to NonTg mice. Although this occurs in the absence of exogenous RyR activation, the increased calcium is mediated via CICR as ryanodine (30 μM) in the patch pipette blocks this effect. To further examine the interaction between RyR and synaptically-evoked calcium responses, we then stimulated presynaptic fibers in 10mM caffeine and measured the combined calcium response in postsynaptic dendrites and spines integrated over a 1.5 second time period. In the AD transgenic mice there was a pronounced synergistic calcium response with coincident RyR and synaptic stimulation that exceeded either calcium response in isolation (ANOVA; F (2,319) =50.6; p<0.01; n=132, 122, and 166 for NonTg, TAS/TPM, and 3xTg-AD strains, respectively). It should be noted that when data are shown for the synaptic stimulation + caffeine conditions, the caffeine-evoked calcium response has been subtracted out, thereby isolating the calcium signal resulting from the coincident stimulation. In NonTg spines and dendrites, concurrent RyR and synaptic stimulation did not trigger additional calcium release, consistent with a lower threshold for CICR. We further confirmed the contribution of RyR-mediated calcium release in the AD mice by including ryanodine in the patch pipette and repeating the synaptic stimulation protocol. Blocking the RyR eliminates both the isolated and synergistic elevation of calcium in the AD neurons F (2,262) =150.6 (p<0.001; n=78, 102, and 83 for NonTg, TAS/TPM, 3xTg-AD strains, respectively).

NMDAR-mediated calcium influx provides a significant source of calcium entry through plasma membrane channels, and upregulation of NMDAR activity is implicated as a mechanism in AD pathology. Indeed, several therapeutic approaches either currently in use or under investigation to preserve cognitive function in AD target NMDAR ( Yamin, 2009 ; Doody et al., 2008 ; Burns and Jacoby, 2008 ). However, direct observation of NMDAR-mediated calcium signaling in AD models has yet to be examined. In this series of experiments, this is addressed by pharmacologically isolating and subsequently activating NMDAR through photolysis of caged glutamate in the presence of CNQX and picrotoxin, and comparing whole cell currents and dendritic calcium responses in AD and NonTg neurons. The membrane potential was voltage-clamped at −70 mV and APV was included at the conclusion of all trials to confirm NMDAR activity. As shown in Fig. 6 , isolated NMDA currents were not different among the mouse strains, however, the evoked dendritic spine calcium responses were significantly greater in both AD strains relative to NonTg (ANOVA (F (2,360) =26.53; p<0.05: n = 110, 134, and 117 in the NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, respectively). Blocking the RyR in AD neurons prevented the enhanced NMDA calcium responses and normalized them to NonTg levels. This indicates that the additional calcium came from RyR-mediated CICR in the AD mice, and, that this CICR facilitation via NMDAR activation does not occur in the NonTg mice ( Fig. 6A, B ; ANOVA; F (2,207) =8.817, p<0.05: n = 136, 70, and 102 in the NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, respectively).

We next asked if direct RyR activation concurrent with NMDAR stimulation can generate supra-additive calcium responses in the dendrites of AD neurons, as observed with synaptic stimulation. The MNI-glutamate photolysis protocol was repeated as above but now included bath application of 10 mM caffeine. Similar to the dynamics observed with synaptic stimulation, the coincident activation of RyR and NMDAR resulted in a further calcium increase in the AD Tg mice only; there were no additional effects in the NonTg mice under these conditions ( Fig. 6A, B ; ANOVA; F (2,360) =26.53; p<0.001: n = 110, 134, and 117 in the NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, respectively). The evoked NMDA whole cell currents were not significantly different among mouse lines, nor did caffeine exposure change the magnitude of the currents ( Fig. 6C ). This supports increased CICR via the RyR as the mechanism underlying the NMDAR-mediated enhanced calcium responses rather than increased calcium flux directly through NMDAR. Consistent with these findings, cortical NMDAR protein levels were not different between the NonTg mice (n=6) and the 3xTg-AD mice (n=7) ( Fig. 6D, E ).

Calcium entry through VGCC provides another large calcium source in dendrites and spines. We wished to extend the observations made with synaptically-mediated CICR changes in the AD mice and determine if VGCC entry is similarly upregulated and plays a role in the increased synaptically-evoked calcium responses. VGCCs were activated by dendritic depolarization via back propagating action potentials (bAPs) generated at the soma. A series of 7–10 action potentials were triggered by depolarizing current injections (500 ms, 40 pA over threshold current) with picrotoxin (10 μM) and APV (50 μM) included in the bath solution. Under these conditions, there were no significant differences in the integrated or peak calcium responses in dendritic spines among the mouse strains ( Fig. 7 ; ANOVA: F (2,79) = 2.13; p = 0.23: n = 25, 28, and 37 in the NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, respectively ), consistent with previous studies examining bAP responses in the soma of AD neurons ( Stutzmann et al., 2004 ; 2006 ). To determine if RyR stimulation in parallel with VGCC activation can generate exaggerated CICR, caffeine was bath applied concurrent with bAPs, and calcium responses measured in the same spines. Again, there were no significant differences among the mouse strains, nor were any supra-additive calcium responses generated (ANOVA: F (2,79) = 3.43; p = 0.12: n = 25, 28, and 37 in the NonTg, TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD neurons, respectively). Lastly, the calcium channel blocker Cd 2+ (100 μM) was washed in to confirm VGCC activity.

## Discussion
Increased ER calcium release in mutant PS-expressing neurons is well-documented and the contribution of calcium dyshomeostasis to AD pathogenesis is increasingly validated ( LaFerla, 2002 ; Stutzmann, 2007 ; Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008 ). Previous studies have demonstrated increases in somatic RyR-evoked calcium release in mutant PS1-expressing neurons which is consistent with increased RyR expression ( Smith et al., 2005 ; Stutzmann et al., 2006 ), and increased RyR2 mRNA levels specifically ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). Elevated RyRs have also been observed in human AD cases early in the disease process ( Kelliher et al., 1999 ; O’Neill et al., 2001 ). With this, calcium dysregulation in sporadic AD is also evident, with Aβ peptides, hyperphosphorylated tau and ApoE4 expression altering neuronal calcium signaling ( Stutzmann, 2007 ).

Despite the evidence implicating dysregulated calcium signaling in AD pathogenesis, the corresponding downstream consequences on neurophysiology have yet to be explored in detail. Considering that loss of synapses is correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment in AD, and, that calcium signaling is fundamental to synaptic function and integrity, we explored the extent of calcium signaling dysregulation within spines and dendrites in AD neurons and tested the hypothesis that aberrant CICR via the RyR underlies synaptic signaling pathology prior to the onset of cognitive deficits. We found in cortical neurons from presymptomatic TAS/TPM and 3xTg-AD mice relative to NonTg mice that: i . the patterns of RyR-evoked calcium elevation differ significantly within different neuronal compartments, with dendrites and spines displaying the greatest sensitivity to RyR activation in the AD mice, ii. postsynaptic calcium responses are exaggerated in dendritic processes and spine heads in response to synaptic stimulation, as are calcium responses evoked by NMDAR activation, iii. there is likely a RyR-dependent presynaptic effect on neurotransmitter vesicle release that is unique to the AD transgenic mice, and iv. dendritic processes and spines show synergistic CICR upon co-activation of synaptic inputs and RyRs.

In pyramidal neurons, the RyR is found throughout the neuron including presynaptic terminals, distal dendritic processes and dendritic spine heads - of which approximately 50% contain smooth ER ( Hertle and Yeckel, 2007 ; Spacek and Harris, 1997 ). In these subcellular domains, RyRs are optimally positioned to modulate synaptic signaling and plasticity through tuning of calcium release within both spatial and temporal domains. We observe here a significant increase in the RyR-evoked calcium response in several cellular compartments in the AD mice, with the greatest relative increases occurring in distal dendrites and spines, which are the key sites of synaptic contacts that support neurotransmission and plasticity. The mechanism underlying the increased calcium release may reflect an impaired ER leak channel ascribed to mutant presenilin, thereby resulting in a general increase in ER calcium store levels ( Tu et al., 2006 ; Nelson et al., 2007 ). The broader implications of these findings are consistent with the RyR-mediated alterations in short and long forms of hippocampal plasticity and synaptic strength in young 3xTg-AD neurons ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ).

Reciprocal CICR dynamics between IP 3 R- and RyR-mediated calcium release can exist in neurons, such that calcium released through IP 3 R can facilitate RyR-release and vice-versa . This may be the mechanism by which photoreleased IP 3 generates an enhanced RyR calcium response in mutant PS1-expressing neurons. In this scenario, blocking the RyR normalizes the IP 3 -evoked calcium response in mutant PS1-expressing neurons but has no effect in NonTg neurons ( Stutzmann et al., 2006 ). Here, we examined if RyR-evoked calcium release can facilitate an IP 3 R calcium response in the AD mice, thereby questioning if there is an equivalent degree of CICR reciprocity between the channels. We found that blocking the IP 3 R reduced the RyR-calcium signal in the soma of 3xTg-AD neurons, yet, the total evoked calcium response was still greater than the NonTg response. This suggests that mutant PS can facilitate the sensitivity of both the IP 3 and Ry channels to calcium, but the effect is most profound on the RyR and only observed in the soma. This is consistent with the IP 3 R distribution in pyramidal neurons, which is predominantly in the soma and proximal dendrites, while RyRs are also found in distal processes and spines ( Hertle and Yeckel, 2007 ; Nicolay et al., 2007 ; Fitzpatrick et al., 2009 ). This experiment also allows us to indirectly examine if mutant presenilin sensitizes IP 3 channel gating properties, as proposed by Cheung et al., 2008 , 2010 . In the absence of exogenously applied IP 3 , an IP 3 - calcium response is generated upon RyR-evoked calcium release in mutant PS1-expressing neurons, yet not in the NonTg neurons, consistent with enhanced IP 3 R modal gating ( Cheung et al., 2008 ; 2010 ). As calcium is a co-agonist of the IP 3 R, the increased RyR-evoked calcium release in concert with basal levels of endogenous IP 3 exposure may now be sufficient to evoke an IP 3 R response in AD but not NonTg mice.

In light of the profound RyR-mediated calcium increases in synapse-dense regions, we next asked how this might impact synaptic function. Baseline synaptic transmission and passive membrane properties in young AD transgenic mice appeared similar to NonTg mice under control conditions. Yet, the appearance of normalcy may reflect compensatory mechanisms normalizing an aberrant RyR-mediated calcium contribution ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). With RyR stimulation, differences between NonTg and AD transgenics now emerge in synaptic transmission and membrane excitability properties. For example, RyR-activation generates a greater hyperpolarized membrane potential in the AD transgenic mice than in NonTg controls. This may be related to an increased coupling efficiency between the RyR and the calcium-activated SK channel in mutant PS1 expressing neurons ( Stutzmann et al., 2006 ; Brennan et al., 2008 : Chakroborty et al., 2009 ). Presynaptic differences in RyR-evoked calcium release are also inferred from a selective increase in the frequency, but not amplitude, of mEPSPs. These presynaptic dynamics are consistent with increased transmitter release upon RyR activation, and therefore may also relate to the reduced current strength required to generate a similar postsynaptic EPSP. At CA3-CA1 synapses, presenilin has a selective presynaptic role in activity-dependent neurotransmitter release that is dependent upon RyR-sensitive calcium stores ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). Purported ‘gain of function’ PS mutations may therefore result in upregulated calcium release in presynaptic terminals and accelerated vesicle depletion, which is consistent with the increased contribution of RyR stores to synaptic transmission and presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from mutant PS1-expressing mice ( Chakroborty et al., 2009 ).

Independent of exogenous RyR activation, physiological synaptic stimulation results in exaggerated dendritic calcium signals in the AD transgenic neurons. The underlying mechanism may reflect a reduced CICR threshold, such that Ca 2+ entry through plasma membrane channels is sufficient to elicit a RyR-evoked calcium response and amplify local calcium levels. In neocortical pyramidal cells, the main sources of calcium influx in spines are voltage-dependent calcium channels ( Sabatini and Svoboda, 2000 ) and NMDARs ( Keller et al., 2008 ). While it is possible that these calcium sources are also being altered by mutant PS1 expression, previous studies have shown that voltage-dependent calcium dynamics and calcium decay kinetics are not different between NonTg and mutant PS1-expressing models ( Stutzmann et al., 2004 ; 2006 ). Likewise, NMDA-mediated currents were not different in the AD mice, nor were NMDA protein levels.

Altered CICR dynamics in spines and dendrites from mutant PS expressing neurons were also observed when RyRs were activated concurrently with synaptic stimulation. Here, a far greater and synergistic calcium response is generated in the dendrites and spines of AD transgenic neurons, with only marginal interactions observed in the NonTg mice. This aberrant CICR effect is observed with both synaptically-evoked calcium transients, as well as isolated NMDA activation, implicating glutamatergic transmission while excluding involvement of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Direct molecular interactions between the RyR2 isoform and NR2B subunits have been described in cardiac muscle ( Seeber et al., 2004 ); if such a complex exists in central neurons, it is possible that this coupling or functional interaction is enhanced in the AD models, although this has yet to be examined. The downstream effects of this increased calcium response may exert more global physiological effects such as a net decrease in membrane excitability via increased activation of calcium-dependent mAHP currents via SK channels ( Stutzmann et al., 2006 ; Brennan et al., 2008 ). The intermittent yet lifelong exposure to grossly elevated calcium transients within spine heads and distal processes may result in structural defects and functional abnormalities in synaptic transmission and contribute to the devastating cognitive deficits in AD ( Jones et al., 2008 ; Korkotian & Segal, 2007 ; Matsuzaki et al. , 2004 ).
