# Title
Association analyses of 249,796 individuals reveal eighteen new loci
associated with body mass index

# Abstract
Obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but the underlying
genetic factors remain largely elusive. To identify genetic loci for
obesity-susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index (BMI)
and ~2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals, with targeted follow-up of
42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known
obesity-susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with BMI
( P <5×10 −8 ), one of which
includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci
( MC4R, POMC, SH2B1, BDNF ) map near key hypothalamic
regulators of energy balance, and one is near GIPR , an incretin
receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly-associated loci may provide novel
insights into human body weight regulation.

## Results
We first conducted a meta-analysis of GWA studies of BMI and ~2.8 million
imputed or genotyped SNPs using data from 46 studies including up to 123,865
individuals ( Online
Methods , Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note ). This stage 1
analysis revealed 19 loci associated with BMI at P <
5×10 −8 ( Table
1 , Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). These 19
loci included all ten loci from previous GWA studies of BMI 6 – 10 ,
two loci previously associated with body weight 10 ( FAIM2 and SEC16B ) and one locus previously
associated with waist circumference 14 (near TFAP2B ). The remaining six loci, near GPRC5B,
MAP2K5/LBXCOR1, TNNI3K, LRRN6C, FLJ35779/HMGCR, and PRKD1, have not
previously been associated with BMI or other obesity-related traits.

To identify additional BMI-associated loci and to validate the loci that
reached genome-wide significance in stage 1 analyses, we examined SNPs
representing 42 independent loci (including the 19 genome-wide significant loci)
with stage 1 P < 5×10 −6 . Variants
were considered to be independent if the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD; r 2 ) was less than 0.1 and if they were separated
by at least 1 Mb. In stage 2, we examined these 42 SNPs in up to 125,931
additional individuals (79,561 newly genotyped individuals from 16 different
studies and 46,370 individuals from 18 additional studies for which GWA data
were available; Table 1 , Supplementary Note , and Online Methods ). In a
joint analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 results, 32 of the 42 SNPs reached P < 5×10 −8 . Even after
excluding SNPs within these 32 confirmed BMI loci, we still observed an excess
of small P -values compared to the distribution expected under
the null hypothesis ( Fig. 1b ), suggesting
that more BMI loci remain to be uncovered.

The 32 confirmed associations included all 19 loci with P < 5×10 −8 at stage 1, 12
additional novel loci near RBJ/ADCY3/POMC , QPCTL/GIPR,
SLC39A8, TMEM160, FANCL, CADM2, LRP1B, PTBP2, MTIF3/GTF3A, ZNF608,
RPL27A/TUB, NUDT3/HMGA1 , and one locus ( NRXN3 )
previously associated with waist circumference 15 ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 1 and
2 ). In all, our study increased the number of loci robustly
associated with BMI from 10 to 32. Four of the 22 new loci were previously
associated with body weight 10 or waist
circumference 14 , 15 , whereas 18 loci had not previously associated
with any obesity-related trait in the general population. Whilst we confirmed
all loci previously established by large-scale GWA studies for BMI 6 – 10 and waist circumference 14 , 15 , four loci identified by GWA studies for
early-onset or adult morbid obesity 16 , 17 [at NPC1 (rs1805081; P = 0.0025), MAF (rs1424233; P = 0.25), PTER (rs10508503; P = 0.64), and TNKS/MSRA (rs473034; P =
0.23)] showed limited or no evidence of association with BMI in our
study.

As expected, the effect sizes of the 18 newly discovered loci are
slightly smaller, for a given minor allele frequency, than those of the
previously identified variants ( Table 1 and Fig. 1c ). The increased sample size
also brought out more signals with low minor allele frequency. The
BMI-increasing allele frequencies for the 18 newly identified variants ranged
from 4% to 87%, covering more of the allele frequency spectrum
than previous, smaller GWA studies of BMI (24%–83%) 9 , 10 ( Table 1 and Fig. 1c ).

We tested for evidence of non-additive (dominant or recessive) effects,
SNP×SNP interaction effects and heterogeneity by sex or study among the
32 BMI-associated SNPs ( Online
Methods ). We found no evidence for any such effects
( P > 0.001, no significant results after correcting for
multiple testing) ( Supplementary Tables 1 and Supplementary Note ).

Together, the 32 confirmed BMI loci explained 1.45% of the
inter-individual variation in BMI of the stage 2 samples, with the FTO SNP accounting for the largest proportion of the
variance (0.34%) ( Table 1 ). To
estimate the cumulative effect of the 32 variants on BMI, we constructed a
genetic-susceptibility score that sums the number of BMI-increasing alleles
weighted by the overall stage 2 effect sizes in the ARIC study (N =
8,120), one of our largest population-based studies ( Online Methods ). For each unit
increase in the genetic-susceptibility score, approximately equivalent to one
additional risk allele, BMI increased by 0.17 kg/m 2 , equivalent to a
435–551 g gain in body weight in adults of 160–180 cm in height.
The difference in average BMI between individuals with a high
genetic-susceptibility score (≥38 BMI-increasing alleles, 1.5%
(n=124) of the ARIC sample) and those with a low genetic-susceptibility
score (≤21 BMI-increasing alleles, 2.2% (n=175) of the
ARIC sample) was 2.73 kg/m 2 , equivalent to a 6.99 to 8.85 kg body
weight difference in adults 160–180 cm in height ( Fig. 2a ). Still, we note that the predictive value for
obesity risk and BMI of the 32 variants combined was modest, although
statistically significant ( Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. 4 ).
The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for prediction
of risk of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) using age,
age 2 and sex only was 0.515 ( P = 0.023
compared to AUC of 0.50), which increased to 0.575 ( P <
10 −5 ) when also the 32 confirmed SNPs were included in
the model ( Fig. 2b ). The area under the ROC
for the 32 SNPs only was 0.574 ( P <
10 −5 ).

All 32 confirmed BMI-increasing alleles showed directionally consistent
effects on risk of being overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 ) or obese
(≥30 kg/m 2 ) in stage 2 samples, with 30 of 32 variants
achieving at least nominally significant associations. The BMI-increasing
alleles increased the odds of overweight by 1.013 to 1.138-fold, and the odds
for being obese by 1.016- to 1.203-fold ( Supplementary Table 2 ). In
addition, 30 of the 32 loci also showed directionally consistent effects on the
risk of extreme and early-onset obesity in a meta-analysis of seven case-control
studies of adults and children (binomial sign test P =
1.3×10 −7 ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The
BMI-increasing allele observed in adults also increased the BMI in children and
adolescents with directionally consistent effects observed for 23 of the 32 SNPs
(binomial sign test P = 0.01). Furthermore, in
family-based studies, the BMI-increasing allele was over-transmitted to the
obese offspring for 24 of the 32 SNPs (binomial sign test P = 0.004) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). As these studies in extreme obesity cases,
children and families were relatively small (N range = 354
− 15,251) compared to the overall meta-analyses, their power was likely
insufficient to confirm association for all 32 loci. Nevertheless, these results
show that the effects are unlikely to reflect population stratification and that
they extend to BMI differences throughout the life course.

All BMI-increasing alleles were associated with increased body weight,
as expected from the correlation between BMI and body weight ( Supplementary Table 2 ). To confirm
an effect of the loci on adiposity rather than general body size, we tested
association with body fat percentage, which was available in a subset of the
stage 2 replication samples (n = 5,359–28,425) ( Supplementary Table 2 ). The
BMI-increasing allele showed directionally consistent effects on body fat
percentage at 31 of the 32 confirmed loci (binomial sign test P = 1.54×10 −8 ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ).

We also examined the association of the BMI loci with metabolic traits
(type 2 diabetes 18 , fasting glucose,
fasting insulin, indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) 19 , and blood lipid
levels 20 ) and with height ( Supplementary Tables 2 and
4 ). Although many nominal associations are expected because of known
correlations between BMI and most of these traits and because of overlap in
samples, several associations stand out as possible examples of pleiotropic
effects of the BMI-associated variants. Particularly interesting is the variant
in the GIPR locus where the BMI-increasing allele is also
associated with increased fasting glucose levels and lower 2-hour glucose levels
( Supplementary Table
4 ) 19 , 21 . The direction of the effect is opposite to what
would be expected due to the correlation between obesity and glucose
intolerance, but is consistent with the suggested roles of GIPR in glucose and energy metabolism (see below) 22 . Three loci show strong associations ( P <
10 −4 ) with height ( MC4R , RBJ/ADCY3/POMC and MTCH2/NDUFS3 ). Because
BMI is weakly correlated with height (and indeed, the BMI-associated variants as
a group show no consistent effect on height), these associations are also
suggestive of pleiotropy. Interestingly, analogous to the effects of severe
mutations in POMC and MC4R on height and
weight 23 , 24 , the BMI-increasing alleles of the variants near
these genes were associated with decreased ( POMC ) and increased
( MC4R ) height, respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ).

Although associated variants typically implicate genomic regions rather
than individual genes, we note that some of the 32 loci include candidate genes
with established connections to obesity. Several of the 10 previously identified
loci are located in or near genes that encode neuronal regulators of appetite or
energy balance, including MC4R 12 , 25 , BDNF 26 , and SH2B1 11 , 27 . Each of these genes has been tied to
obesity, not only in animal models, but also by rare human variants that disrupt
each of these genes and lead to severe obesity 24 , 28 , 29 . Using the automated literature search programme,
Snipper ( Online
Methods ), we identified various genes within the novel loci with
potential biological links to obesity-susceptibility ( Supplementary Note ). Among the
novel loci, the location of rs713586 near POMC provides further
support for a role of neuroendocrine circuits that regulate energy balance in
susceptibility to obesity. POMC encodes several polypeptides
including α-MSH, a ligand of the MC4R gene product 30 , and rare mutations in POMC also cause human obesity 23 , 29 , 31 .

In contrast, the locus near GIPR, which encodes a
receptor of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), suggests a role for peripheral
biology in obesity. GIP, which is expressed in the K cell of the duodenum and
intestine, is an incretin hormone that mediates incremental insulin secretion in
response to oral intake of glucose. The variant associated with BMI is in strong
LD ( r 2 = 0.83) with a missense SNP in GIPR (rs1800437, Glu354Gln) that has recently been shown to
influence the glucose and insulin response to an oral glucose challenge 21 . Although no human phenotype is known to
be caused by mutations in GIPR , mice with disruption of Gipr are resistant to diet-induced obesity 32 . The association of a variant in GIPR with BMI suggests that there may be a link between
incretins/insulin secretion and body weight regulation in humans as well.

To systematically identify biological connections among the genes
located near the 32 confirmed SNPs, and to potentially identify new pathways
associated with BMI, we performed pathway-based analyses using MAGENTA 33 . Specifically, we tested for enrichment
of BMI genetic associations in biological processes or molecular functions that
contain at least one gene from the 32 confirmed BMI loci ( Online Methods ). Using annotations
from the KEGG, Ingenuity, PANTHER, and Gene Ontology databases, we found
evidence of enrichment for pathways involved in the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) signaling (PANTHER, P = 0.0008, FDR = 0.0061),
translation elongation (PANTHER, P = 0.0008, FDR = 0.0066),
hormone or nuclear hormone receptor binding (Gene Ontology, P < 0.0005, FDR
< 0.0085), homeobox transcription (PANTHER, P = 0.0001, FDR =
0.011), regulation of cellular metabolism (Gene Ontology, P = 0.0002,
FDR = 0.031), neurogenesis and neuron differentiation (Gene Ontology, P
< 0.0002, FDR < 0.034), protein phosphorylation (PANTHER, P =
0.0001, FDR = 0.045) and numerous other pathways related to growth,
metabolism, immune and neuronal processes (Gene Ontology, P < 0.002, FDR <
0.046) ( Supplementary Table
5 ).

We used data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the HapMap Consortium to
explore whether the 32 confirmed BMI SNPs were in LD
( r 2 ≥ 0.75) with common missense SNPs or
copy number variants (CNVs) ( Online Methods ). Non-synonymous variants in LD with our signals were
present in the BDNF, SLC39A8, FLJ35779/HMGCR, QPCTL/GIPR, MTCH2,
ADCY3, and LBXCOR1 genes. In addition, the
rs7359397 signal was in LD with coding variants in several genes including SH2B1, ATNX2L, APOB48R, SULT1A2, and AC138894.2 ( Table 1 , Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ).
Furthermore, two SNPs tagged common CNVs. The first CNV was previously
identified and is a 45-kb deletion near NEGR1 9 . The second CNV is a 21-kb deletion that lies 50kb
upstream of GPRC5B; the deletion allele is tagged by the
T-allele of rs12444979 ( r 2 = 1) ( Fig. 3 ). Although the correlations with
potentially functional variants does not prove that these variants are indeed
causal, these provide first clues as to which genes and variants at these loci
might be prioritized for fine-mapping and functional follow-up.

As many of the 32 BMI loci harbor multiple genes, we examined whether
gene expression (eQTL) analyses could also direct us to positional candidates.
Gene expression data were available for human brain, lymphocytes, blood,
subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, and liver 34 – 36 ( Online Methods , Table 1 and Supplementary Table 7 ). Significant cis -associations, defined at the tissue-specific level,
were observed between 14 BMI-associated alleles and expression levels ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 7 ). In several
cases, the BMI-associated SNP was the most significant SNP or explained a
substantial proportion of the association with the most significant SNP for the
gene transcript in conditional analyses
( P adj >0.05). These significant associations
included NEGR1, ZC3H4 , TMEM160 , MTCH2 , NDUFS3 , GTF3A,
ADCY3 , APOB48R , SH2B1 , TUFM , GPRC5B , IQCK , SLC39A8 , SULT1A1 , and SULT1A2 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table
7 ), making these genes higher priority candidates within the
associated loci. However, we note that some BMI-associated variants were
correlated with the expression of multiple nearby genes, making it difficult to
determine the most relevant gene.

Because the variants identified by this large study explain only
1.45% of the variance in BMI (2–4% of genetic variance
based on an estimated heritability of 40–70%), we considered how
much the explained phenotypic variance could be increased by including more SNPs
at various degrees of significance in a polygene model using an independent
validation set ( Online
Methods ) 37 . We found that
including SNPs associated with BMI at lower significance levels (up to P > 0.05) increased the explained phenotypic variance in
BMI to 2.5%, or 4% to 6% of genetic variance ( Fig. 4a ). In a separate analysis, we
estimated the total number of independent BMI-associated variants that are
likely to exist with similar effect sizes to the 32 confirmed here ( Online Methods ) 38 . Based on the effect size and allele
frequencies of the 32 replicated loci observed in stage 2 and the power to
detect association in the combined stage 1 and stage 2, we estimated that there
are 284 (95% CI: 132–510) loci with similar effect sizes as the
currently observed ones, which together would account for 4.5%
(95% CI: 3.1–6.8%) of the variation in BMI or
6–11% of the genetic variation (based on an estimated
heritability of 40–70%) ( Supplementary Table 8 ). In order to
detect 95% of these loci, a sample size of approximately 730,000
subjects would be needed ( Fig. 4b ). This
method does not account for the potential of loci of smaller effect than those
identified here to explain even more of the variance and thus provides an
estimated lower bound of explained variance. These two analyses strongly suggest
that larger GWA studies will continue to identify additional novel associated
loci, but also indicate that even extremely large studies focusing on variants
with allele frequencies above 5% will not account for a large fraction
of the genetic contribution to BMI.

We examined whether selecting only a single variant from each locus for
follow-up led us to underestimate the fraction of phenotypic variation explained
by the associated loci. To search for additional independent loci at each of the
32 associated BMI loci, we repeated our GWA meta-analysis, conditioning on the
32 confirmed SNPs. Using a significance threshold of 5 ×
10 −6 for SNPs at known loci, we identified one apparently
independent signal at the MC4R locus; rs7227255 was associated
with BMI ( P = 6.56 × 10 −7 )
even after conditioning for the most strongly associated variant near MC4R (rs571312) ( Fig.
5 ). Interestingly, rs7227255 is in perfect LD (r 2 = 1) with a relatively rare MC4R missense variant
(rs2229616, V103I, minor allele frequency = 1.7%) that has been
associated with BMI in two independent meta-analyses 39 , 40 .
Furthermore, mutations at the MC4R locus are known to influence
early-onset obesity 24 , 41 , supporting the notion that allelic heterogeneity
may be a frequent phenomenon in the genetic architecture of obesity.

## Discussion
Using a two-stage genome-wide association meta-analysis of up to 249,796
individuals of European descent, we have identified 18 additional loci that are
associated with BMI at genome-wide significance, bringing the total number of such
loci to 32. We estimate that more than 250 (i.e. 284 predicted loci – 32
confirmed loci) common variant loci with effects on BMI similar to those described
here remain to be discovered, and even larger numbers of loci with smaller effects.
A substantial proportion of these loci should be identifiable through larger GWA
studies and/or by targeted follow-up of top signals selected from our stage 1
analysis. The latter approach is already being implemented through large-scale
genotyping of samples informative for BMI using a custom array (the Metabochip)
designed to support follow-up of thousands of promising variants in hundreds of
thousands of individuals.

The combined effect on BMI of the associated variants at the 32 loci is
modest, and even when we try to account for as-yet-undiscovered variants with
similar properties, we estimate that these common variant signals account for only
6–11% of the genetic variation in BMI. There is a strong expectation
that additional variance and biology will be explained using complementary
approaches that capture variants not examined in the current study, such as lower
frequency variants and short insertion-deletion polymorphisms. There is good reason
to believe (based on our findings at MC4R and other loci – POMC, BDNF, SH2B1 – which feature both common
and rare variant associations) that a proportion of such low-frequency and rare
causal variation will map to the loci already identified by GWA studies.

A primary goal of human genetic discovery is to improve understanding of the
biology of conditions such as obesity 42 . One
particularly interesting finding in this regard is the association between BMI and
common variants near GIPR , which may indicate a causal contribution
of variation in postprandial insulin secretion to the development of obesity. In
most cases, the loci identified by the present study harbor few, if any, annotated
genes with clear connections to the biology of weight regulation. This reflects our
still limited understanding of the biology of BMI and obesity-related traits and is
in striking contrast with the results from equivalent studies of certain other
traits (such as autoimmune diseases or lipid levels). Thus, these results suggest
that much novel biology remains to be uncovered, and that GWA studies may provide an
important entry point. In particular, further examination of the associated loci
through a combination of resequencing and fine-mapping to find causal variants, and
genomic and experimental studies designed to assign function, could uncover novel
insights into the biology of obesity.

In conclusion, we have performed GWA studies in large samples to identify
numerous genetic loci associated with variation in BMI, a common measure of obesity.
Because current lifestyle interventions are largely ineffective in addressing the
challenges of growing obesity 43 , 44 , new insights into biology are critically
needed to guide the development and application of future therapies and
interventions.
