# Abstract
To determine whether genotypes at CLU , PICALM, and CR1 confer risk for
                        Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and whether risk for AD associated with
                        these genes is influenced by APOE genotypes. Association study of AD and CLU , PICALM , CR1 and APOE genotypes. Academic research institutions in the United States, Canada, and
                        Israel. 7,070 AD cases, 3,055 with autopsies, and 8,169 elderly cognitively
                        normal controls, 1,092 with autopsies from 12 different studies, including
                        Caucasians, African Americans, Israeli-Arabs, and Caribbean Hispanics. Unadjusted, CLU [odds ratio (OR) =
                        0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.85 – 0.96 for
                        single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11136000], CR1 (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.07 –
                        1.22, SNP rs3818361), and PICALM (OR = 0.89, CI
                        = 0.84 – 0.94, SNP rs3851179) were associated with AD in
                        Caucasians. None were significantly associated with AD in the other ethnic
                        groups. APOE ε4 was significantly associated with
                        AD (ORs from 1.80 to 9.05) in all but one small Caucasian cohort and in the
                        Arab cohort. Adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least one APOE ε4 allele greatly reduced evidence for
                        association with PICALM but not CR1 or CLU. Models with the main SNP effect, APOE ε4 (+/−), and an
                        interaction term showed significant interaction between APOE ε4 (+/−) and PICALM . We confirm in a completely independent dataset that CR1,
                            CLU , and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in
                        European ancestry populations. Genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly
                        in APOE ε4-positive subject. Thus, APOE and PICALM synergistically
                        interact.

## INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia,
                affecting 5% of the population over 65 years and 30–50% over
                80 years. Substantial progress was made identifying genes for rare forms of
                early-onset AD 1 – 4 and this early success significantly contributed to
                biologic study on AD mechanisms and more recently multiple drug discovery
                approaches. Late-onset AD, the common form of the disease, has been more difficult
                to solve with apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) being the only confirmed
                susceptibility locus 5 . The combination of
                high-density genotyping methods, large well-characterized AD and control
                populations, and statistical methods to evaluate population stratification now
                provide the tools to identify additional genes contributing to AD risk.

Recently, two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported evidence that
                variations in CLU (encoding Clusterin), PICALM (encoding the Phosphatidylinositol Binding Clathrin Assembly protein), and CR1 (encoding Complement Component (3b/4b) Receptor 1), confer
                genetic risk for AD 6 – 7 . Evidence for these three loci reached genome wide
                significance in samples consisting of 5,964 cases and 10,188 controls
                    ( PICALM and CLU ) and 5,887 cases and 8,508
                controls ( CRI and CLU ). To analyze the role of
                these genes in AD risk, the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC)
                performed a meta analysis using GWAS data for 15,239 subjects from 9 Northern
                European Whites cohorts and 5 cohorts that included African Americans, Israeli
                Arabs, and Caribbean Hispanics ( Table 1 ).
                Genotypes for CR1 , CLU , and PICALM were analyzed for association with AD using cohorts that
                are completely independent of those originally used to identify these 3 loci as AD
                susceptibility factors. The controls used are all elderly (age > 60 years). We
                also examined the interaction of APOE with CR1 , CLU , and PICALM on AD risk.

## METHODS
All cohorts are described in more detail in the supplementary material provide
                    online. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer’s Disease
                        Center (ADC) subjects were ascertained, evaluated, and sampled by the
                    clinical and neuropathology cores of the 29 NIA-funded ADCs ( Table 1 ). Subject data data collection is
                    coordinated by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). DNA
                    from these samples for genotyping was prepared by the National Cell Repository
                    for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD). The Alzheimer’s Disease
                        Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects are AD cases and controls
                    ascertained for neuroimaging, biomarker, and genetic studies. Data used here
                    were generates as previously described 8 and obtained from the ADNI database ( www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI ). The Collaborative Aging and Memory Project (CAMP) subjects are from
                    the Amish communities of central Ohio and northern Indiana 9 – 10 .
                    The Columbia University (CU) subjects are a Hispanic cohort
                    described in detail elsewhere 11 . The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a single-site, community-based,
                    ongoing cohort study described elsewhere 12 – 14 . Phenotype and
                    genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were from dbGaP website ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap ). The Johns Hopkins
                        University (JHU) subjects are from the Gen etic
                    and En vironmental R isk Factors for A lzheimer’s disease among A frican Americans (GenerAAtions) Study identified
                    through the electronic claims database of the Henry Ford Health System. The MIRAGE Study is a family-based genetic epidemiological study of
                    AD in which AD cases and unaffected sibling controls were enrolled at 17
                    clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Greece 15 . The NIA-LOAD Family
                        Study 16 cohort are families
                    with two or more affected siblings with LOAD and unrelated, non-demented control
                    subjects similar in age and ethnic background. One case per family was selected
                    and controls were deteremined to be cognitively normal after an in-person
                    neurological examination and were not related to a study participant. The Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) were recruited from
                    aging research cohorts at 10 NIA-funded ADCs and do not overlap with other ADGC
                    samples. The TGEN dataset is a publicly available sample of AD
                    cases and controls ( http://www.tgen.org/research/index.cfm?pageid=1065 17 . The University of
                        Miami/Vanderbilt University/Mt. Sinai School of Medicine (UM/VU/MSSM) were new and previously published 18 – 22 subjects
                    ascertained at the University of Miami, Vanderbilt University and Mt. Sinai
                    School of Medicine. The Wadi Ara dataset are from an inbred Arab
                    community in northern Israel 23 – 26 .

The cohorts used were genotyped either on Illumina or Affymetrix SNP
                    arrays ( Table 2 ). We selected 17 SNPs
                    from CR1 , CLU , and PICALM that were recently reported to be significantly associated with AD in two large
                    GWA studies 6 – 7 ( Table 3 ).
                    Additional genotypes were obtained using an Applied Biosystems’ (ABI)
                    TaqMan Assays including genotypes for rs7982. Genotyping for the APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles was performed
                    as described in the supplementary material provided online.

The analysis included only individuals with a censoring age of 60 years
                    or older. The age used for cases was that most closely approximating the age of
                    disease onset. For some cohorts, age-at-onset was ascertained while for others,
                    only age-at-ascertainment was available. For some autopsied subjects, only
                    age-at-death was available and was used as the censoring age. For all studies,
                    the age used for controls was the age of last exam or death. (see also supplementary material provided online).

We imputed genotypes for all SNPs within 10Kb of the three genes
                        using the Markov Chain haplotyping (MaCH) software 27 to obtain a common set of SNPs across all
                        datasets. We imputed SNPs from both HapMap releases II and III and retained
                        those with pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD; r 2 > 0.50) for further analysis (see also
                        the supplementary
                            material online for more detail and for data cleaning
                        protocols).

To determine if population substructure existed in the different
                        datasets, we used 30,000 – 100,000 SNPs with minor allele frequency
                        (MAF) > 0.25 and minimal between-SNP linkage disequilibrium
                                ( r 2 < 0.20) sampled at random from
                        the autosomes, and analyzed with the STRUCTURE software package 28 – 29 . To account for population substructure in
                        association analyses, EIGENSTRAT 30 was used on each cohort to generate loadings from principal components
                        analysis on the sampled SNPs sampled (see also supplementary material online).

Genotyped and imputed SNPs were tested for association with AD using
                        a logistic generalized linear model (GLM) in case-control datasets and a
                        logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) in family-based datasets.
                        Genotyped SNPs were coded as 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of minor
                        alleles under the additive genetic model, whereas APOE was
                        coded as 0 or 1 according to the presence or absence of the ε4
                        allele. For imputed SNPs, a quantitative estimate between 0 and 2 for the
                        dose of the minor allele were used to incorporate the uncertainty of the
                        imputation estimates. Regression models for each SNP without covariates were
                        evaluated for comparison with results from the original reports 6 – 7 Additional models containing all permutations of covariates
                        for age, gender and APOE ε4 status were also
                        tested. Formal tests of interaction between the SNPs and APOE were assessed by including the main effects and an
                        interaction term. Regression models were evaluated using the R package 31 . Heterogeneity among odds ratios was
                        assessed using Cochran’s Q , which was calculated as
                        the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects and
                        the pooled effect across studies, with the weights being those used in the
                        pooling method. Q is distributed as a χ 2 with k (number of studies)
                        minus 1 degrees of freedom. The I 2 statistic 32 – 33 describes the percentage of
                        variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance and
                        is calculated as follows: I 2 =
                        100% × ( Q −df)/ Q.
                                I 2 is an intuitive and simple expression of the
                        inconsistency of studies’ results. Unlike Q it does
                        not inherently depend upon the number of studies considered. SNP association
                        results obtained from individual datasets were combined by meta-analysis
                        using the inverse variance method implemented in the software package METAL
                            ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal/index.html ). An
                        additive model was assumed and the association results across datasets were
                        combined by summing the regression coefficients weighted by the inverse
                        variance of the coefficients. The meta-analysis P-value of the association
                        was estimated by the summarized test statistic.

## RESULTS
To analyze the role CR1, CLU, and PICALM in AD risk, the ADGC performed a
                meta-analysis using phenotypes and GWAS data from 12 different cohorts ( Table 1 ). The ADGC is a collaborative network
                in the United States that includes the 29 NIA-funded ADCs and numerous AD genetics
                investigators who are working to identify genes responsible for AD. Of 7,070 AD
                cases examined, 3,055 of had autopsy documentation of AD. Of the 8,169 cognitively
                normal elderly subjects (age >60) examined, 1,155 had autopsies documenting
                absence of significant AD neuropathology. The cohorts used included unrelated
                Caucasian cases and controls from the following sources: the NIA-funded ADCs,
                    ADNI 8 , 34 , UM/VU/MSSM 18 – 21 , TGEN 17 , and OHSU 35 . Caucasian cases
                and controls from the following family-based studies were also included: the MIRAGE
                    Study 15 , FHS 13 – 14 , 36 , NIA-LOAD, and CAMP 9 – 10 .
                Populations not of Caucasian descent included African American subjects from several
                ADCs, a community-based (Detroit) study of AD, and the MIRAGE study 15 ; Caribbean Hispanics from Manhattan, the Dominican
                Republic, and Puerto Rico; and members of a genetically isolated Arab community in
                Wadi Ara, Israel 23 – 26 .

In each dataset, we evaluated association of AD with SNPs in or near CR1 , CLU , and PICALM that
                were genotyped on various platforms or imputed ( Table 2 ). Results were combined across datasets using a meta-analysis
                approach ( Table 3 ). We analyzed each
                racial/ethnic group separately. In Caucasians, the largest group (n = 5,935
                cases, 7,034 controls), we found significant evidence of association with multiple
                SNPs at each locus. In the unadjusted analyses, we obtained an odds ratio (OR) of
                0.91 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.85 – 0.96) for CLU SNP rs11136000, which is comparable to the effect-size
                reported previously for the same SNP (ORs = 0.86 7 and 0.91 6 ). For
                the CR1 SNP rs3818361, we obtained an OR of 1.14 (CI = 1.07
                – 1.22) compared to the previous report of 1.19 7 . PICALM SNP rs3851179 had an OR of
                0.89 (CI = 0.84 – 0.94) compared to 0.86 observed previously 6 . None of the SNPs were significantly
                associated with AD in any of the other ethnic groups analyzed together or
                separately, possibly due to small sizes of these groups (1,135 cases and 1,135
                controls, Supplementary eTable
                    1 ).

We also examined the influence of APOE on the associations
                of the three genes with AD, since APOE is a known AD susceptibility
                locus in most ethnic groups 5 , 37 and several APOE genotypes have been
                reported to modify disease expression in persons with rare mutations in presenilin 1
                    ( PSEN1) 38 , presenilin 2
                    ( PSEN2) 39 , and the
                amyloid precursor protein ( APP) 39 – 40 genes. For the 13
                cohorts where APOE genotype data were available, presence of one or
                more APOE ε4 alleles was significantly associated with AD
                (ORs ranging from 1.80 to 9.05) in all groups except the Amish and Israeli-Arabs
                    ( Table 4 ). We next re-evaluated the
                association of AD with the CR1, CLU and PICALM SNPs in the Caucasian cohorts adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least
                one APOE ε4 allele and found greatly reduced evidence for
                association with PICALM after adjustment ( Table 3 , Supplementary eTable 2 ), an effect that
                is attributable primarily to APOE ( eTable 2 ). To explore this effect
                further, we analyzed the association of CR1 , CLU ,
                and PICALM SNPs with AD in subgroups stratified by the presence
                (+) or absence (−) of the APOE ε4 allele.
                This analysis revealed that the association with CLU is evident
                only among ε4 (−) subjects, whereas the association with PICALM is evident only among ε4 (+) subjects
                    ( Table 5 ). Analysis of models containing
                terms for the main effects of each SNP and APOE ε4
                (+/−), and an interaction term showed significant evidence of
                interaction for APOE ε4 (+/−) and seven of
                the nine PICALM SNPs with indications of a synergistic effect of
                these two genes on AD risk ( Table 5 and Supplementary eTable 3 ).
                Interactions of CR1 and CLU SNPs with APOE ε4 (+/−) were not statistically
                significant.

## COMMENTS
Using a large multi-center dataset of AD cases and controls, we confirm that CR1, CLU and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci
                in European ancestry populations. The ORs we get for each is similar to those
                obtained in the original discovery cohort, suggesting that these estimates of risk
                are quite accurate for the Caucasian AD population, reflecting in part the large
                size of the cohorts used 6 – 7 . Clearly a large dataset is required to
                replicate these small-effect loci. We were unable to replicate the association of
                these 3 genes in the African-American, Arab, and Hispanic populations. However,
                further analysis is merited in these racial/ethnic groups using larger cohorts.

While this manuscript was being prepared for publication, a GWAS on AD was
                reported by Seshadri et al . 41 . There was some overlap in that study and ours in that the TGEN and
                Framingham cohorts are used in both studies. However, whereas Seshadri et
                    al. used only prospectively diagnosed AD cases (n=52) and
                unrelated controls (n=2,091) from the Framingham Study, we included these
                subjects as well as prevalent and newly diagnosed cases and related controls
                yielding a total sample of 197 AD cases and 2,392 controls. Both studies
                independently confirm that CLU and PICALM are AD
                susceptibility genes. A primary difference between the 2 studies is that here we
                confirm CR1 as an AD locus while Seshadri et
                    al. 41 obtained only nominal
                support for CR1 .

The cohorts used here have several features worth mentioning in the context
                of GWAS for AD. First, the cohorts have a large number of autopsies in the cases
                (3,055). Because the gold standard for diagnosis is neuropathologic confirmation of
                AD pathology, using autopsied cases reduces etiologic heterogeneity. Second, the
                controls used here were elderly, of comparable age to case onset ages, and were
                cognitively normal. Since these subjects lived to a comparable age to cases without
                developing AD, the case-control contrast should be more robust than if young
                controls are used. In addition, cases and controls will be comparably censored at
                other non-AD loci responsible for common diseases of the elderly that are unrelated
                to AD. Third, the cohorts used here were not involved in the initial discovery of CLU , CR1 and PICALM and thus
                represent a completely independent replication dataset. This is critical in terms of
                evaluating evidence that these genes are truly AD risk loci. The ideal controls for
                an AD GWAS would be subjects who were cognitively normal at death, had autopsy
                documentation that plaque load and tangle distribution did not reach criteria for AD
                pathology, and who were elderly. In autopsy series of older cognitively normal
                subjects, most have some NFTs and some non-neuritic, and possibly spare neuritic
                amyloid deposits, but do not reach the accepted threshold for AD, although about a
                third of these normal subjects do meet neuropathologic criteria for AD 42 – 45 . In autopsy series of MCI subjects, up to two thirds of subjects have
                AD-level neuropathology 46 . These findings
                give rise to the hypothesis that amyloid deposition and tangle formation begin
                before cognitive decline becomes detectable, an idea strengthened by recent
                biomarker and amyloid imaging work 47 . Thus in
                persons without dementia, a fraction, mostly those with MCI, will develop AD within
                a few years and this conversion rate increases with the age of the population,
                decreasing the contrast between cases and controls and reducing power. To minimize
                the potential confounding effect of MCI, we excluded them from these analyses and
                emphasized 1,155 controls with autopsy information ( Table 1 ).

When we examined the interaction CR1, CLU and PICALM, and APOE genotypes, we detected
                synergy between APOE and PICALM but not with CR1 or CLU. Our results show that the PICALM association is predominantly in subjects carrying the
                APOE ε4 allele. Consistent with conclusions from previous studies showing
                interaction of APOE with PSEN1 38 , PSEN2 39 , and APP 39 – 40 , our results
                suggest that the APOE and PICALM gene products
                participate in a common pathogenic pathway leading to AD. Since PSEN1 , PSEN2 , and APP are all
                involved in Aβ production, PICALM may also participate in
                this process though a more indirect involvement cannot be ruled out and the biology
                of these interactions remains to be detemined. We did not detect an interaction of APOE with CR1 or CLU, though this could be due to sample size,
                which was not large enough to detect very weak interactions. Also, since the APOE effect on AD risk is much stronger in young case
                    populations 37 , the age structure of our
                study and of others may not be optimal for detecting these interactions.

Our study and those from other consortia 6 , 7 , 56 show that AD
                susceptibility loci can be identified by GWAS. Initial AD GWAS had samples sizes
                that, in comparison to those from the large consortia, were modest and inadequately
                powered to detect the small effect loci replicated here 19 , 48 – 53 . As sample sizes
                increase, as in other complex disorders, we expect additional loci to be
                identified.
