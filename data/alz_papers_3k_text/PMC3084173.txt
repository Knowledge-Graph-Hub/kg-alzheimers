Common variants in ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are associated with Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC). First, we undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (Stage 1) and identified 10 novel variants with P ≤1×10 −5 . These were tested for association in an independent sample (Stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (Stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provide compelling evidence that ABCA7 (meta- P 4.5×10 −17 ; including ADGC meta- P =5.0×10 −21 ) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta- P =1.8×10 −14 ; including ADGC meta- P =1.2×10 −16 ; rs670139, meta- P =1.4×10 −9 ; including ADGC meta- P =1.1×10 −10 ) are novel susceptibility loci for AD. Second, we observed independent evidence for association for three suggestive loci reported by the ADGC GWAS, which when combined shows genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+ P =8.0×10 −4 ; including ADGC meta- P =8.6×10 −9 ), CD33 (GERAD+ P=2.2×10 −4 ; including ADGC meta- P =1.6×10 −9 ) and EPHA1 (GERAD+ P=3.4×10 −4 ; including ADGC meta- P =6.0×10 −10 ). These findings support five novel susceptibility genes for AD.
