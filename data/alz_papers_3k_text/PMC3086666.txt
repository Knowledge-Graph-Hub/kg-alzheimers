# Title
Meta-analysis of the Association Between Variants inSORL1and Alzheimer Disease

# Abstract
To reexamine the association between the neuronal sortilin-related receptor gene ( SORL1 ) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Comprehensive and unbiased meta-analysis of all published and unpublished data from case-control studies for the SORL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that had been repeatedly assessed across studies. Academic research institutions in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, Sweden, Germany, France, and Italy. All published white and Asian case-control data sets, which included a total of 12 464 cases and 17 929 controls. Alzheimer disease according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer’s Association). In the white data sets, several markers were associated with AD after correction for multiple testing, including previously reported SNPs 8, 9, and 10 ( P <.001). In addition, the C-G-C haplotype at SNPs 8 through 10 was associated with AD risk ( P <.001). In the combined Asian data sets, SNPs 19 and 23 through 25 were associated with AD risk ( P <.001). The disease-associated alleles at SNPs 8, 9, and 10 (120 873 131-120 886 175 base pairs [bp]; C-G-C alleles), at SNP 19 (120 953 300 bp; G allele), and at SNPs 24 through 25 (120 988 611 bp; T and C alleles) were the same previously reported alleles. The SNPs 4 through 5, 8 through 10, 12, and 19 through 25 belong to distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks. The same alleles at SNPs 8 through 10 (C-G-C), 19 (G), and 24 and 25 (T and C) have also been associated with AD endophenotypes, including white matter hyperintensities and hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid β-peptide 42, and full-length SORL1 expression in the human brain. This comprehensive meta-analysis provides confirmatory evidence that multiple SORL1 variants in distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks are associated with AD.

## METHODS
The primary sources of the studies addressing the risk for AD associated with the SORL1 gene polymorphisms were the AlzGene database (updated September 1, 2009) and the PubMed database. The keywords used for searching PubMed were SORL1 , SORLA , LR11 , Alzheimer disease, and Alzheimer’s disease . The retrieved abstracts were read to identify studies examining the genotype association between SNPs within the SORL1 gene and AD. We also performed a manual search of references cited in published articles. The studies were read in their entirety to assess their appropriateness for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Criteria for the inclusion in the analysis were diagnosis of AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer Diseases and Related Disorders Association Working Group criteria 26 ; genotyping data for SORL1 SNPs 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, and 22 through 25; case-control study design; and control population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We did not include studies that imputed SNP data. This led to inclusion of all published white * (n=14) and Asian (n=3) data sets. 15 , 18 , 23 In addition to the published studies, 1 white study 28 was included in which the authors had obtained the SNP genotypes but had not published those specific results. Autopsy confirmation was available in 1 study. 2 One Israeli Arab, 6 1 Caribbean Hispanic, 6 and 1 African American 3 case-control study were eliminated because of lack of additional case-control data sets in these ethnic groups.

Genotyping methods for each data set are described in the original publications. 1 – 3 , 5 , 6 , 15 – 18 , 23 We performed separate meta-analyses of the white and Asian data sets. To determine the strength of associations between the individual SORL1 SNPs and AD, we calculated a pooled odds ratio (OR) for each marker using fixed- and random-effects models as implemented in PLINK. We first performed meta-analyses of unadjusted results from the individual data sets and then repeated the meta-analyses using the results from the individual data sets adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype. The P values for each SNP were corrected for multiple testing (ie, analysis of 11 SNPs) using the false discovery rate. 29 Between–data set heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 metric for inconsistency, 30 and its statistical significance was tested with the χ 2 distributed Q statistic. 31 I 2 is determined by the formula (Q − df )/Q, where df is the number of degrees of freedom (1 less than the number of combined data sets); it is considered large for values above 50%, and Q is considered statistically significant for P =.10. 30 , 31 Possible publication bias was assessed by constructing individual funnel plots for most consistently significant SNPs (8, 9, and 10). 32 These SNPs were chosen because they had a high genotyping frequency and homogeneity across data sets and constitute the risk haplotype C-G-C identified in the present meta-analysis and the initial study. 6 Finally, we performed haplotype analyses of the individual data sets with a sliding window of 3 contiguous SNPs using PLINK and subsequently performed meta-analyses of these results.

## RESULTS
The combined data sets of all available white studies included a total of 11 592 cases and 17 048 controls, and the combined data sets of all available Asian studies comprised 872 cases and 881 controls. The main characteristics of the individual data sets are given in Table 2 .

Table 3 gives the results of the meta-analyses for the combined white and Asian studies. Because there was no evidence for between–data set heterogeneity of fixed-effects estimates and the random-effects estimates across data sets were similar, we adopted the pooled estimate derived by the fixed-effects model for SNPs showing no heterogeneity and adopted the OR derived by the random-effects model for SNPs showing heterogeneity. Notably, in the meta-analysis of all published white data sets (n=11 592 cases and 17 048 controls), 7 of the 11 assessed markers (ie, SNPs 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 19) were significantly associated with AD after correction for multiple testing ( Table 3 ). Importantly, the most significant associations were the C-G-C alleles at SNPs 8, 9, and 10 ( P <.001) and the G allele at SNP 19 that were shown to be associated with AD in the initial report. 6 Of note, SNPs 4, 5, 8 through 10, 12, and 19 through 25 belong to distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, with a low D′ between the blocks (eFigure 1; http://www.archneurol.com ).

A meta-analysis of haplotypes at SNPs 8, 9, and 10 further confirmed C-G-C as a risk haplotype (OR, 1.2; P <.001; haplotype frequency, 0.56). Incomplete genotyping of SNPs 22 through 25 across the individual studies in combination with low haplotype frequencies of the putative risk haplotypes C-T-T and T-T-C at SNPs 22, 23, and 24 and 23, 24, and 25, respectively, did not allow us to perform meta-analyses of these putative risk haplotypes. Adjustment for age, sex, and APOE in each data set did not change these meta-analysis results. When the data sets of the initial report were excluded from the analysis (Canadian and Mayo Clinic data sets), the results for SNPs 8, 9, 10, and 12 remained essentially unchanged ( Table 4 ). The eTable gives the allelic association test results for SNPs 8 through 10 in the individual white data sets.

In the combined Asian data sets containing all available Asian data (n=872 cases and 881 controls), several SNPs in the 3′ end (SNPs 19 and 23–25), which lie within 1 LD block (eFigure 2), were associated with AD ( Table 5 ). Among these, the strongest ORs and P values were observed for SNPs 19 ( P =.001), 23 ( P <. 001), and 24 ( P <.001). Of note, consistent with the meta-analyses of the white data set and the original report, the disease-associated alleles included the G allele at SNP 19 and the T and C alleles at SNPs 24 and 25. There was no association of SNPs 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, or 12 with AD in the combined Asian data sets. Also, these meta-analysis results remained unchanged after adjustment for age, sex, and APOE in each data set. Funnel plots of SNPs 8, 9, and 10 did not show evidence of publication bias ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ).

## COMMENT
We obtained all available white and Asian data on the SORL1 -AD association, which allowed us to perform unbiased, comprehensive meta-analyses of data of 30 393 individuals (12 464 cases and 17 929 controls). Our findings confirm that variants in SORL1 are associated with risk for AD in white and Asian populations and that there are likely to be multiple causative genetic variants in distinct regions in SORL1 . Although in the combined white data sets, markers in multiple regions of the gene were associated with AD risk, in the Asian data sets, markers in the 3′ end were predominantly related to AD risk. Importantly, the variants associated with AD in the combined white data sets occur in several distinct LD blocks. These observations suggest that the negative findings of previously published, individually analyzed data sets were likely related to underpowered studies with small sample sizes, allelic or locus heterogeneity, or both. It is also likely that many of the complex genetic factors for late-onset AD, such as SORL1 and other loci identified in large genome-wide association studies (eg, CLU, CR1, or PICALM ), 33 , 34 play only a modest role and are observable only in very large sample sizes or meta-analyses of several data sets.

Of note, the disease-associated alleles in the white and Asian data sets (including the C-G-C alleles at SNPs 8, 9, and 10, the G allele at SNP 19, and the T and C alleles at SNPs 24 and 25) were identical to those observed in the initial report 6 and replicated by 11 subsequent studies. 1 – 3 , 7 , 13 – 19 In addition, haplotype meta-analyses in the combined white data sets confirmed the finding in the initial report 6 that the C-G-C haplotype at SNPs 8, 9, and 10 is associated with increased risk of AD. There is only 1 published case-control study of the SORL1 -AD association in African Americans, Caribbean Hispanics, and Israeli Arabs, to our knowledge. Thus, we could not perform separate meta-analyses for these ethnic groups. However, as described in this study, the C-G-C haplotype at SNPs 8 through 10 was also associated with AD risk in both the 228 Caribbean Hispanic families 6 and in the 111 cases and 144 controls from a community-based sample of Israeli Arabs. 6 In addition, SNPs 22 through 25, including the T and C alleles at SNPs 24 and 25, were associated with AD in 238 African American sibships 6 and an independent African American case-control data set (n=280). 3

There is biological evidence suggesting that variants in SORL1 , including the T allele at SNP 4, the C-G-C alleles at SNPs 8 through 10, the G allele at SNP 19, and the T and C alleles at SNPs 24 and 25 influence other AD endophenotypes. The SNPs in SORL1 were found to be associated with magnetic resonance imaging endophenotypes of AD (general cerebralatrophy, hippocampalatrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and cerebrovascular disease) in 44 African American and 182 white sibships from the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer’s Genetic Epidemiology and with analogous pathological traits in 69 autopsy-confirmed white AD patients. 35 In the white sibships and autopsy sample, the C-G-C haplotype at SNPs 8 through 10 was associated with white-matter disease, and the T and C alleles at SNPs 24 and 25 were associated with hippocampal atrophy. In a study that explored SORL1 expression in 29 AD vs 28 non-AD brains, 36 the expression of FL-SORL1 but not δ -2-SORL1 was associated with AD, neuropathologic AD, and synaptophysin expression. Consistent with the present meta-analysis, SORL1 expression was also associated with the T allele at SORL1 SNP 4. The SNPs 19, 21, 23, and 25 in SORL1 were also associated with cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ 42 in 153 white AD patients ( P =.003) 37 and age at onset of AD in 349 white AD patients (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.09; P =.007). 17 Finally, in the study by Seshadri et al, 14 SORL1 SNP 29 was significantly associated with abstract reasoning ability as measured by the similarity test ( P <.001) in 705 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham Study participants, indicating an association between SORL1 and cognitive function.

Taken together, these meta-analyses provide confirmatory evidence that multiple SORL1 alleles in distinct LD blocks are associated with AD risk. However, SORL1 may account for only a modest degree of the genetic variance of AD, similar to that of CR1 , CLU, or PICALM . 33 , 34 Moreover, the ability to demonstrate association between SORL1 and AD may be even more difficult than these other genes, given the intralocus heterogeneity.
