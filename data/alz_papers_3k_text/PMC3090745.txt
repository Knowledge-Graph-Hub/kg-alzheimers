Common variants inMS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2uAP, CD33, andEPHA1are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) using a 3 stage design consisting of a discovery stage (Stage 1) and two replication stages (Stages 2 and 3). Both joint and meta -analysis analysis approaches were used. We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A [rs4938933; Stages 1+2, meta -analysis ( P M ) = 1.7 × 10 −9 , joint analysis ( P J ) = 1.7 × 10 −9; Stages 1–3, P M = 8.2 × 10 −12 ], CD2AP (rs9349407; Stages 1–3, P M = 8.6 × 10 −9 ), EPHA1 (rs11767557; Stages 1–3 P M = 6.0 × 10 −10 ), and CD33 (rs3865444; Stages 1–3, P M = 1.6 × 10 −9 ). We confirmed that CR1 (rs6701713; P M = 4.6×10 −10 , P J = 5.2×10 −11 ), CLU (rs1532278; P M = 8.3 × 10 −8 , P J = 1.9×10 −8 ), BIN1 (rs7561528; P M = 4.0×10 −14 ; P J = 5.2×10 −14 ), and PICALM (rs561655; P M = 7.0 × 10 −11 , P J = 1.0×10 −10 ) but not EXOC3L2 are LOAD risk loci 1 – 3 .
