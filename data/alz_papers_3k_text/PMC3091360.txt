# Title
Caspase activation precedes and leads to tangles

# Abstract
Studies of post-mortem tissue have shown that the location of fibrillar tau deposits, called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), matches closely with regions of massive neuronal death 1 , 2 , severe cytological abnormalities 3 , and markers of caspase activation and apoptosis 4 – 6 , leading to the idea that tangles cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and tau-related frontotemporal dementia. However, using in vivo multiphoton imaging to observe tangles and activation of executioner caspases in living tau transgenic mice (Tg4510 strain), we find the opposite: caspase activation occurs first, and precedes tangle formation by hours to days. New tangles form within a day. After a new tangle forms, the neuron remains alive and caspase activity seems to be suppressed. Similarly, introduction of wild-type 4-repeat tau (Tau-4R) into wild-type animals triggered caspase activation, tau truncation and tau aggregation. Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of a construct mimicking caspase-cleaved tau into wild-type mice led to the appearance of intracellular aggregates, tangle-related conformational- and phospho-epitopes, and the recruitment of full-length endogenous tau to the aggregates. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model in which caspase activation cleaves tau to initiate tangle formation, then truncated tau recruits normal tau to misfold and form tangles. Because tangle-bearing neurons are long-lived, we suggest that tangles are ‘off pathway’ to acute neuronal death. Soluble tau species, rather than fibrillar tau, may be the critical toxic moiety underlying neurodegeneration.

## METHODS SUMMARY
We used 7–9-months-old transgenic Tg4510 mice overexpressing human four-repeat tau gene containing the frontotemporal dementia-associated P301L mutation that can be suppressed with doxycycline 7 . By 7 months of age, Tg4510 mice have developed a large number of tangles in the cortex.

Tg4510 mice and littermate controls were anaesthetized with isoflurane, a craniotomy was performed, and thioflavin S and caspase indicators (FLICA – fluorescent inhibitor of caspase reagent, Invitrogen) applied topically before sealing the craniotomy with a coverslip. In vivo multiphoton microscopy was used to image living neurons, existing tangles, activated caspases and formation of new tangles 9 , 10 .

Intracranial injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV2) encoding human tau-4R was performed on two non-transgenic animals at 13 months of age, and left for 6 months. Similarly, an AAV2 encoding human tau truncated at aspartate 421 was performed on three non-transgenic animals at 13 months of age, and left for 10 weeks. Post-mortem studies were carried out by immunohistochemistry on fixed frozen sections.

All animal experiments were carried out under national (United States National Institutes of Health) and institutional guidelines (Massachusetts General Hospital subcommittee for research animal care).

## METHODS
To express tau in rTg4510 mice 7 , the human tau gene (also known as MAPT ) with the P301L mutation, placed downstream of a tetracycline-operon responsive element is co-expressed with an activator transgene consisting of the tet -off open reading frame 28 , which is downstream of Ca 2+ -calmodulin kinase II promoter elements, resulting in P301L expression restricted to forebrain structures 29 . Tg4510 littermate mice, lacking the activator transgene, served as controls.

Cranial window surgery was done under isoflurane anaesthesia (0.5–2%, Baxter) in balanced oxygen. A 6 mm diameter-wide craniotomy was performed on the top of the skull and dura was resected from the exposed cortical surface. A solution containing fluorescent markers (described for individual experiments later) was applied for 20 min. A glass window was then sealed on top of the craniotomy, as described previously 30 .

The animal’s temperature was monitored through a flexible rectal temperature-sensing probe with Homeothermic Blanket Control Unit (Harvard Apparatus). The animal’s temperature is continuously displayed on a front panel LCD display. Temperature was maintained as close as possible to 37 °C with heating stereotaxic frame and blanket.

A sterile PBS solution containing thioflavin S (0.025%, Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (1 mM, Invitrogen) was applied on the surface of the brain. On the day following surgery, images from randomly selected fields throughout the window area were taken at 800 nm excitation to detect thioflavin S aggregates. Images of the same sites were taken at 750 nm excitation to detect Hoechst-positive nuclei. As an alternative to thioflavin S, 300μl of a PBS solution containing X-34 (0.03%, gift from W. E. Klunk) was injected in the tail vein, 2 h before imaging. X-34 aggregates were detected at 800 nm.

A sterile PBS solution containing thioflavin S (0.025%, Sigma) and a red fluorescent indicator of caspase activation (FLICA indicators, 5× concentration, pan-caspase, caspase 6 or caspase 3/7 indicator, Invitrogen) was applied on the surface of the brain. The exposed brain area was randomly imaged on the day of the surgery at 800 nm excitation where both fluorophores were detected.

The same solution described above with thioflavin S and red fluorescent caspase indicator was applied, a removable window was temporarily sealed for the first imaging session where caspase-positive and NFT-negative neurons were recorded throughout the entire imaging volume. After the imaging session, the coverslip was removed, a second dose of thioflavin S (0.025%) was applied to the brain, and a new coverslip was permanently sealed. Observations of the same neurons on the following day were possible using xy coordinates recorded for each high resolution (5×) image of cells of interest; lower resolution (1×) images of the surface of the brain were captured and used as reference to identify the same site based on blood vessels map; 2× images of the same focal plans provided an overview of the area with neighbouring cells.

Doxycycline administration in the chow (Harlan Tekland) was used to suppress the tau transgene for 2–6 weeks. Control mice were also treated with doxycycline.

In vivo imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad 1024ES multiphoton microscope (Bio-Rad Laboratories) (Ti:Sapphire laser: Maitai, Spectra-Physics) as described previously. For quantification of cell death markers, images were taken from randomly selected fields throughout the imaging volume. z -stacks of images were collected in 0.5–2μm steps with resolutions ranging from 0.1μm per pixel to 0.4μm per pixel. Images presented are two-dimensional projections of z -stacks.

Images were taken as z -stacks. All images were processed with ImageJ, and presented as z -projections. Intensity, contrast and colour balances were used to pseudo-colour the images and enhance quality for some images.

Two non-transgenic animals were injected at 13 months of age with an AAV2 encoding human wild-type tau-4R, and three non-transgenic animals were injected at 13 months of age with an AAV2 encoding human tau truncated at aspartate 421, mimicking caspase cleavage at this site. Vectors were constructed in-house and packaged by the Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative.

After completion of the last imaging experiment, or 10 weeks after tau-D421 virus infection (at 15 months old), or 6 months after tau-4R virus infection (18 months old), animals were euthanized with CO 2 , brains dissected into 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) + 15% glycerol, and post-fixed for 48 h. Sections (40μm) were cut on a freezing microtome (Leica Microsystems) and standard immunofluorescence techniques were used to label tau-D421 (cleaved at Asp421; mouse monoclonal antibody TauC3, Invitrogen), C-terminal tau (beyond the 421 truncation site; rabbit polyclonal antibody Ab-3, Thermo Scientific), the conformation-specific Alz50 epitope (mouse monoclonal IgM antibody Alz50, courtesy P. Davies), the hyperphosphorylated tau-specific AT8 epitope (mouse monoclonal antibody human PHF-tau, clone AT8, Thermo Scientific) and PHF1 epitope (mouse monoclonal antibody, courtesy P. Davies).

To determine the level of overexpression associated with pathological changes in AAV injected animals, sections from one AAV-injected animal were co-stained with pan-tau antibody Tg-5 (which labels both human and mouse tau; mouse monoclonal antibody, courtesy Peter Davies) and Alz50. Image stacks were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal system with collection parameters identical for all images. The intensity of Tg-5 immunostaining was measured in z -projections in ImageJ (NIH) for cells with Alz-50 staining ( n = 19) and cells far from the injection site that had no tau-D421 expression ( n = 20). The mean intensity of Alz50 positive neurons divided by the mean intensity of non-infected neurons was calculated to estimate the fold overexpression of truncated tau in neurons with pathological changes; this analysis indicates that virally mediated transduction led to a 2.7-fold overexpression of tau in Alz50-positive neurons.

Images for figures were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal/2-photon system mounted on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss) for fluorescent staining ( Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Fig. 5d–f ), and on an upright Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America) for fluorescent staining ( Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Fig. 5a–c ).
