Induction of human neuronal cells by defined transcription factors

# Abstract
Somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, or expression of lineage-specific factors have been shown to induce cell-fate changes in diverse somatic cell types 1 – 12 . We recently observed that forced expression of a combination of three transcription factors, Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2) , Ascl1 , and Myt1l can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal (iN) cells 13 . Here, we show that the same three factors can generate functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells as early as 6 days after transgene activation. When combined with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1 , these factors could also convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into iN cells displaying typical neuronal morphologies and expressing multiple neuronal markers, even after downregulation of the exogenous transcription factors. Importantly, the vast majority of human iN cells were able to generate action potentials and many matured to receive synaptic contacts when co-cultured with primary mouse cortical neurons. Our data demonstrate that non-neural human somatic cells, as well as pluripotent stem cells, can be directly converted into neurons by lineage-determining transcription factors. These methods may facilitate robust generation of patient-specific human neurons for in vitro disease modeling or future applications in regenerative medicine.

## Methods
H9 human ES cells (WiCell Research Resources) were expanded in mTeSR1 (Stem Cell Technologies). The generation and characterization of the iPS cells used in this study will be published elsewhere (Sebastiano & Wernig). The day before infection, cells were treated with accutase and seeded as single cells in 3.5 cm tissue culture dishes on matrigel in mTeSR1 containing 2 µM Thiazovivin (Bio Vision) 24 . To inhibit the growth of uninfected ES cells and select for post-mitotic neurons, we added 4 µM Cytosine β- d -arabinofuranoside ( Ara-C) to the media 48 hours after dox addition. Primary human fetal fibroblasts were isolated from the distal half of the limbs of 8–10 week old fetuses (Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.). The tissue was dissociated after trypsin digestion and plated in MEF media (DMEM high glucose, calf serum, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin and β-mercaptoethanol). Primary human postnatal fibroblasts (HPFs) were established from dissociated foreskin tissue derived from 1–3 day-old newborns. Before being used for experiments, primary fibroblast cells were passaged for at least 3 times. Primary mouse cortical cultures and glial monolayer cultures were established as previously described 13 . To maintain the iN cell culture, cells were either cultured in N3 media media (DMEM/F2 (Invitrogen), apotransferrin (100 µg/ml), insulin (5 µg/ml), sodium selenite (30 nM), progesterone (20 nM), putrescine (100 nM), penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with neurotrophic factors including brain derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 and ciliary neurotrophic factor (R&D systems) or dissociated using papain and replated onto previously established monolayer culture of primary mouse glia or primary neurons from mouse cortex in neuronal growth media (MEM (Gibco) supplemented with B27 (Gibco), glucose (5mg/ml), transferring (10 µg/ml), 5% fetal bovine serum and Ara-C (2µM, Sigma) 13 , 25 .

Lentiviral production and fibroblast infections were performed as described previously 13 . Briefly, primary human fetal or postnatal fibroblasts were plated and infected with concentrated lentiviral particles and polybrene (8 µg/µL) in fresh MEF media. Viral media was removed after 16–24 hours and replaced with MEF media containing doxycycline (dox, 2 µg/µL). After 24–48 hours, media was changed to N3 media containing dox (2µg/µL). For human ES cell infections, H9 human embryonic stem cells were switched into N3 media containing polybrene (2 µg/µL) 24 hours after re-plating, and concentrated lentiviral particles were added. After 16–24 hours, cultures were switched into N3 media containing dox (2 µg/µL) and changed daily before dissociation. Forty-eight hours after the initial addition of dox, Ara-C (4 µg/µL) was added to the media to inhibit proliferation of uninfected ES cells until analysis 6 days after the addition of dox. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich™ if not otherwise specified.

Single-cell gene expression profiling was performed utilizing the Fluidigm Biomark dynamic array according to the manufacturer’s protocol 18 , 26 . Briefly, single cells growing on culture dishes after 5 or 6 weeks of transduction were collected by aspiration into patch electrodes and ejected into 2× cells direct buffer (Invitrogen), flash frozen and kept at −80°C until further processing. Thawed cells were subject to target-specific reverse-transcription and 18 cycles of PCR pre-amplification with a mix of primers specific to the target genes (STA). STA products were then processed for real-time PCR analysis on Biomark 48:48 Dynamic Array integrated fluidic circuits (Fluidigm). To ensure the specificity of the amplification, titrations of total human brain RNA were included in each experiment, and only primers that demonstrated a linear amplification were analyzed. Furthermore, melting curves of the PCR products were compared between the single cells and the control RNA to ensure the specificity of the PCR products.

Action potentials were recorded with current-clamp whole-cell configuration. The pipette solution for current-clamp experiments contained (in mM): 123 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl 2 , 1 K 2 ATP, 0.2 Na 4 GTP and 4 glucose, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Membrane potentials were kept around −65 to −70 mV, and step currents were injected to elicit action potentials. For whole-cell voltage dependent current recordings, the same internal solution as aforementioned was used. For synaptic functional evaluation, the internal solution contained (in mM): CsCl 135, HEPES 10, EGTA 1, Mg-ATP 4, Na 4 GTP 0.4, and QX-314 10, pH7.4. The bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl 2 2, MgCl 2 2, HEPES 10, and glucose 10, pH7.4. Synaptic responses were measured as described previously 13 , 25 . Stimulus artifacts for evoked synaptic responses were removed for graphic representation. Electrophysiological data are presented as mean ± SEM. All statistical comparisons were made using Student’s t -test.

For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, cells were blocked in a solution of PBS containing 4% BSA and 1% cosmic calf serum (CCS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied for 1 hour and 30 min, respectively. The following antibodies were used for our analysis: rabbit anti-Tuj1 (Covance, 1:1000), mouse anti-Tuj1 (Covance, 1:1000), mouse anti-MAP2 (Sigma, 1:500), mouse anti-NeuN (Millipore, 1:200), mouse anti-neurofilament (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), 2H3a, 1:1000), rabbit anti-synapsin (E028, 1:1000), anti-synaptotagmin (Synaptic systems, 41.1, 1:2000), guinea pig anti-vGLUT1 (Millipore, 1:2000), mouse anti-GAD6 (DSHB, 1:500), rabbit anti-Tbr1 (Abcam, 1:200), mouse anti-Peripherin (Sigma, 1:100), sheep anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase (Pel-Freez, 1:500), rabbit anti-GFAP (DAKO, 1:4000), mouse anti-Sox2 (R&D Systems, 1:50), goat anti-Brn2 (clone C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), rabbit anti-Ascl1 (Abcam, 1:200), mouse anti-BrdU (Becton-Dickinson, 1:50), mouse anti-LU5 (Abcam, 1:200), goat anti-Sox10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:40). FITC-, and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Alexa-488-, Alexa-546- and Alexa-633-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. DAPI (Sigma, 1:10,000). For RT-PCR analysis, RNA was isolated using RNAqueous® Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions, treated with DNAse (Applied Biosystems) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen).

The following method was used to calculate the efficiency of neuronal induction. The total number of Tuj1 positive cells with a neuronal morphology, defined as cells having a circular, three-dimensional appearance that extend a thin process at least three times longer than their cell body, were quantified at indicated time points. We determined this number in at least 15 randomly selected 20× visual fields on a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope. The average and standard deviation per field was determined and then used to extrapolate the total number of iN cells present in the entire dish based the known surface areas of a 20× visual field and the respective culture dish. We then divided this number by the number of cells plated before infection to get the percentage of the starting population of cells that adopted neuron-like characteristics. In multiple independent experiments we verified that this extrapolation method yields cell numbers very similar to those measured by a hemocytometer at the time of plating. Data are presented as Mean ± SD.
