## Materials and Methods
This study was approved by the local institutional review boards. ALS patients met the diagnosis of probable or definite ALS as defined in the revised EL-Escorial 31 . Patients with dementia met the criteria for FTD or FTLD proposed by Neary et al 32 or Cairns et al 33 . The dementia was similar to FTD on inception and was progressive, and eventually global in most patients. One patient had mild mental retardation before onset of dementia. There were eight patients with both ALS and dementia. Dementia preceded motor symptoms in some patients, but no patient remained free of motor involvement. The FTLD symptoms included abnormalities in both behavior and executive function, although the degree of severity varied depending on the individuals in different stages of the disease. Pedigrees and clinical data were collected by specialists in neuromuscular medicine and were verified by medical records or decent examination to establish diagnosis ( Supplementary Table 2 ). DNA and other samples were taken after obtaining written informed consent. Overall, DNA from over 200 cases with ALS and 928 controls were used for genetic analysis. Spinal cord autopsy samples from two X-linked ALS cases (P497H or P506T each), 41 cases with ALS or ALS dementia and six non-ALS controls were studied. In addition, available autopsy samples from the motor cortex region of a patient with the P497H mutation (F#186, IV-7), brain regions (including hippocampus, cerebellum, optic nerve, visual cortex, pons and midbrain) of two patients with the P506T mutation (F#6316, II-3 and III-4), and the hippocampal region of 10 ALS and five ALS/dementia cases were also used for pathological and immunohistological studies. These five ALS/dementia cases were classified as having frontotemporal lobar degeneration of motor neuron disease type (FTLD-MND/FTLD-U), including four cases with pathological type 3 and one case with pathological type 2 according to the classification system proposed by Mackenzie et al. 34 . These cases were evaluated by a neuropathologist (E.H.B).

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole peripheral blood, transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines or available tissues by standard methods (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Intronic primers flanking exons were designed at least 50 nucleotides away from the intron/exon boundary. When a PCR product was over 500 bp, multiple overlapping primers were designed with an average of 50 bp overlap. Forty nanograms of genomic DNA were used for PCR amplification. The amplification protocol consisted of the following steps: incubation at 95°C for 1 min, 32 cycles of 95°C (30s), 55°C (30s) and 72°C (1 min) and a final 5 min extension at 72°C, with modifications when necessary. Unconsumed dNTPs and primers were digested with Exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (ExoSAP-IT, USB, Santa Clara, CA). When nonspecific PCR amplification occurred, the PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel and the specific PCR product was cut out from the gel and purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). For sequencing of a PCR product, fluorescent dye labeled single-strand DNA was amplified using Beckman Coulter sequencing reagents (GenomeLab DTCS Quick Start Kit) followed by single-pass bidirectional sequencing with a CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). We sequenced the entire protein-coding exons and 30–50 bp intronic sequences flanking the exons. UBQLN2 is an intronless gene. We divided the UBQLN2 gene into five overlapping PCR fragments to carry out sequencing analysis. These five overlapping PCR fragments cover the entire coding sequence (1,872bp), 125bp of the 5′ UTR and 293bp of the 3′UTR.

For fragments 4 and 5, the PCR protocol consisted of the following steps: incubation at 96°C for 2 min, 32 cycles of 96°C (30s), 56°C (30s) and 72°C (1min) and a final 5 min extension at 72°C. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) before sequencing.

Two anti-ubiquilin2 antibodies were used. One was a mouse monoclonal antibody (5F5, Cat# H00029978-M03, Novus Biologicals Inc. Littleton, CO). We made the other, which was raised in rabbit using a polypeptide of human ubiquilin2 (8aa-24 aa, NH2-SGPPRPSRGPAAAQGSA-COOH). The antiserum was affinity purified. Other polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that were used in this study included those against: ubiquitin (PRB-268C, Covance, Emeryville, CA; 10R-U101b, Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA; Ub (N-19): sc-6085, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p62 (H00008878-M01, Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan; NB110-74805, Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO), TDP43 (TIP-PTD-P01, Cosmo Bio Co, Tokyo, Japan; 10782-2-AP, ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL; 60019-2-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL; WH0023435M1-100UG, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), FUS (11570-1-AP, ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL), OPTN (100000, Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) and SOD1 35 , c-myc (MMS-150P, Covance, Emeryville), GFAP (Z0334, Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA; G3893, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), Iba1 (019-19741, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), and CNPase (MAB326R, Millipore, Temecula CA).

The basic protocols for immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy have been described in detail in a previous study 17 . In brief, 6 μm sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spinal cord and brain regions containing the frontal lobe or the hippocampus. The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with a descending series of diluted ethanol and water. Antigens in the sections were retrieved using a high pressure decloaking chamber. For immunohistochemistry, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 2% hydrogen peroxide. Non-specific background was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. The titers of the antibodies were determined based on preliminary studies using serial dilution of the antibodies. Various antibodies against ubiquilin2 or other proteins were used as primary antibodies. These antibodies included rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquilin2 (ubiquilin2-N; 0.5 μg/ml; generated by us), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquilin2 antibody (ubiquilin2-C; 0.2 μg/ml; H00029978-M03; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), rabbit polyclonal anti-FUS antibody (3 μg/ml; 11570-1-AP; ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL), mouse monoclonal anti-TDP43 antibody (1 μg/ml; 60019-2-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL), rabbit polyclonal anti-TDP43 antibody (0.1 μg/ml; 10782-2-AP; ProteinTech Group), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (0.5 μg/ml; 10R-U101B; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (0.5 μg/ml; PRB-268C, Covance, Emeryville, CA), goat polyclonal anti-ubiquitin (0.5 μg/ml; Ub (N-19):sc-6085; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-p62 antibody (1 μg/ml; H00008878-M01; Abnova Coporation, Taipei, Taiwan), rabbit polyclonal anti-optineurin antibodies (C-term, 0.2 μg/ml, 100000, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, biotinylated mouse anti-goat IgG or biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG were used as the secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive signals were detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as a chromogen. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and sealed with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polyscience, Warrington, PA).

For confocal microscopy, antibodies generated in different species were used in various combinations. These antibodies included those against ubiquilin2, FUS, TDP43, p62, optineurin, ubiquitin, c-myc, GFAP, Iba1 and CNPase. Fluorescence signals were detected with appropriate secondary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG conjugated with rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) using an LSM 510 META Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope with the multi-tracking setting 17 . The same pinhole diameter was used to acquire each channel.

Western blotting was performed using the protocol previously described 17 . Briefly, spinal cord tissues from lumbar segments were processed and homogenized. Cell lysates or the supernatants of tissue homogenates were subjected to total protein quantification, gel electrophoresis and blotted on PVDF membranes. Ubiquilin2 was detected using ubiquilin2-N or ubiquilin2-C antibody. The membranes were stripped and blotted with an antibody against β-actin, (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

A full length human cDNA clone (Homo sapiens ubiquilin 2, IMAGE:4543266) was used as a template for construction of the expression constructs. Two primers anchored with an Xho I (ubiquilin2-TP1, 5′-ttctcgagggccgccatggctgagaat-3′) and BamH I (ubiquilin2-TP2, 5′-catggatcctgtatgtctgtattacc-3′) were used to amplify the full length coding sequence. The amplified fragment was cloned into plasmid vector pBluescript M13. The ubiquilin2 sequence was verified by direct sequencing. Each of the P497H and P506T mutations was introduced into the plasmid vector by site-directed mutagenesis using a primer containing each respective mutation. The Xho I/ BamH I fragment containing wild-type UBQLN2, UBQLN2 P497H or UBQLN2 P506T was released from the pBluescript M13 vector and cloned into the Xho I and BamH I sites of dual expression vectors pIRES2-DsRed2 or pIRES2-ZsGreen1, to create such constructs as wtUBQLN2, ZsGreen1; mutant ubiquilin2 (P497H, or P506T) (mUBQLN2, ZsGreen1) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).

In addition, we generated seven other expression constructs, including wild-type ubiquilin2 tagged with GFP (wtUBQLN2-GFP), mutant ubiquilin2 (P497H or P506T) tagged with GFP (mUBQLN2-GFP), wild-type TDP43 tagged with mCherry (wtTDP43-mCherry), an ALS- and dementia-linked C-terminal fragment of TDP43 (amino acids 218–414, C-TDP43) 18 , 23 tagged with mCherry (C-TDP43-mCherry), wild-type FUS tagged with myc (myc-wtFUS) and mutant FUS (R495X) tagged with myc (myc-mFUS).

Cells of SH-SY5Y, Neuro2a and HEK293 lines were grown on collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 U/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with different combinations of expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

SH-SY5Y and Neuro2a cells were grown in 24-well plates and double-transfected with a UPS reporter vector containing Ub G76V -GFP 25 (Addgene plasmid #11941), and a dual expression vector containing DsRed2 with either wild-type or mutant ubiquilin2. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS. Ub G76V -GFP transfected cells were used for control experiments to test the functionality of the UPS reporter. In these control experiments, media was changed 24 hours post-transfection to that containing 5 μM of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (A.G. Scientific, Inc, San Diego, CA). Cells were incubated in this media for 24 hours and then harvested and resuspended in PBS. For cycloheximide chase of UB G76V -GFP, transiently transfected Neuro2a cells were used. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were transferred to medium containing 5 μM MG-132. After incubation with MG-132 for 16 hours to accumulate the Ub G76V -GFP reporter, cells were washed in sterile PBS and incubated with medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours. At each time point, cells were washed, harvested and resuspended in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. The fluorescence intensities at each time point were measured by FACS. The fluorescence intensity at time=0 hours was taken to be maximal fluorescence (100%). All flow cytometric data were collected and analyzed using a MoFlo cell sorter and Summit software (DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Argon-ion (488 nm) and yellow (565 nm) lasers were used for excitation. The GFP and DsRed2 signals were collected using 530/40 nm and 600/30 nm bandpass filters, respectively. In all experiments data were gated on GFP/DsRed2 dual-labeled cells. At least 500–1,000 such events were recorded in each experiment. The DsRed2 expression levels and profiles were similar across experiments. Data were collected from three independent experiments. Two-tailed unpaired Student t -test ( p <0.05) was used for statistical analysis.
