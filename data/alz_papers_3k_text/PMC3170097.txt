# Title
The aging systemic milieu negatively regulates neurogenesis and cognitive function

# Abstract
In the central nervous system (CNS), aging results in a precipitous decline in adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurogenesis, with concomitant impairments in cognitive functions 1 . Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through systemic perturbations such as exercise 1 . Here, using heterochronic parabiosis we show that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing a young animal to an old systemic environment, or to plasma from old mice, decreased synaptic plasticity and impaired contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. We identify chemokines - including CCL11/Eotaxin – whose plasma levels correlate with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts and aged mice, and whose levels are increased in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid of healthy aging humans. Finally, increasing peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis, and cognitive impairments, observed during aging can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.

## Methods
The following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory), C57BL/6 aged mice (National Institutes of Aging), Dcx-Luc mice 20 , and C57BL/6J-Act-GFP (Jackson Laboratory). For parabiosis experiments male and female C57BL/6 mouse cohorts were used. For all other in vivo pharmacological and behavioral studies young (2–3 months) wild type C57BL/6 male mice were used. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12 h light-dark cycle and all animal handling and use was in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the VA Palo Alto Committee on Animal Research.

Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry was performed on free-floating sections following standard published techniques 24 . Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline. Brains were removed and fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 48 h before they were sunk through 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were then sectioned coronally at 40 μm with a cryomicrotome (Leica Camera, Inc.) and stored in cryoprotective medium. Primary antibodies were: goat anti-Dcx (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat anti-BrdU (1:5000, Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.), goat anti-Sox2 (1:200; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000, Chemicon), mouse anti-GFAP (1:1500, DAKO), and mouse anti-CD68 (1:50, Serotec). After overnight incubation, primary antibody staining was revealed using biotinylated secondary antibodies and the ABC kit (Vector) with Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich) or fluorescence conjugated secondary antibodies. For BrdU labeling, brain sections were pre-treated with 2N HCl at 37°C for 30 min before incubation with primary antibody. For double-label immunofluorescence of BrdU/NeuN or BrdU/GFAP, sections were incubated overnight with rat anti-BrdU, rinsed, and incubated for 1hr with donkey anti-rat antibody (2.5 μg/ml, Vector) before they were stained with mouse anti-NeuN antibody. To estimate the total number of Dcx or Sox2 positive cells per DG immunopositive cells in the granule cell and subgranular cell layer of the DG were counted in every sixth coronal hemibrain section through the hippocampus and multiplied by 12.

50 mg/kg of BrdU was injected intraperitoneally into mice once a day for 6 days, and mice were sacrificed 28 days later or injected daily for 3 days before sacrifice. To estimate the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the brain, we performed DAB staining for BrdU on every sixth hemibrain section. The number of BrdU+ cells in the granule cell and subgranular cell layer of the DG were counted and multiplied by 12 to estimate the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the entire DG. To determine the fate of dividing cells a total of 200 BrdU-positive cells across 4–6 sections per mouse were analyzed by confocal microscopy for co-expression with NeuN and GFAP. The number of double-positive cells was expressed as a percentage of BrdU- positive cells.

Parabiosis surgery followed previously described procedures 19 . Pairs of mice were anesthetized and prepared for surgery. Mirror-image incisions at the left and right flanks, respectively, were made through the skin. Shorter incisions were made through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal openings of the adjacent parabionts were sutured together. Elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together and the skin of each mouse was stapled (9mm Autoclip, Clay Adams) to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with Baytril antibiotic and Buprenex as directed for pain and monitored during recovery. Flow cytometric analysis was done on fixed and permeabilized blood plasma cells from GFP and non-GFP parabionts. Approximately 40–60% of cells in the blood of either parabiont were GFP-positive two weeks after parabiosis surgery. We observed 70–80% survival rate in parabionts five weeks post parabiosis surgery.

Acute hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were prepared from unpaired and young parabionts. Slices were maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) continuously oxygenated with 5% CO 2 /95% O 2 . ACSF composition was as follows: (in mM): NaCl 124.0; KCl 2.5; KH 2 PO4 1.2; CaCl 2 2.4; MgSO 4 1.3; NaHCO 3 26.0; glucose 10.0 (pH 7.4). Recordings were performed with an Axopatch- 2B amplifier and pClamp 10.2 software (Axon Instruments). Submerged slices were continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of 2 ml/min from a reservoir by gravity feeding. Field potential (population spikes and EPSP) was recorded using glass microelectrodes filled with ACSF (resistance: 4–8 MΩ). Biphasic current pulses (0.2 ms duration for one phase, 0.4ms in total) were delivered in 10 s intervals through a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, Inc.). No obvious synaptic depression or facilitation was observed with this frequency stimulation. To record field population spikes in the dentate gyrus, the recording electrode was placed in the lateral or medial side of the dorsal part of the dentate gyrus. The stimulating electrode was placed right above the hippocampal fissure to stimulate the perforant pathway fibers. Signals were filtered at 1 KHz and digitized at 10 KHz. Tetanic stimulation consisted of 2 trains of 100 pulses (0.4 ms pulse duration, 100 Hz) delivered with an inter-train interval of 5 seconds. The amplitude of population spike was measured from the initial phase of the negative wave. Up to five consecutive traces were averaged for each measurement. Synaptic transmission was assessed by generating input-output curves, with stimulus strength adjusted to be ~30% of the maximum. LTP was calculated as mean percentage change in the amplitude of the population spike following high frequency stimulation relative to its basal amplitude.

Paradigm was done following previously published techniques 27 . In this task, mice learned to associate the environmental context (fear conditioning chamber) with an aversive stimulus (mild foot shock; unconditioned stimulus, US) enabling testing for hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning. As contextual fear conditioning is hippocampus and amygdala dependent, the mild foot shock was paired with a light and tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) in order to also assess amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning. Conditioned fear was displayed as freezing behavior. Specific training parameters are as follows: tone duration is 30 seconds; level is 70 dB, 2 kHz; shock duration is 2 seconds; intensity is 0.6 mA. This intensity is not painful and can easily be tolerated but will generate an unpleasant feeling. More specifically, on day 1 each mouse was placed in a fear-conditioning chamber and allowed to explore for 2 minutes before delivery of a 30-second tone (70 dB) ending with a 2-second foot shock (0.6mA). Two minutes later, a second CS-US pair was delivered. On day 2 each mouse was first place in the fear-conditioning chamber containing the same exact context, but with no adminstration of a CS or foot shock. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 minutes. One hour later, the mice were placed in a new context containing a different odor, cleaning solution, floor texture, chamber walls and shape. Animals were allowed to explore for 2 minutes before being re-exposed to the CS. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 minutes. Freezing was measured using a FreezeScan video tracking system and software (Cleversys, Inc).

Spatial learning and memory was assessed using the radial arm water maze (RAWM) paradigm following the exact protocol described by Alamed et al. 26 . The goal arm location containing a platform remains constant throughout the training and testing phase, while the start arm is changed during each trial. On day one during the training phase, mice are trained for 15 trials, with trials alternating between a visible and hidden platform. On day two during the testing phase, mice are tested for 15 trials with a hidden platform. Entry into an incorrect arm is scored as an error, and errors are averaged over training blocks (three consecutive trials).

Adult mice (8–12 weeks) were sham irradiated (controls) or irradiated at 5 Gy three times over eight days using the Mark I gamma irradiator and sacrificed at 8–10 weeks after irradiation to collect brains for immunohistochemical analyses. Each mouse was placed in a restrainer that was fitted into a slot in the lead brick shield so that the back of the skull was facing the source of radiation when positioned in the radiation chamber. The shield is constructed of lead bricks such that only the hippocampal/midbrain area were exposed to radiation. Calibration for 5 Gy radiation was done using nanoDot. Shielded areas were protected with an exposure rate 10 times lower than the exposed area. RAWM studies were done on irradiated mice at least 6 weeks after the radiation procedure. This time frame ensured adequate recovery of the animals. All data were from 8 irradiated and 10 sham irradiated mice.

Mouse blood was collected from 400–500 young (2–3 months) and old (18–22 months) animals into EDTA coated tubes via tail vein bleed, mandibular vein bleed, or intracardial bleed at time of sacrifice. EDTA plasma was generated by centrifugation of freshly collected blood and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Human plasma and CSF samples were obtained from academic centers and subjects were chosen based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria as previously described 28 , 29 . The relative plasma concentrations of cytokines and signaling molecules were measured in human and mouse plasma samples using standard antibody-based multiplex immunoassays (Luminex) by either Rules Based Medicine Inc., a fee-for-service provider, or by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. All Luminex measurements where obtained in a blinded fashion. All assays were developed and validated to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) guidelines based upon the principles of immunoassay as described by the manufacturers.

Carrier free recombinant murine CCL11 dissolved in PBS (10ug/kg; R&D Systems), carrier free recombinant MCSF dissolved in PBS (10ug/kg; Biogen), rat IgG2a neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL11 (50ug/ml; R&D Systems, Clone: 42285), and isotype matched control rat IgG2a recommended by the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Clone: 54447) were administered systemically via intraperitoneal injection over ten days on day 1, 4, 7, and 10. The same reagents (0.50ul; 0.1ug/ul) were also administered stereotaxically into the DG of the hippocampus in some experiments (coordinates from bregma: A = −2.0mm and L = −1.8mm, from brain surface: H = −2.0mm). Pooled mouse serum or plasma was collected from young (2–3 months) mice and old (18–20 months) mice by intracardial bleed at time of sacrifice. Serum was prepared from clotted blood collected without anticoagulants; plasma was prepared from blood collected with EDTA followed by centrifugation. Aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Prior to administration plasma was dialyzed in PBS to remove EDTA. Young adult mice were systemically treated with plasma (100ul) isolated from young or aged mice via intravenous injections four times over ten days.

Bioluminescence was detected with the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS Spectrum; Caliper Life Science). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150mg/kg D-luciferin (Xenogen) 10 minutes before imaging and anesthetized with isofluorane during imaging. Photons emitted from living mice were acquired as photons/s/cm 2 /steridan (sr) using LIVINGIMAGE software (version 3.5, Caliper) and integrated over 5 minutes. For quantification a region of interest was manually selected and kept constant for all experiments.

Mouse neural progenitor cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice as previously described 12 . Brains from postnatal animals (1 day-old) were dissected to remove olfactory bulb, cerebellum and brainstem. After removing superficial blood vessels forebrains were finely minced, digested for 30 minutes at 37°C in DMEM media containing 2.5U/ml Papain (Worthington Biochemicals), 1U/ml Dispase II (Boeringher Mannheim), and 250U/ml DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals) and mechanically dissociated. NSC/progenitors were purified using a 65% Percoll gradient and plated on uncoated tissue culture dishes at a density of 10 5 cells/cm 2 . NPCs were cultured under standard conditions in NeuroBasal A medium supplemented with penicillin (100U/ml), streptomycin (100mg/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine, serum-free B27 supplement without vitamin A (Sigma-Aldrich), bFGF (20ng/ml) and EGF (20ng/ml). Carrier free forms of murine recombinant CCL2 (100ng/ml; R&D Systems), murine recombinant CCL11 (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems), rat IgG2b neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL2 (10ug/ml; R&D Systems, Clone: 123616), control rat IgG2b (10ug/ml; R&D Systems, Clone: 141945), goat IgG neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL11 (10ug/ml; R&D Systems), and control goat IgG (10ug/ml; R&D Systems) were dissolved in PBS and added to cell cultures under self-renewal conditions every other day following cell plating.

Human NTERA cells 7 expressing eGFP under the doublecortin promoter were cultured under standard self-renewal and differentiation conditions 30 , 31 . Carrier free forms of human recombinant CCL2 (100ng/ml, R&D Systems), human recombinant CCL11 (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems), mouse IgG 1 neutralizing antibody against human CCL11 (25ug/ml; R&D Systems, Clone: 43911) and control mouse IgG 1 (25ug/ml; R&D Systems) were added to cell cultures under differentiation conditions every other day following cell plating.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared with two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. Comparisons of means from multiple groups with each other or against one control group were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer’s or Dunnett’s post hoc tests, respectively. Plasma protein correlations in the aging samples were analyzed with the Significance Analysis of Microarray software ( SAM 3.00 algorithm; http://www.stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.htm ). Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed using Gene Cluster 3.0 software and node maps were produced using Java TreeView 1.0.13 software. All histology, electrophysiology and behavior experiments conducted were done in a randomized and blinded fashion.
