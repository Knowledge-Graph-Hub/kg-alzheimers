Peripherally Applied Aβ-Containing Inoculates Induce Cerebral β-Amyloidosis

# Abstract
The intracerebral injection of β-amyloid-containing brain extracts can induce cerebralβ-amyloidosis and associated pathologies in susceptible hosts. We found that intraperitoneal inoculation with β-amyloid-rich extracts inducesβ-amyloidosis in the brains of β-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice after prolonged incubation times.
