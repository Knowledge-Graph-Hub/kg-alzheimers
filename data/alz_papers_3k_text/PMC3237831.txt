# Title
Secondary nucleating sequences affect kinetics and thermodynamics of tau aggregation

# Abstract
Tau protein was scanned for highly amyloidogenic sequences in amphiphilic motifs (X) n Z, Z(X) n Z (n≥2) or (XZ) n (n≥2), where X is a hydrophobic residue and Z is a charged or polar residue. N-acetyl peptides homologous to these sequences were used to study aggregation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed 7 peptides, in addition to well known primary nucleating sequences c 275 VQIINK (AcPHF6*) and Ac 306 VQIVYK (AcPHF6), formed fibers, tubes, ribbons or rolled sheets. Of the peptides shown by TEM to form amyloid, Ac 10 VME, AcPHF6*, Ac 375 KLTFR, and Ac 393 VYK were found to enhance the fraction of β-structure of AcPHF6 formed at equilibrium, and Ac 375 KLTFR was found to inhibit AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* aggregation kinetics in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with its participation in a hybrid steric zipper model. Single site mutants were generated which transformed predicted amyloidogenic sequences in tau into non-amyloidogenic ones. A M11K mutant had fewer filaments and showed a decrease in aggregation kinetics and an increased lag time compared to wild type tau, while a F378K mutant showed significantly more filaments. Our results infer that sequences throughout tau, in addition to PHF6 and PHF6*, can seed amyloid formation or affect aggregation kinetics or thermodynamics.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fmoc-amino acids were purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). High molecular weight heparin (HMWH; porcine mucosa; 18 kDa average MW; 6–30 kDa range) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, MO) and was used without further purification. All other chemicals and buffers were of Reagent grade.

Tau protein was scanned for sequences which satisfied the amphiphilic motifs (X) n Z, Z(X) n Z or (XZ) n (n≥2), where X is a hydrophobic and Z is a polar or charged amino acid residue. Amyloidogenic propensities of sequences satisfying these motifs were evaluated using the sum of the absolute values of their constituent residue PC1 scores ( 40 ).

N-acetyl peptide amides corresponding to potentially nucleating sequences selected in tau were prepared according to previously published procedures and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a water-acetonitrile gradient ( 23 , 40 , 41 ). Purity was checked using ESI-MS or MALDI-TOF MS.

Stock solutions of the peptides were prepared (~1–5 mg/mL) in deionized water. Final peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance using published molar extinction coefficients for tyrosine [ε 276 of 1390 M −1 cm −1 ] or for the peptide bond [ε 192 of 7110 M −1 cm −1 ]( 42 , 43 ). For CD measurements, peptide stocks were diluted to 100 μM in 5 mM MOPS/0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2 (MOPS-Cl buffer) containing 0.1 mg/mL of heparin. Samples were transferred to a 0.1 cm path length quartz cell and bath sonicated for 1 min. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired an AVIV 202 CD spectrophotometer, following a 1 h incubation at room temperature in ( 23 , 40 , 44 ). CD measurements of peptide binary mixtures were prepared in a similar manner with each of the peptides present at 100 μM. In order to calculate mean residue molar ellipticity, the total number of residues was set to the sum of the total number of residues in the peptides included in the mixture.

Samples for TEM were prepared from peptide stock solutions in MOPS-Cl buffer containing 0.3 mg/mL heparin. Following incubation overnight at room temperature, samples were loaded onto carbon-coated Formvar copper grids (200 mesh) and stained with 2% wt/wt uranyl acetate. A JEOL 1200 EX scope interfaced to a digital camera was used to visualize samples. Distance measurements were made using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, Inc., San Jose, CA).

Polymerization kinetics were measured by monitoring the increase in Thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence at 490 nm (440 nm excitation) in a manner similar to that used to follow aggregation in other amyloid-forming peptides and proteins ( 40 , 41 , 45 – 47 ). For each peptide, a 1 mg/mL sample stock solution was filtered through a Millipore Ultrafree-MC 100,000 NMWL filter unit (Billerica, MA) by centrifuging for 10 minutes at 14,500 rpm, using an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus bench top centrifuge (Westbury, NY). Following filtration, the concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance. Stock solutions were then diluted in 200 μL wells of a 96-well clear bottom ELISA plate such that the final concentrations were 100 μM peptide, 0.3 mg/mL heparin, 100 μM ThS, in MOPS-Cl buffer or in 5 mM sodium phosphate containing 0.15 M NaCl, pH 3.0 (phosphate-Cl buffer). Fluorescence data were collected in triplicate in kinetic mode, using a Molecular Devices SPECTRA Max Gemini XPS spectrofluorimeter (Sunnyvale, CA), with measurements taken at 15 s intervals. Mixing between readings was accomplished using a 1/8″ PTFE Grade 2 polished mixing bead (Orange Products, Allentown, PA). In order to minimize time before the first data was collected, peptide solutions were added just before the commencement of the readings. A blank containing only buffer, heparin and ThS was recorded concurrently with the samples. Baseline corrected kinetic data were fit to Gompetz growth curves according to

[1] y = e − k ′ t A e − e ( ( t − t i ) b ) where y is defined as the fluorescence signal at time t , t i corresponds to the inflection point of the curve or the time of maximum growth rate, A is the maximum fluorescence observed for a given sample, and b =1/ k app , where k app is the rate constant of aggregation, in units of s −1 . The pre-growth curve exponential, e (−k′t) , was inserted into the traditional Gompetz growth curve equation to take into account the slow decrease in fluorescent intensity resulting from ThS bleaching, quenching and gravitational precipitation of the amyloid-ThS complex ( 40 , 48 ). Each experiment showing peptide aggregation was run 3 times and the error in fitted parameters was determined from the standard deviation of the fitted parameters. Kinetic data for mixtures of some peptides were fit to a sum of growth curve functions according to

[2] y = A e − e ( ( t − t ′ ) b ) + A ′ e − e ( ( t − t ″ ) b ′ ) where b′ = 1/ k′ app .

Site directed tau mutants M11K, F378K and Y394K were generated from 2N4R tau (pT7C-htau40 (a gift from Dr. Jeff Kuret)) using the Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit following manufacturer’s protocols. Primers for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The 6x his-tagged proteins were purified using Ni 2+ charged Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography, followed by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography as previously described ( 49 ). 2 μM of wild type or mutants of 2N4R tau (M11K, F378K, and Y394K) were incubated with 75 μM arachidonic acid in polymerization buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.64, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) for 240 minutes at room temperature. Right angle laser light scattering (LLS) readings were taken at various time points, and images were analyzed by Adobe Photoshop for histogram intensity of the light scattering band ( 50 ). Data was fit to the Gompertz growth curve as previously described. A (final extent of polymerization), k app (proportional to the rate of polymerization), and lag (time until significant polymerization), which equals t i -b, were determined as the mean ± SEM of 3 trials ( 51 ). After 240 minutes, reactions were diluted 1:10 and fixed with 10% glutaraldehyde. TEM grids were prepared and filaments were stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were collected at 3600x using a Technai F20 XT Field Emission TEM (FEI). Quantitation of 5 TEM images for filament number, length and mass per field was done using Image Pro Plus 6 with a minimum length cutoff of 15 nm.

## RESULTS
In a previous study we used a family of tau related peptides, AcVQIVXK, to define an amyloidogenic propensity of the amino acid residue X based on a group of experimental observables typically used to define amyloid ( 40 ). We found that peptide sequences with an amphiphilic motif (X) n Z, where X is a hydrophobic residue and Z is a charged or polar amino acid, have a high propensity to act as nucleating sequences. Others have shown that amphiphilic sequences in which hydrophobic and polar residues alternate above and below the extended peptide chain ((XZ) n (n≥2)) or have a Z(X) n Z motif also have a high tendency to nucleate amyloid formation ( 24 , 52 – 55 ). We scanned tau protein for these amyloid-forming motifs and calculated their amyloidogenic propensities using their constituent residue amyloidogenic propensity scores. Using this approach we found 20 high propensity sequences ( Fig. 1 ): 8 sequences ( 5 RQEFEV, 10 VME, 17 TYGLG, 28 GYTMHQDQ, 40 DAGLK, 87 KQAAAQ, 126 RMV, 225 KVAVVR) in the N-terminal region, 6 in the microtubule binding region ( 242 RLQ in R1; 275 VQIINK (PHF6*) and 282 LDLSN in R2; 306 VQIVYK (PHF6) in R3; 337 VEVK and 343 KLDFK in R4), and 6 in the C-terminal region ( 375 KLTFR, 382 AKAK, 393 VYK, 419 MVD, 428 LAD, 432 VSASL). Of these, PHF6* and PHF6 in the MTBR have been shown experimentally to act as nucleating sequences in tau related peptides or full length tau protein ( 19 ).

We prepared all 20 predicted amyloidogenic sequences as their N-acetyl peptide amides, since N- and C-terminal charges have been shown to have a profound effect on the ability of a peptide to form amyloid ( 56 ). We studied the behavior of these peptides in the presence of HMW heparin, a known polyanion inducer of tau protein aggregation ( 19 , 29 , 45 , 46 , 57 – 60 ). Using TEM, we observed fibers with diameters between 3 – 7 nm for Ac 5 RQEFEV, Ac 40 DAGLK, AcPHF6*, AcPHF6, Ac 343 KLDFK, Ac 375 KLTFR, Ac 393 VYK, and Ac 419 MVD following overnight incubation in MOPS-Cl buffer with HMW heparin (MOPS-Cl-HMWH; Fig. 2 ). We also observed tubes, ribbons and rolled sheets for Ac 10 VME, AcPHF6*, and Ac 375 KLTFR. TEM data for these peptides can be found in Table 1 .

TEM is perhaps the most sensitive measure of the ability of a peptide to form amyloid since the hydrophobic nature of amyloid structures are attracted to the hydrophobic surface of the carbon-coated TEM grid. Previously, we observed amyloid fibers formed from peptides containing proline, a known β-sheet breaking amino acid residue. However, it was later determined by other measurements that the majority of the peptide existed in a random coil conformation ( 40 ). Hence, the TEM experiment is biased toward the observation of amyloid-like structures, even when only a relatively small fraction of the sample forms amyloid. Equally important are those sequences that were not observed to form amyloid structures by TEM. These sequences can be eliminated as nucleating sequences and are less likely to affect the kinetics of amyloid formation by their interaction with other nucleating sequences in the protein.

We used CD spectroscopy to study the conformation of the predicted amyloid forming sequences in tau. In water, the CD of AcPHF6 ( Fig. 3A ) and AcPHF6* (not shown) displayed a pattern characteristic of random coil peptides with near zero ellipticity at higher wavelength and a single negative band present near 195 nm. Under these conditions these nucleating peptides possess a very low fraction of characteristic of aggregating species having a significant fraction of β-sheet structure. In MOPS-Cl-HMWH, the CD spectra of AcPHF6* and AcPHF6 showed classical spectra of extended β-sheet, with a negative nπ* band at 217 nm and a positive ππ* band near 198 nm ( 23 , 61 ). With the exception of Ac 393 VYK and Ac 10 VME, other peptides studied showed patterns characteristic of random coil peptides in MOPS-Cl-HMWH. The tripeptides Ac 393 VYK and Ac 10 VME displayed a CD spectra which appeared to be a combination of spectra arising from β-sheet and random coil structures, having a negative shoulder between 215 and 220 nm and a strong negative band below 198 nm.

We used CD to study the interaction between peptides in MOPS-Cl-HMWH. Figure 3B shows the CD of AcPHF6, Ac 10 VME, a 1:1 mixture of the two peptides and the CD that would be calculated from the spectra of the peptides by themselves, in the absence of any interaction. As expected, there is a negative 215 nm band for the calculated spectra for AcPHF6 and Ac 10 VME (dashed line), with an intensity that is half way between that for the spectra of the two peptides alone. In contrast, the observed CD spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of the two peptides (solid line) has a negative 215 nm band with an intensity significantly more negative than the calculated spectrum, suggesting that Ac 10 VME interacts with AcPHF6 to shift the equilibrium towards the aggregated form. It is also noteworthy that the observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shares an isodichroic point at 205 nm with the spectra of the two isolated peptides, suggesting that only two forms of the peptides, monomeric and aggregated, are present ( 37 ). A plausible model for this type of interaction is one in which Ac 10 VME participates in the same β-sheet structure characteristic of the AcPHF6 amyloidogenic state. In contrast, the spectrum of a AcPHF6:AcPHF6* mixture ( Fig. 3C ) does not appear to share an isodichroic point with spectra of the two pure peptides, suggesting a type of interaction involving something more complex than a simple two state model.

We define a positive interaction as one in which the observed CD of a 1:1 mixture is more negative above (higher wavelength) the isodichroic point and more positive below this point. In contrast, a negative interaction implies that a smaller fraction of the sample exists in an aggregated state when the two peptides are mixed. A summary of the results is presented in Fig. 3D . The greatest positive interactions with AcPHF6 result from peptides Ac 10 VME, AcPHF6*, Ac 375 KLTFR and Ac 393 VYK while the greatest positive interactions with AcPHF6* result from AcPHF6, and from C-terminal sequences Ac 375 KLTFR, Ac 393 VYK, Ac 419 MVD, Ac 428 LAD, and Ac 432 VSASL. It should be noted that interactions evaluated in this manner are a reflection of pairwise interactions at thermodynamic equilibrium and do not necessarily reflect how these interactions will affect aggregation kinetics.

The kinetics of aggregation of tau peptides was measured in MOPS-Cl-HMWH by following the time dependence of ThS fluorescence at 490 nm, and fitting the data to Gompertz growth curves ( 20 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 47 , 48 ). Under these conditions only AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* displayed measurable aggregation (k app = 23.3±1.4 × 10 −3 s −1 and 9.2±0.7 × 10 −3 s −1 , respectively). We also measured aggregation of these two peptides in the presence of the other predicted amyloidogenic peptides by mixing peptides at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Only Ac 275 KLTFR had any significant effect on the aggregation (p≤0.05), slowing the aggregation kinetics of both AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* (19.4 ± 0.5 × 10 −3 s −1 and 3.9 ± 0.6 × 10 −3 s −1 ). The effect of Ac 275 KLTFR on the aggregation of AcPHF6* is shown in Fig. 4A as a function of increasing Ac 275 KLTFR:AcPHF6* stoichiometry. At less than a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio Ac 275 KLTFR acts as an aggregation inhibitor, affecting both the k app and the lag time, while at a 2:1 Ac 275 KLTFR:AcPHF6* stoichiometric ratio there are two discernable aggregation events. Plots of log(k app ) and lag time obtained from fitting vs. Ac 275 KLTFR:AcPHF6* stoichiometry for the first aggregation event showed a linear relationship ( Fig. 5 ; r 2 ≥ 0.97), suggesting that both nucleation and elongation are affected in a nucleation-elongation mechanism.

We found it surprising that Ac 275 KLTFR was an inhibitor of AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* aggregation, but that Ac 343 KLDFK, a peptide whose sequence is homologous, was not. We hypothesized that it may be the charge-charge repulsion between aspartic acid sidechains that led to its inability to fit into the AcPHF6 or AcPHF6* steric-zipper structure. To test this hypothesis we measured the aggregation of AcPHF6* at different stoichiometric ratios of Ac 343 KLDFK:AcPHF6* in phosphate buffer at pH 3.0, where the aspartic acid carboxyl is uncharged ( Fig. 4B ). Under these conditions Ac 343 KLDFK inhibits the aggregation of AcPHF6* in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the inhibition by Ac 275 KLTFR at higher pH. A plot of log(k app ) vs. Ac 343 KLDFK:AcPHF6* stoichiometry was linear ( Fig. 5A ) but we did not observe a linear dependence in lag time with increasing Ac 343 KLDFK concentration.

Fig. 4C shows the effect that mixing AcPHF6* with AcPHF6 at 1:1 stoichiometry has on aggregation kinetics. Using the same fitted kinetic parameters that we obtained from the kinetics of AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* aggregation, we simulated the aggregation of the AcPHF6:AcPHF6* mixture from a sum of growth curves (dashed line). While the curve comes close to the observed data at short times, it deviates from the data at longer time points. The data could be fit to a sum of growth curves by varying the kinetic parameters for both AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* (solid line) and we found the best fit could be obtained with a significantly faster k app for AcPHF6* (46 ±3 × 10 −3 s −1 ) and a significantly slower k app for AcPHF6* (5.6 ± 0.6 × 10 −3 s −1 ), again suggesting a complex kinetic interaction between these two peptides.

While the CD interaction experiments and kinetic studies on predicted amyloidogenic tau peptides suggest that interactions between sequences may effect tau aggregation rate or the overall fraction of tau participating in an aggregated state, they do not address whether such interactions take place intra- or intermolecularly or what additional constraints the full protein may impose. To address this issue we prepared 3 single site mutants of tau (M11K, F378K, and Y394K) that were predicted to decrease the amyloidogenic propensities of 10 VME, 275 KLTFR and 393 VYK by substituting a positively charged lysine for a hydrophobic residue ( 40 ). Kinetics of polymerization for 2N4R lysine mutants were assayed by right angle laser light scattering against wild-type tau ( Figure 6A ). M11K showed a significantly longer lag time than WT (12.69 ± 3.41 min compared to 7.20 ± 0.61 min; p ≤ 0.05) while F378K and Y394K showed no significant difference (7.41 ± 0.07 min and 7.22 ± 0.42 min respectively). The k app for M11K decreased significantly (0.09 ± 0.03; p ≤ 0.05), while the k app for F378K (0.17 ± 0.05) and Y394K (0.15 ± 0.007) were slightly larger than k app for WT (0.13 ± 0.02). M11K, F378K and Y394K showed a trend for slightly higher maximum light scattering values (126.63 ± 18.92, 110.50 ± 13.55, and 113.87 ± 15.16 respectively) than WT (95.40 ± 5.22). TEM images, however, showed no difference in the morphology of filaments ( Figure 6B-E ). Quantitation of filaments revealed M11K had significantly fewer filaments, while F378K had significantly more filaments (p ≤ 0.0001) and Y394K had approximately the same number as compared to WT ( Figure 6F ). Filament lengths were only increased in M11K as compared to WT, with F378K and Y394K having the same average length of filaments per field ( Figure 6G ). The mass of filaments per field (length × number) was similar to the changes seen for the number of filaments per field ( Figure 6H ).

## DISCUSSION
Whether or not proteins form amyloid depends on the presence of nucleating sequences or “hot spots”, short sequences of amino acids that have a high propensity (HP) to form parallel or anti-parallel β-sheet structure between protein monomers ( 62 – 65 ). However, the presence of these nucleating sequences is not a sufficient condition for oligomerization, particularly for most proteins where HP sequences occur on the interior of the protein ( 63 , 66 ). Perturbation of the protein away from its native conformation, either by partial denaturation or by the presence of mutations, controls the exposure of these sequences to the solvent and thus controls their ability to interact intermolecularly with other monomers and form toxic oligomers or filaments ( 62 , 64 ). In “natively unfolded” proteins or peptides, HP sequences may inhibit the formation of amyloid, either by controlling the folding of the backbone or by forming intramolecular β-structure ( 62 , 67 , 68 ). Tau is a loosely folded flexible protein with two nucleating sequences, PHF6* and PHF6 at the beginning of R2 and R3 in the MTBR ( 19 , 31 , 69 ). The PHF core is formed by only a portion of tau near the C-terminal, including the MTBR, while N-terminal forms the outer “fuzzy coat” of PHF ( 14 , 70 – 72 ). Shorter tau related peptides containing PHF6 & PHF6* aggregate much more rapidly than full length tau, suggesting that other segments of the full length protein assume a regulatory role by interacting intramolecularly with the MTBR region ( 23 , 40 , 73 ). Other segments of tau distant from the nucleating PHF6 and PHF6* regions, such as the N-terminal inserts, tend to promote aggregation ( 33 , 38 ).

Given the evidence suggesting that regions of tau remote from the MTBR are instrumental in regulating polymerization, we were curious to see if (1) HP sequences, other than PHF6 and PHF6*, could nucleate filament formation and (2) HP sequences could interact with the known nucleating sequences PHF6 or PHF6* to increase the fraction of β-sheet structure present or to control aggregation kinetics. We scanned tau for HP motifs and quantitated their propensities using an algorithm previously described by us ( 40 ). Other algorithms exist for determining sequence amyloidogenic propensity based on sequence or on their interaction energy with other nucleating sequences ( 58 , 74 – 77 ). While they are able to find PHF6 and PHF6* in tau, no other potential HP regions have been reported. Our model flagged 20 HP sequences, including 87 KQAAAQ, 225 KVAVVR, and 337 VEVK, in addition to PHF6 and PHF6*. These sequences have previously been shown to populate β-sheet structure by NMR studies of full length tau protein ( 31 ). In summary, our simple method of finding potential HP regions of tau is capable of locating sequences that other more complex algorithms can not, although it may be that our method is so sensitive that it flags sequences which neither form amyloid nor interact with other known nucleating sequences.

We used TEM to experimentally evaluate the amyloid forming propensity of N-acetylated peptide amides with sequences identical to the 20 HP sequences in tau flagged by our algorithm. Filaments and tubes were observed for N-terminal peptides Ac 5 RQEFEV 10 and Ac 10 VME. In the past, a Δ2–18 mutant has been shown to aggregate less effectively than wild type tau, suggesting that residues in the N-terminal help seed aggregation in the presence of arachidonic acid inducer ( 33 ). Tau with frontotemporal dementia mutation R5L aggregates faster than wild type tau and forms 4.5 times more filaments, again emphasizing the role this segment plays in oligomerization ( 33 ). We observed rolled sheets, fibers and ribbons for AcPHF6* and filaments for AcPHF6 and Ac 343 KLDFK. These sequences occur in the MTBR and have previously been shown by NMR to populate β-sheet structure ( 31 , 57 , 78 , 79 ). We observed no amyloid structures for Ac 87 KQAAAQ, Ac 225 KVAVVR, or Ac 337 VEVK, sequences which were observed to populate β-structure in the NMR of full length tau ( 31 ). We observed rolled sheets and fiber bundles for Ac 375 KLTFR, a sequence in tau which lies just downstream of R4, and has been shown by NMR to be in an inflexible region of PHFs ( 69 ). We have previously shown that Ac 393 VYK forms filaments, and mixtures of AcPHF6 and Ac 393 VYK form twisted filaments with identical morphology to bona fide PHFs ( 23 ). The 392 IVYK sequence likely is the nucleation sequence for the amyloid formed from the 383-337 C-tail 8 peptide, previously shown to possess a high degree of β-sheet structure and form filaments in the absence of polyanion inducer ( 37 ). We also observed fibers and spherical aggregates for the peptide Ac 419 MVD. Caspase-3 mediated cleavage after Asp421 can be detected in mild cognitive impairment and AD but not in non-demented control brains ( 7 ). It is tempting to speculate that C-terminal truncation at this site may allow the 419 MVD sequence sufficient solvent accessibility to help seed oligomerization.

Only AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* showed measurable aggregation kinetics as well as a high fraction of β-structure at equilibrium determined by CD. Of the peptides shown by TEM to form amyloid, Ac 10 VME, AcPHF6*, Ac 375 KLTFR, and Ac 393 VYK were found to enhance the fraction of β-structure of AcPHF6 formed at equilibrium, and Ac 375 KLTFR was found to affect AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* aggregation kinetics. Others have shown that interactions between PHF6 and PHF6* exist in tau or tau related peptides ( 19 – 22 , 27 , 28 ). Ac 375 KLTFR slowed the aggregation kinetics of AcPHF6 by roughly 15% but slowed the k app for AcPHF6* aggregation by 60% at 1:1 stoichiometry. We obtained linear plots of log(k app ) or lag time for the first aggregation event versus the Ac 375 KLTFR/AcPHF6* ratio, suggesting that Ac 375 KLTFR acts as a competitive inhibitor of AcPHF6* aggregation. Given the sequence homology between Ac 375 KLTFR and Ac 343 KLDFK, we found it surprising that Ac 343 KLDFK was not also an inhibitor of AcPHF6* aggregation. However, we found that Ac 343 KLDFK was an inhibitor at pH 3.0 where the carboxyl of the aspartic acid sidechain is protonated. Apparently its limited ability to inhibit AcPHF6* aggregation arises from unfavorable interaction between the charged carboxylate sidechains in the peptide at neutral pH. Both Ac 343 KLDFK and Ac 375 KLTFR satisfy a model based on the steric-zipper where they occur in alternating layers with AcPHF6*. A hypothetic model shows antiparallel layers of parallel in-register peptide β-structure ( Fig. 7 ) ( 24 , 25 ).

Although data from studies with HP peptides suggest that the sequences 10 VME, 375 KLTFR and 393 VYK have the potential of interacting with PHF6 and PHF6* to enhance the fraction of amyloid present or inhibit the rate of aggregation, it is difficult to predict how these interactions will influence tau aggregation without having some idea of solvent accessibility. Intramolecular interactions which enhance amyloid formation might be expected to inhibit oligomerization while similar intermolecular interactions would be expected to enhance it. In the past, we and others have shown that two consecutive C-terminal positively charged residues transform an amyloidogenic sequence into a non-amyloidogenic one ( 40 , 41 , 55 ). In the case of the M11K mutant, fewer filaments were observed and there was an increase in lag time and a decrease in the rate of aggregation compared to wild type tau, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence 10 VME enhances arachidonic acid induced nucleation and elongation. In contrast, the F378K mutant showed an increased rate of aggregation and more filaments compared to wild type tau. Because of the proximity of the 375 KLTFR sequence to PHF6 and PHF6*, it is tempting to speculate that the region just downstream of MTBR interacts intramolecularly with these nucleating sequences, protecting them from interacting intermolecularly. The Y394K mutant produced about the same number of filaments and had a similar rate of aggregation as wild type tau. This result is consistent with NMR evidence which shows that 392 IVYK does not form β-structure in full length tau ( 31 , 37 , 59 ).

In conclusion, we have shown that HP sequences in tau other than PHF6 and PHF6* can nucleate amyloid formation and can help regulate the kinetics of amyloid formation. That being said, amyloid nucleation is a complex event in tau, governed by the folding of the peptide backbone, phosphorylation of amino acid side chains, environmental conditions (reducing or non-reducing, salt concentration, pH), the nature of polyanionic or long chain fatty acid inducers, and other HP sequences remote from the primary nucleating site ( 16 , 31 , 36 , 60 ). These secondary HP sequences in tau or other proteins may have evolved in order to protect biological systems from protein oligomerization and toxicity.
