# Title
Pericytes are required for blood–brain barrier integrity during embryogenesis

# Abstract
Vascular endothelial cells in the central nervous system(CNS) forma barrier that restricts the movement of molecules and ions between the blood and the brain. This blood–brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to ensure proper neuronal function and protect the CNS from injury and disease 1 . Transplantation studies have demonstrated that the BBB is not intrinsic to the endothelial cells, but is induced by interactions with the neural cells 2 . Owing to the close spatial relationship between astrocytes and endothelial cells, it has been hypothesized that astrocytes induce this critical barrier postnatally 3 , but the timing of BBB formation has been controversial 4 – 9 . Here we demonstrate that the barrier is formed during embryogenesis as endothelial cells invade the CNS and pericytes are recruited to the nascent vessels, over a week before astrocyte generation. Analysing mice with null and hypomorphic alleles of Pdgfrb , which have defects in pericyte generation, we demonstrate that pericytes are necessary for the formation of the BBB, and that absolute pericyte coverage determines relative vascular permeability. We demonstrate that pericytes regulate functional aspects of the BBB, including the formation of tight junctions and vesicle trafficking in CNS endothelial cells. Pericytes do not induce BBB-specific gene expression in CNS endothelial cells, but inhibit the expression of molecules that increase vascular permeability and CNS immune cell infiltration. These data indicate that pericyte–endothelial cell interactions are critical to regulate the BBB during development, and disruption of these interactions may lead to BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation during CNS injury and disease.

## METHODS SUMMARY
Rodent tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 10% trichloroacetic acid or 95% ethanol followed by acetone. Tissue sections were blocked with 50% goat serum, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Slides were mounted in vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

Anaesthetized rodents were given a trans-cardiac perfusion, with a Dynamax peristaltic pump, of DPBS (Gibco) containing EZ-link sulfo NHS Biotin (Pierce) or biotinylated fixable dextrans (Invitrogen), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue cryosections were stained with streptavidin Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) and analysed by fluorescence microscopy.

CNS endothelial cells were purified by anti-CD31 immunopanning and CNS pericytes were purified by anti-PDGFR-β immunopanning. For immunofluorescence analysis, CNS endothelial cells were grown on coverslips alone, or with a feeder layer of CNS pericytes grown on cell culture inserts. For TEER measurements, CNS endothelial cells were grown on cell culture inserts alone, or with a pericyte feeder layer grown in the culture well bottom beneath, and resistance measurements were recorded with an EVOM voltmeter.

E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for electron microscopy. To image tracer permeability, E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls were given a trans-cardiac perfusion of DPBS (Gibco) containing EZ-link sulfo NHS Biotin (Pierce) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and frozen tissue sections were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde then stained with a HRP-tagged streptavidin (Invitrogen) followed by DAB reaction.

## METHODS
Sprague–Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River. Mice harbouring Pdgfrb − and Pdgfrb F7 alleles were obtained from Phillippe Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), and lines were maintained by breeding with C57BL/6 mice.

For time course experiments, whole rat and mouse embryos before E15, and dissected brains of embryos between E15 and birth, were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Postnatal rats and mice were anaesthetized with a ketamine (100 mg kg −1 )/xylazine (20 mg kg −1 ) cocktail, and perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde with a dynamax peristaltic pump and then dissected brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Staining was performed as described previously 27 , with antibodies directed against PDGFR-β (R&D systems, eBiosciences) and Ng2 (Chemicon) for pericytes, PDGFR-α for OPCs (Abcam), Aqp4 for astrocytes (sigma),Glut1 (Chemicon), Pgp (Sigma) and Icam1 (Abcam), and with appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies and counter-stained with BSL-fluorescein (Vector Labs). For ZO-1 and Plvap immunofluoresence, embryos were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h on ice, before cryopreservation and staining with anti-ZO-1 antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-Plvap antibody (AbD Serotec). Staining for occludin and claudin 5 was achieved by flash freezing dissected brains, or whole embryos for ages less than E15, in OCT. Tissue cryosections were obtained and fixed in cold 95% ethanol for 30 min, followed by 1 min in room temperature acetone. Sections were then rehydrated in PBS, blocked in 50% goat serum and stained with antibodies directed against occludin (Invitrogen), and claudin 5 (Invitrogen), followed by appropriate Alexa-fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with BSL-fluorescein (Vector Labs). Slides were mounted in vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

For pericyte-deficient mice, Pdgfrb −/− and littermate control embryos were flash-frozen and stained using the ethanol/acetone fixation described above with antibodies directed against occludin (Invitrogen), claudin 5 (Invitrogen) and Plvap (AbD Serotec). For Icam1, Ng2 and Glut1 staining, brains of dissected Pdgfrb −/− and littermate control embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and stained as described previously, with antibodies directed against Icam1 (Abcam), Ng2 (Chemicon) or Glut1 (Chemicon). For Gr1 staining, 5-week-old Pdgfrb F7/F7 and littermate controls were perfusion fixed, and dissected brains were further fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and stained as described previously, with antibodies directed against Gr1 (gift from I. Weismann). For comparisons of Pdgfrb −/− and littermate control brains, sections were analysed on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and images were taken with a Diagnostics Instrument SPOT camera with set exposure to appropriately compare staining between genotypes. Percent length of vasculature with intense Icam1 staining was measured using ImageJ ( n ≥ 4 each for mutant and littermate controls for each stain). For pericyte staining comparing Pdgfrb +/+ , Pdgfrb +/− and Pdgfrb −/− mice, tissue sections were stained with anti-Zic1 (Novus) and anti-desmin antibody (Dako) after antigen retrieval by steaming in a 10 mM citrate buffer for 30 min, or anti-NG2 (Chemicon). For quantification of pericyte number in Pdgfrb +/+ and Pdgfrb +/− mice the number of Zic + nuclei was counted and divided by vascular length quantified in ImageJ ( n ≥ 7 for each genotype). Pericyte coverage was quantified using ImageJ to measure the length of BSL + vessels associated with desmin + pericyte processes ( n ≥ 5 for each genotype). Total Gr1 + cells outside BSL + vessels per medial sagittal brain section were counted ( n = 4 each for Pdgfrb F7/F7 and littermate controls). For desmin staining, neonatal Pdgfrb F7/N , Pdgfrb F7/F7 and littermate controls were perfusion-fixed and stained with anti-desmin antibody (Dako) after antigen retrieval by steaming in a 10 mM citrate buffer for 30 min. Pericyte coverage was quantified using ImageJ to measure the length of BSL + vessels associated with desmin + pericyte processes ( n ≥ 3 for each genotype). All quantification was performed blind to genotype.

Animals were anaesthetized with a ketamine (100 mg kg −1 )/xylazine (20 mg kg −1 ) cocktail, and then the thoracic cavity was opened to reveal the heart. The right ventricle was severed and then a DPBS (Gibco) solution containing 1 mg ml −1 EZ-link sulfo NHS-biotin (Pierce) was perfused into the left ventricle using a Dynamax peristaltic pump for 3 min, followed by 5 min of perfusion with 4%paraformaldehyde.The flow rate of the pump was adjusted to match the cardiac output of the rats or mice. Tissues, including the brain, liver and muscle, were dissected and further submersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, before being submerged in 30% sucrose. Ten micrometre cryosections were generated after the tissue was frozen in a 2:1 30% sucrose: OCT mixture. For E15 time points, the entire embryo was submersion-fixed and processed. Tissue sections were treated with a 50% goat serum blocking solution, before staining with streptavidin-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). Staining of streptavidin was analysed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and images were taken with a Diagnostics Instrument SPOT camera and analysed by SPOT software. For comparisons of Pdgfrb −/− and littermate control brains, pregnant mice were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and embryos were extracted and chosen blind to genotype for perfusions. Six embryos were chosen from each litter, one as a control perfused without tracer. The perfusion setup was standardized to minimize fluctuations for pH (7.09 ± 0.005 s.d.) and pO 2 (136.1 mm Hg ± 2.0 s.d.) and the perfusion pressure was maintained digitally with the dynamax pump. The heart beat was monitored and all embryos maintained heart beat throughout tracer perfusions. Perfusions were performed with EZ-link sulfo NHS-biotin (0.5 mg ml −1 , Pierce), 3 kDa biotinylated fixable dextran (0.15 mg ml −1 , Invitrogen) or 70 kDa biotinylated fixable dextran (3.5 mg ml −1 Invitrogen), and micrographs were taken with set exposure to appropriately compare the amount of biotin in the brain tissue. The concentrations of the dextrans were matched for molar concentrations ( n ≥ 6 for each sample group for each tracer). Fluorescence in tissue sections was compared by ImageJ software, using tissue sections of embryos perfused with DPBS without tracer as a background control. Pdgfrb +/+ and Pdgfrb +/− mice were combined as littermate controls, as we did not observe any difference in leakage between the two genotypes. For Evan’s blue extravasation assays, P5 Pdgfrb F7− , Pdgfrb F7/F7 and littermate controls were given an intraperitoneal injection of 10 µl 2% Evan’s blue. After 1 day, animals were perfused as described above with PBS followed by paraformaldehyde. Dissected brains were photographed. For quantification of biotin leakage in neonatal Pdgfrb +/+ and Pdgfrb +/− mice, and in neonatal Pdgfrb F7/− , Pdgfrb F7/F7 and littermate controls, trans-cardiac perfusion of biotin tracer was performed, followed by staining of tissue sections with streptavidin, and quantification of leakage with ImageJ. In each case, perfusions and analysis was done blind to genotype.

Cerebral cortex from E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer overnight at 4 °C and processed for electron microscopy as described previously 31 ( n = 3 for both mutant and littermate controls). To visualize tracer permeability by electron microscopy, E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls were perfused with biotin followed by paraformaldehyde as described above. Frozen tissue sections were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer overnight and stained with aHRP-tagged streptavidin (Invitrogen) followed by DAB reaction before being processed for electron microscopy.

Endothelial cells from adult C57BL/6 mice brains were purified and cultured as previously described 27 and grown with puromycin for the first 3 days. For mouse and rat brain pericytes, brain tissue suspensions were prepared as described previously27, and cell suspensions were incubated on two dishes coated with an anti-CD45 antibody to deplete microglia cells, followed by a dish coated with anti-PDGFR-β to select pericytes. The pericytes were recovered by trypsin treatment and plated on PDL-coated cell culture filter inserts in a DMEM-based medium (Invitrogen) containing SATO, insulin, pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). After 2.5 weeks, pericyte growth media was exchanged for endothelial growth media, and pericyte inserts were added to endothelial cells for 3 days. Endothelial cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, then block/permeabilized for 30 min in 50% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with primary antibodies directed against occludin (Invitrogen), claudin 5 (Invitrogen), Icam1 (Abcam) or Angpt2 (Abcam) and appropriate Alexa-fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, mounted in vectashield with DAPI and images were taken with a Diagnostics Instrument SPOT camera analysed using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Percent vascular length with closed tight junctions was analysed using ImageJ software. Specifically, total length of cell junctions between two cells was measured, and then the length of these junctions where a single band of occludin or claudin 5 (sealed-staining between arrows in Fig. 3H , right panel) or two bands with diffuse staining between (unsealed-staining between arrows in Fig. 3G , right panel) was measured ( n ≥ 3 paired cultures of endothelial cells alone and endothelial cells with pericyte feeder layer for each marker). For TEER measurements, endothelial cells were isolated as described and grown on the filter membrane of Costar HTS transwell plates, and cultured in puromycin for 3 days, before being transferred to a new dish with media containing hydrocortisone, without puromycin. In the new dish, half the filter membranes were placed in wells with pericytes cultured on the bottom well. Resistance measurements were taken between 10–19 days after co-culture with an EVOM voltmeter (World Precision Instruments) and subtracted from resistance of membrane without cellular culture. Unit resistance was calculated by multiplying the resistance by the area of the filter membrane, and averaged for each sample ( n = 6 paired cultures of endothelial cells alone and endothelial cells with pericyte feeder layer).

Vascular cells from E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls were purified based on methods described previously 27 . Acutely purified pericytes were purified from mouse brain by anti-PDGFR-β immunopanning as described. Purification of RNA from acutely isolated cells, generation of biotinylated cRNA, subsequent hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays and raw image analysis with Affymetrix GCOS 1.3 software was performed as previously described 32 .

Cerebral cortex from E18 Pdgfrb −/− and littermate controls were homogenized and re-suspended and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1%Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), and protein concentration was quantified using BCA protein assay (Pierce). Samples were analysed by SDS–PAGE as previously described 33 . Briefly, samples were resolved on SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk solution and then incubated with antibodies directed against occludin (Invitrogen), claudin 5 (Invitrogen), Icam1 (Abcam), Alcam(R&D Systems), Lgals3 (R&D Systems), Col I (Abcam), Col III (Abcam), vitronectin (Abcam), MMP9 (Abcam), PDGFR-β (eBiosciences) or β-actin (Sigma) followed by incubation with an appropriate secondary conjugated to HRP (Jackson 1:10,000) and visualized using a chemiluminescent ECL substrate for HRP (GE), and either exposed on film and quantified with ImageJ or imaged with a Fuji-Film LAS 4000 and analysed with Multi Gauge V3.0 software ( n = 2–5 for mutant and n = 4–8 for littermate controls).
