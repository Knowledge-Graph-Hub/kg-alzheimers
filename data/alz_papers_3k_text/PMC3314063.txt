Ablation of Cellular Prion Protein Does Not Ameliorate Abnormal Neural Network Activity or Cognitive Dysfunction in the J20 Line of Human Amyloid Precursor Protein Transgenic Mice

# Abstract
Previous studies suggested that the cellular prion protein (PrP c ) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers were proposed to cause synaptic and cognitive dysfunction by binding to PrP c . To test this hypothesis, we crossed human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice from line J20 onto a PrP c -deficient background. Ablation of PrP c did not prevent the premature mortality and abnormal neural network activity typically seen in hAPPJ20 mice. Furthermore, hAPPJ20 mice with or without PrP c expression showed comparably robust abnormalities in learning and memory and in other
behavioral domains at 6–8 months of age. Notably, these abnormalities are not refractory to therapeutic manipulations in general: they can be effectively prevented by interventions that prevent Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction also in other lines of hAPP transgenic mice. Thus, at least in this model, PrP c is not an important mediator of Aβ-induced neurological impairments.

## Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects many millions of people and is on the rise worldwide ( Thies and Bleiler, 2011 ). Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, released from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), are implicated in its pathogenesis. At high concentrations, Aβ peptides form diverse assemblies, among which Aβ oligomers may be the most pathogenic ( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Shankar et al., 2008 ; Ashe and Zahs, 2010 ; Sakono and Zako, 2010 ). One of the most important unresolved questions is whether Aβ oligomers impair neuronal functions by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. Aβ oligomers bind a variety of receptors, including the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) ( Origlia et al., 2009 ), α-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( Dineley et al., 2002 ), cellular prion protein (PrP c ) ( Lauren et al., 2009 ; Balducci et al., 2010 ), and Ephrin-type B2 receptor (EphB2) ( Renner et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ). Determining which interaction most affects cognitive functions is an important objective.

PrP c was reported to mediate Aβ-induced deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairments ( Lauren et al., 2009 ; Gimbel et al., 2010 ). This membrane-anchored glycoprotein helps to maintain the brain's white matter and regulate its innate immune cells, responses to oxidative stress, and neurogenesis ( Aguzzi et al., 2008 ). PrP c ablation prevented deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) elicited by Aβ oligomers in acute hippocampal slices ( Lauren et al., 2009 ) and behavioral impairments in APPswe/PSenΔE9 transgenic mice ( Gimbel et al., 2010 ). However, others could not reproduce the electrophysiological rescue ( Calella et al., 2010 ; Kessels et al., 2010 ), and one study reported that acute intracerebroventricular injection of synthetic Aβ oligomers caused similar deficits in learning and memory in mice with or without PrP c expression ( Balducci et al., 2010 ).

Because the experimental design used in the latter study differs from the chronic exposure to Aβ oligomers neurons experience in human APP (hAPP) transgenic mice and in AD, we set out to replicate the reported rescue of behavioral functions ( Gimbel et al., 2010 ) in hAPPJ20 mice. hAPPJ20 mice have a robust phenotype with a range of AD-like alterations, including deficits in spatial and nonspatial learning and memory, behavioral abnormalities, synaptic impairments, changes in various synaptic activity-related proteins, amyloid plaques, dystrophic neurites, aberrant sprouting of axon terminals, astrocytosis, and microgliosis ( Mucke et al., 2000 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ; Palop et al., 2007 ; Roberson et al., 2007 ; Meilandt et al., 2008 ; Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). We crossed hAPPJ20 mice onto a PrP c -deficient background and compared hAPPJ20 mice with or without PrP c expression at 6–8 months of age in a battery of behavioral tests and by video-EEG monitoring.

## Materials and Methods
Hemizygous transgenic and NTG mice were from line J20, which expresses an alternatively spliced hAPPJ20 minigene encoding hAPP695, hAPP751 and hAPP770 with the Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations directed by the PDGFβ-chain promoter ( Rockenstein et al., 1995 ; Mucke et al., 2000 ). PrP c -deficient Prnp knockout mice (B6.129S7-Prnp tm1Cwe /Orl) were acquired from the European Mutant Mouse Archive. hAPP mice and Prnp −/− mice were on a C57Bl/6J background. Mice had access to food (Picolab Rodent Diet 20, Labdiet) and water ad libitum . For all experiments, groups were sex-balanced.

For Aβ measurements, snap-frozen hippocampal samples were homogenized in 5 M guanidine buffer. Aβ1– x and Aβ1–42 were quantified by ELISA as described ( Johnson-Wood et al., 1997 ; Mucke et al., 2000 ). Total hAPP and C99 levels in hippocampal samples were assessed by western blotting as described ( Harris et al., 2010 ). The following antibodies were used: anti-hAPP (1:1000; 8E5; kindly provided by Elan Pharmaceuticals), anti-CTF (CT-15, 1:1000, kindly provided by Dr. Eddy Koo, University of California at San Diego) and anti-tubulin (Sigma).

The elevated plus maze has two open (without walls) and two enclosed (with walls) arms elevated 63 cm above the ground (Hamilton-Kinder, Poway, CA). Mice were acclimated to the testing room under dim light for 1 h and tested as described ( Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ).

Spontaneous locomotor activity in an open field was measured as described ( Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ).

Mice were acclimated in the testing room for at least 1 h before testing. Testing was performed as described ( Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ) and frequency of object interactions and time spent exploring each object were recorded with a video tracking system (Noldus) for analysis.

The apparatus and training protocol have been described ( Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ).

Mice were implanted for video-EEG monitoring after anesthesia with avertin (tribromoethanol, 250 mg/kg, i.p.). Teflon-coated silver wire electrodes (0.125-mm diameter) soldered to a multichannel electrical connector were implanted into the subdural space over the left frontal cortex (coordinates relative to the bregma were M/L, ±1 mm; A/P, ±1 mm) and the left and right parietal cortex (M/L, ±2 mm, A/P, ±2 mm). The left frontal cortex electrode was a reference. EEG recordings were carried out at least 7 days after surgery on freely moving mice in a recording chamber. EEG activity was recorded with the Harmonie software (version 5.0b) for 48 h. Epileptic spikes were automatically detected by Gotman spike and seizure detectors (Harmonie) and confirmed by inspection of EEG recordings.

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism. Differences between two means were assessed by paired or unpaired t test. Differences among multiple means were assessed, as indicated, by one-way, two-way or repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s or Tukey’s post-hoc test. Error bars represent s.e.m. Differences between observed and expected values were assessed by one- or two-sided Chi-square test. Null hypotheses were rejected at the 0.05 level.

## Results
Like other hAPP transgenic models, hAPPJ20 mice display a disinhibition-like phenotype in the elevated plus maze and hyperactivity in arenas, such as the open field ( Chin et al., 2005 ; Kobayashi and Chen, 2005 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ; Roberson et al., 2007 ; Meilandt et al., 2009 ; Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ). To determine if PrP c ablation prevents behavioral abnormalities, we generated hAPPJ20 mice with ( Prnp +/+ ) or without ( Prnp −/− ) PrP c and compared them in these paradigms at 6–8 months, when behavioral abnormalities are readily detectable in hAPPJ20 mice on the Prnp +/+ background. hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze than Prnp +/+ and Prnp −/− mice without hAPP ( Fig. 1A ), suggesting disinhibition or lower levels of anxiety. Ablation of PrP c had no effect. It also had no significant effect on the hyperactivity of hAPP mice in the open field (p=0.132 by unpaired, one-tailed Student’s t test) ( Fig. 1B ).

Like other hAPP transgenic mice, hAPPJ20 mice show deficits in spatial and nonspatial learning and memory ( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Roberson et al., 2007 ; Meilandt et al., 2009 ; Harris et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Nonspatial learning and memory were assessed in the novel object recognition test. Unlike mice without hAPP, hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice did not prefer the novel over the familiar object ( Fig. 1C ), suggesting deficits in recognizing or remembering the familiar object. Ablation of PrP c provided no benefit to hAPP mice.

Spatial learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze. PrP c ablation failed to prevent deficits hAPPJ20 mice typically show in this test and even tended to worsen them. In the cued-platform task, all mice learned similarly (data not shown). In the hidden-platform (spatial) version, both hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice showed significant learning deficits compared with Prnp +/+ and Prnp −/− mice lacking hAPP ( Fig. 2A ). hAPP mice without PrP c performed slightly worse than hAPP mice with PrP c (p<0.05 by linear contrast and Bonferroni test). Swim speeds during the hidden platform training were comparable among all groups (data not shown).

At 24 hours after the last training, spatial memory retention was assessed in a probe trial. The platform was removed, and mice were given 60 s to explore the pool. Unlike mice without hAPP, hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice failed to spend significantly more time in the target quadrant (i.e., where the platform was) than in the other quadrants ( Fig. 2B ). hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice also failed to cross the original platform location significantly more often than corresponding locations in non-target quadrants ( Fig. 2C ). Finally, hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice took longer to reach the original platform location than mice without hAPP ( Fig. 2D ). In all three outcome measures, hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice tended to perform worse than hAPP/ Prnp +/+ mice, although these differences did not reach statistical significance.

We compared hippocampal Aβ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA and hippocampal levels of hAPP and hAPP C-terminal fragment C99 (relative levels) by western blots in 8–13-month-old hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice (mean ± s.e.m.): Aβ 1-x (148 ± 23 vs 100 ± 26), Aβ 1–42 (108 ± 16 vs 78 ± 19), Aβ 1–42/Aβ 1-x ratio (0.67 ± 0.08 vs 0.81 ± 0.05), hAPP (4895 ± 498 vs 5007 ± 488), and C99 (8310 ± 1171 vs 6212 ± 989). None of these differences was statistically significant by unpaired t test.

Like other hAPP transgenic lines, hAPPJ20 mice exhibit early mortality, which may be caused by epileptic seizures ( Chin et al., 2004 ; Palop et al., 2007 ; Roberson et al., 2007 ; Meilandt et al., 2009 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Prnp +/+ , Prnp −/− , hAPP/ Prnp +/+ and hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice were born at comparable proportions ( Fig. 3A ). However, from birth to weaning (P27), more hAPP mice tended to die than mice without hAPP, independently of Prnp genotype ( Fig. 3B ).
By 8 months of age, 8% of APP/ Prnp +/+ mice died ( Fig. 3C ). Surprisingly, PrP c ablation worsened early mortality in hAPPJ20 mice, resulting in a 22% death rate in hAPP/ Prnp −/− mice ( Fig. 3C ). During the observation period, only one death occurred in Prnp +/+ or Prnp −/− mice lacking hAPP.

EEG recordings from the neocortex and hippocampus of hAPPJ20 mice revealed spontaneous epileptiform activity ( Palop et al., 2007 ), and similar findings have been obtained in other lines of hAPP mice ( Minkeviciene et al., 2009 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Because Prnp −/− mice were reported as more resistant to proconvulsant drugs than Prnp +/+ mice ( Ratte et al., 2011 ), we examined whether PrP c ablation makes hAPPJ20 mice more resistant to Aβ-induced epileptiform activity. Prnp +/+ and Prnp −/− mice with or without hAPP were compared by 48-h video and EEG recordings at 6–8 months of age. Bilateral recording electrodes over the parietal cortex revealed very few or no spikes in mice without hAPP ( Figure 4A ) and an average of 7 spikes per hour in hAPPJ20/ Prnp +/+ mice ( Figure 4B ). Remarkably, PrP c ablation actually doubled the epileptiform activity recorded in hAPPJ20 mice ( Figure 4B ). No seizures occurred during the recording period in any of the groups.

## Discussion
PrP c ablation did not prevent neuronal network dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities in hAPPJ20 transgenic mice. In fact, it doubled the early mortality rate and epileptiform activity in this line. The resulting selection process and survival of mice with relative resistance against the synergistic effects of hAPP/Aβ overexpression and PrP c ablation might have diminished our ability to detect an exacerbating effect of PrP c ablation on hAPP/Aβ-dependent behavioral abnormalities. Subtle signs of such an effect were evident in the probe trial of the Morris water maze test.

These results differ with studies showing PrP c ablation prevents Aβ-induced LTP deficits in acute hippocampal slices ( Lauren et al., 2009 ) and diminishes early mortality and impairments in spatial learning and memory in APPswe/PSenΔE9 transgenic mice ( Gimbel et al., 2010 ). However, our findings agree with others showing PrP c ablation does not affect Aβ-induced synaptic depression, reduction in spine density and LTP deficits in acute hippocampal slices ( Kessels et al., 2010 ), behavioral impairments from intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ ( Balducci et al., 2010 ), and impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity ( Calella et al., 2010 ).

hAPPJ20 mice and other hAPP lines show epileptiform activity ( Palop and Mucke, 2010 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Genetic manipulations that prevent or counteract aberrant excitatory neuronal activity (e.g., ablation of Fyn, group IVA phospholipase A2 or tau) reduce premature mortality and/or cognitive deficits in hAPP-J20 mice ( Chin et al., 2004 ; Chin et al., 2005 ; Roberson et al., 2007 ; Sanchez-Mejia et al., 2008 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, PrP c has also been implicated in epilepsy ( Walz et al., 2002 ). However, PrP c ablation actually increased premature mortality and did not affect cognitive deficits in hAPPJ20 mice, making it unlikely that it protects against Aβ-induced seizure activity, which is closely linked to cognitive impairments in these mice ( Palop et al., 2007 ; Palop and Mucke, 2010 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Indeed, PrP c ablation enhanced spontaneous epileptiform activity in hAPPJ20 mice, consistent with the increased susceptibility of Prnp −/− mice to kainate-induced seizures ( Walz et al., 1999 ; Rangel et al., 2007 ).

We found PrP c ablation doubled premature mortality in hAPPJ20 mice but had no effect on mice without hAPP, suggesting a specific interaction between hAPP/Aβ- and PrP c -dependent mechanisms. The lower seizure threshold of Prnp −/− mice might partially explain the increased early mortality of hAPPJ20/ Prnp −/− mice. These results are in stark contrast to the increased survival of PrP c -deficient APPswe/PSenΔE9 mice, which were also on the C57Bl/6J background ( Gimbel et al., 2010 ).

The different effects of PrP c ablation on Aβ-induced deficits observed by different investigators might stem from differences in experimental protocols, hAPP lines and Prnp −/− strains. For example, if levels of pathogenic Aβ oligomers in relevant brain regions were higher in hAPPJ20 mice than in APPswe/PSenΔE9 mice, beneficial effects of PrP c ablation in hAPPJ20 mice might have been obscured. However, if PrP c is crucial in Aβ-induced cognitive deficits, its ablation should prevent those deficits in hAPPJ20 mice as ablation of group IVA phospholipase A 2 ( Sanchez-Mejia et al., 2008 ) or tau ( Roberson et al., 2007 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Even partial reduction of these two molecules in hemizygous knockout mice significantly ameliorated the deficits in hAPPJ20 mice ( Roberson et al., 2007 ; Sanchez-Mejia et al., 2008 ; Roberson et al., 2011 ). Thus, Aβ-induced cognitive deficits in hAPPJ20 mice are not so severe that they simply cannot be overcome by any intervention. In fact, neuronal and cognitive dysfunction in these mice could be reversed effectively by normalizing neuronal expression of EphB2, an alternative receptor for Aβ oligomers ( Cisse et al., 2011 ).

Because Aβ binds to many molecules ( Dineley et al., 2002 ; Lauren et al., 2009 ; Origlia et al., 2009 ; Balducci et al., 2010 ; Renner et al., 2010 ; Cisse et al., 2011 ), it is critical to determine which of these interactions have the greatest functional impact. Interactions of Aβ oligomers with the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( Origlia et al., 2009 ) and with EphB2 ( Cisse et al., 2011 ) have striking effects on neuronal and cognitive functions and, we suspect, may be more promising drug targets for AD than PrP c .
