Probing sporadic and familial Alzheimer’s disease using induced pluripotent stem cells

# Abstract
Our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis is currently limited by difficulties in obtaining live neurons from patients and the inability to model the sporadic form of the disease. It may be possible to overcome these challenges by reprogramming primary cells from patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we reprogrammed primary fibroblasts from two patients with familial Alzheimer’s disease, both caused by a duplication of the amyloid-β precursor protein gene 1 ( APP ; termed APP Dp ), two with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (termed sAD1, sAD2) and two non-demented control individuals into iPSC lines. Neurons from differentiated cultures were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized. Purified cultures contained more than 90% neurons, clustered with fetal brain messenger RNA samples by microarray criteria, and could form functional synaptic contacts. Virtually all cells exhibited normal electrophysiological activity. Relative to controls, iPSC-derived, purified neurons from the two APP Dp patients and patient sAD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of the pathological markers amyloid-β(1–40), phospho-tau(Thr 231) and active glycogen synthase kinase-3β (aGSK-3β). Neurons from APP Dp and sAD2 patients also accumulated large RAB5-positive early endosomes compared to controls. Treatment of purified neurons with β-secretase inhibitors, but not γ-secretase inhibitors, caused significant reductions in phospho-Tau(Thr 231) and aGSK-3β levels. These results suggest a direct relationship between APP proteolytic processing, but not amyloid-β, in GSK-3β activation and tau phosphorylation in human neurons. Additionally, we observed that neurons with the genome of one sAD patient exhibited the phenotypes seen in familial Alzheimer’s disease samples. More generally, we demonstrate that iPSC technology can be used to observe phenotypes relevant to Alzheimer’s disease, even though it can take decades for overt disease to manifest in patients.

## METHODS SUMMARY
Primary fibroblast cultures were established from dermal punch biopsies taken from individuals following informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval. To generate iPSCs, fibroblasts were transduced with MMLV vectors containing the complementary DNAs for OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , c-MYC and ± EGFP . IPSC-derived NPCs were differentiated for 3 weeks, neurons were purified by FACS, and amyloid-β, p-tau/total tau and aGSK-3β were measured on purified control and mutant neurons from multiple lines cultured in parallel for an additional 5 days by multi-spot electrochemiluminescence assays (Meso Scale Diagnostics). Early endosomes were analysed by confocal microscopy on purified neurons co-cultured with human astrocytes (Lonza) for 12 days. To ensure reproducible and consistent data, we found that it is important to differentiate and evaluate neurons from full sets of mutant and control iPSC lines together.

P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Individuals were statistically compared to the total NDC pool by Tukey’s test. Drug responses were compared to controls by Dunnett’s method. N values signify the total number of separate cultures analysed, with each iPSC line contributing equally to the total.
