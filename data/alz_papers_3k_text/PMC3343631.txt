Galectin-8 targets damaged vesicles for autophagy to defend cells against bacterial invasion

# Abstract
Autophagy defends the mammalian cytosol against bacterial infection. 1 - 3 Efficient pathogen engulfment is mediated by cargo-selecting autophagy adaptors that rely on unidentified pattern-recognition or danger receptors to label invading pathogens as autophagy cargo, typically by poly-ubiquitin coating. 4 - 9 Here we show that galectin-8, a cytosolic lectin, is a danger receptor that restricts Salmonella proliferation. Galectin-8 monitors endo-lysosomal integrity and detects bacterial invasion by binding host glycans exposed on damaged Salmonella -containing vacuoles. By recruiting NDP52 galectin-8 activates anti-bacterial autophagy. Galectin-8-dependent recruitment of NDP52 to Salmonella -containing vesicles is transient and followed by ubiquitin-dependent NDP52 recruitment. Since galectin-8 also detects sterile damage to endosomes or lysosomes, as well as invasion by Listeria or Shigella , we suggest galectin-8 serves as a versatile receptor for vesicle-damaging pathogens. Our results illustrate how cells deploy the danger receptor galectin-8 to combat infection by monitoring endo-lysososomal integrity based on the specific lack of complex carbohydrates in the cytosol.
