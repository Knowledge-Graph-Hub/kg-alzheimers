Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors

# Abstract
In the developing central nervous system (CNS), the control of synapse number and function is critical to the formation of neural circuits. We previously demonstrated that astrocyte-secreted factors powerfully induce the formation of functional excitatory synapses between CNS neurons 1 . Astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins induce structural synapses, however these synapses are post-synaptically silent 2 . Here we use biochemical fractionation of astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) to identify glypican 4 (Gpc4) and 6 (Gpc6) as astrocyte-secreted signals sufficient to induce functional synapses between purified retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons, and show that depletion of these molecules from ACM significantly reduces its ability to induce postsynaptic activity. Application of Gpc4 to purified neurons is sufficient to increase the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic synaptic events. This is achieved by increasing the surface level and clustering, but not overall cellular protein level, of the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor (AMPAR). Gpc4&6 are expressed by astrocytes in vivo in the developing CNS, with Gpc4 expression enriched in the hippocampus and Gpc6 in the cerebellum. Finally, we demonstrate that Gpc4-deficient mice have defective synapse formation, with decreased amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents in the developing hippocampus and reduced recruitment of AMPARs to synapses. These data identify glypicans as a family of novel astrocyte-derived molecules that are necessary and sufficient to promote glutamate receptor clustering and receptivity and induce the formation of post-synaptically functioning CNS synapses.

## Methods and materials
Step-by-step protocols for all procedures are available on request to nallen@salk.edu .

RGCs were purified by sequential immunopanning to greater than 99% purity from P5-P7 Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles Rivers) and cultured in serum-free medium containing BDNF, CNTF, and forskolin on laminin-coated coverslips at 50,000 cells/well, as previously described 1 , 2 . Cortical astrocytes (MD astrocytes) were prepared as described in 1 . In some experiments astrocytes were prepared by immunopanning (IP astrocytes), as recently described in 5 . RCGs were cultured for 7–10 days to allow robust process outgrowth and then cultured with astrocyte inserts, ACM, Cos7 conditioned media, thrombospondin or glypican 4/6 for an additional 6 days unless stated otherwise.

RGC transfection with siRNA, along with GFP to mark transfected cells, was carried out using Lipofectamine as described in 28 . OnTarget Plus siRNA pool against GluA1 was from Dharmacon (catalogue number L-097755-01). In companion control experiments RGCs were transfected with the same amount of either a targeting control (siCyclophilin B) or a non-targeting control (siControl) pool from Dharmacon; results obtained were the same with both.

Glypican 4 KO mice were obtained from Genentech/Lexicon, and were generated by homologous recombination targeting exon 3, confirmed by Southern blotting 24 . No glypican 4 protein was detected by Western blotting conditioned media prepared from glypican 4 KO astrocytes, demonstrating no functional protein was being secreted ( Fig S5C ). Mice were maintained on a mixed genetic background (129/C57bl6/J), as they became less viable when crossed onto a pure C57Bl6/J background (unpublished observations). All experiments were carried out using male WT and KO littermates (glypican 4 is on the X chromosome, so experiments compared Gpc4+/y with Gpc4−/y). In order to trace dendrites Gpc4 KO mice were crossed to Thy1-GFP-M mice obtained from JAX.

Cortical astrocytes were cultured in 15cm plates in serum-containing medium until confluent. Cells were then washed 3x with warm DPBS to remove serum, and placed in minimal conditioning medium for 4 days. Conditioning media contained phenol red-free neurobasal, glutamine, pyruvate, penicillin and streptomycin. Astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) was collected and first centrifuged to pellet dead cells and debris, then placed in centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius) with a size cut-off filter of 5kDa unless otherwise stated. ACM was concentrated 50-fold. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and ACM was fed to RGCs at 50–80μg/ml. This method gave ACM that induced synaptic activity when fed to RGCs the majority of the time, as long as astrocytes were used soon after isolation and not passaged extensively.

For siRNA experiments, OnTarget Plus siRNA pools against rat glypican 4 (catalogue number L-098055-01) and glypican 6 (catalogue number L-106892-01) were obtained from Dharmacon. Following validation individual siRNAs against glypican 4 (sequence 9) and glypican 6 (sequence 6) were selected and used in all experiments ( Fig S6 ). In companion control experiments astrocytes were transfected with the same amount of either a targeting control (siCyclophilin B) or a non-targeting control (siControl) pool from Dharmacon; results obtained were the same with both. In rescue experiments astrocytes were cotransfected with cDNA for human glypican 4 which is resistant to the siRNA. Confluent astrocytes were put into single cell suspension using trypsin and Amaxa nucleofection was used to introduce siRNA into the astrocytes. Astrocytes were plated into RGC growth medium minus B27 and growth factors for 24 hours to recover from the transfection and to allow for knockdown of the proteins of interest. Astrocytes were then washed 3x with warm DPBS and placed in minimal conditioning medium for 3 days, before collection of ACM as outlined above. Comparable results were seen when Lipofectamine was used to introduce siRNA to astrocytes, rather than nucleofection (data not shown). Knockdown of glypican 4 and 6 was validated by Western blotting of ACM for glypican 4 (Proteintech rabbit anti-glypican 4) and glypican 6 (RandD goat anti-glypican 6). RGCs were fed with equal amounts of protein from control and siGlypican4+6 ACM, between 30–40ug/ml. ACM was fed to RGCs in a range that was at the low end of the effective dose for control ACM, so that the effect of reducing the levels of glypican 4 and 6 in ACM could be observed. This was necessary due to incomplete knockdown of glypican 4 and 6 in astrocytes, so the levels present in ACM were reduced rather than eliminated.

ACM was concentrated as outlined above, then loaded onto an IPG strip pH 3–10 and first separated by isoelectric point followed by separation by mass on an SDS gel following manufacturers’ instructions (Biorad). The separated proteins were visualized using Silver staining following manufacturers’ instructions (Invitrogen).

ACM was prepared as outlined above and diluted into column loading buffer appropriate for each column. Columns were pre-packed and 1ml size (GE Healthcare), and fractionation procedures were carried out at RT in a tissue culture hood to keep the ACM sterile, and using a syringe to apply manual pressure. 20mM ethanolamine pH9.5 was used as the buffer in all experiments. Initially each column was tested in isolation and then combined in series in the following procedure ( Fig S3 ). 3.3mg ACM, collected from 10×15cm plates of astrocytes, was diluted in ethanolamine buffer and passed over a heparin column to which the protein of interest did not bind. The unbound fraction was collected and passed over an anion column (Q column), to which the protein of interest did bind. The NaCl (salt) concentration was increased to 0.5M to remove irrelevant proteins, then to 2M to elute proteins of interest. The 0.5–2M anion column eluate was passed over a hydrophobic interaction column (phenyl low sub), to which the protein of interest did bind. The bound proteins were eluted by decreasing the NaCl from 2M to 0M. This final eluate contained 32μg protein ( Table S1 ), and was 6-fold enriched for functional activity, and was analysed by mass spectrometry. Column fractions were tested by feeding to RGCs at known protein concentrations, in the presence of thrombospondin to induce structural synapses, followed by electrophysiological recording of total synaptic activity. Before feeding to RGCs the column fractions went through a buffer exchange from ethanolamine buffer to neurobasal, to remove high levels of salt. Pierce Zeba desalt spin columns were used for buffer exchange following manufacturers’ instructions.

Both the positive fraction (phenyl column eluate) and negative fraction (phenyl column unbound fraction) were analysed for comparison. Proteins were analysed in solution, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide, followed by digestion with trypsin. The liquid peptide mixture was passed over an HPLC column to separate individual peptides, which were then spotted onto a MALDI plate. Individual spots on the MALDI plate were analysed using MS/MS on an Applied Biosystems machine. Peptides were identified using the manufacturers’ software and the NCBI database

Expression constructs for the majority of the proteins identified from the column fractionation procedure were obtained from Open Biosystems or Origene. The identity of the cDNA was verified by sequencing before use. Cos7 cells were used as a ‘negative cell-line’ in which to express candidates, as Cos7 cell conditioned media (CM) induced little synaptic activity in RGCs ( Fig S4 ). Cos7 cells were transfected with cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers’ instructions. 3 hours after transfection cells were washed 3x with warm DPBS and placed into minimal conditioning media for 3 days, and conditioned media was collected as described for ACM. Cos7 CM was fed to RGCs in the presence of thrombospondin in order to induce structural synapse formation.

Full length cDNA for glypican 4 (rat cDNA from Open Biosystems, clone # 7124728) or glypican 6 (mouse cDNA from Open Biosystems, clone # 5008374) with a 6-histidine tag at the N-terminus were cloned into pAPtag5 vector (GenHunter) between the SfiI and XhoI sites. These were expressed in HEK293 cells or astrocytes, which were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The secreted recombinant protein was then purified from conditioned culture media by Ni-chelating chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The purity of the protein was assessed by running a sample on an SDS gel and staining with coomassie blue (Pierce). Protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay and Western blotting for glypican 4 (rabbit anti-glypican 4, Proteintech) or glypican 6 (goat anti-glypican 6, RandD) and the 6-histidine tag (mouse anti-histidine, Abcam), and glypican 4 and 6 were fed to neurons at concentrations between 0.1–10nM. Purified human platelet TSP1 was obtained from Haematologic Technologies and fed to neurons at 5ug/ml. For testing candidate glypican 4 interactors recombinant proteins were purchased and fed at the concentrations indicated in the figure legend.

Glycosylation-deficient glypican 4 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis against the presumed glycosylation attachment sites, as in 29 . Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and by the loss of high MW smearing when the purified protein was run on a Western blot.

For synapse quantification of RGC cultures cells were fixed for 7 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and blocked in 200 μl of a blocking buffer containing 50% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. After blocking, coverslips were washed three times in PBS, and 200 μL of primary antibody solution was added to each coverslip, consisting of mouse anti-bassoon (1:500, Stressgen) and postsynaptic antibody against all isoforms of homer (1:1000, Chemicon). Coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with 200 μl of Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted 1:1000 in antibody buffer. Following incubation for 2 hours, coverslips were washed 3–4 times in PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc) on glass slides (VWR Scientific). Secondary-only controls were routinely performed and revealed no significant background staining. Mounted coverslips were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon). Healthy cells that were at least two cell diameters from their nearest neighbours were identified and selected at random by eye using DAPI fluorescence. Eight bit digital images of the fluorescence emission at both 594 nm and 488 nm were recorded for each selected cell using a monochrome CCD camera and SPOT image capture software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc). Set exposures were used for each experiment, and were calculated from the positive control condition (RGC + astrocyte). Merged images were analyzed for co-localized puncta by using a custom plug-in (written by Barry Wark, available upon request from nallen@salk.edu ) for the NIH image processing package ImageJ. In each experiment 15–30 cells across 3 coverslips were imaged per condition. Graphs are averages of values obtained from multiple experiments, as detailed in the legend, and are normalised to the RGC alone condition.

Rabbit anti-GluA1 (Calbiochem), an antibody recognising the extracellular region of GluA1, was added to the cell culture medium for 15mins at 37C at 5ug/ml to label surface AMPA receptors. Cell Tracker Red CMPTX dye (Invitrogen) was added at 0.5μM during the incubation in order to label the whole cell. Cells were washed 3x with DPBS to remove unbound antibody, fixed for 5 minutes in 4% PFA (the short fixation time prevents permeabilisation of the cell), washed 3x with PBS and blocked in 50% goat serum for 30 minutes at room temperature. After blocking cells were washed 3x with PBS and incubated in goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody 1/500 for 1 hour at RT. Coverslips were washed 3–4 times in PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc) on glass slides (VWR Scientific). Secondary-only controls were routinely performed and revealed no significant background staining. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against intracellular proteins gave no staining using this method.

Mounted coverslips were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon). Healthy cells that were at least two cell diameters from their nearest neighbours were identified at random using the Cell Tracker Red channel. 8 bit digital images of the fluorescence emission at both 594 nm and 488 nm were recorded for each selected cell using a monochrome CCD camera and SPOT image capture software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc). Set exposures were used for each experiment, and were calculated from the positive control condition (RGC + astrocyte). Number of puncta per cell were analysed using the Integrated Morphometry application in Metamorph. In each experiment 15–30 cells across 3 coverslips were imaged per condition. Graphs are averages of values obtained from multiple experiments, as detailed in the legend, and are normalised to the RGC alone condition.

For surface biotinylation of RGCs, cells were plated in 35mm wells at 250,000 cells/well, and 2–3 wells were pooled per condition. Biotinylation was performed using Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit with the following modifications. All steps were performed at 4C unless otherwise stated. Cells were placed on ice and washed 2x with DPBS, then biotin at 0.25mg/ml in DPBS was added for 20 minutes at 4C to label surface proteins. Cells were washed 3x with TBS to remove unbound biotin, and lysed in RIPA buffer. RIPA buffer was added to the well for 5 minutes, cells were removed by squirting and collected in an eppendorf tube, and rotated for 1 hour to fully solubilise membranes. Tubes were then spun at 13,000rpm for 15 minutes to pellet unsolubilised material and the supernatant was collected. A sample was collected at this stage to analyse for total protein levels. The remainder of the solubilised proteins were mixed with streptavidin-conjugated beads overnight to isolate the biotinylated proteins. Unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation, and bound biotinylated proteins were collected by incubating the beads in SDS-buffer+DTT for 1 hour at RT.

Both total RGC lysate proteins and surface RGC proteins were separated by size on 4–15% gradient SDS gels (Biorad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 hour at RT, washed 3x in PBS-Tween and incubated overnight at 4C in primary antibodies: mouse anti-beta actin 1/5000 (Sigma), rabbit anti-neuron specific enolase 1/1000 (Polyscience), rabbit anti-GluA1 0.25μg/ml (Millipore), rabbit anti-GluA2 0.25μg/ml (Millipore), rabbit anti-GluA2/3 2.5μg/ml (Millipore), rabbit anti-GluA4 1/1000 (Millipore). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:5000) were used as secondary antibodies (Millipore) and the detection was performed with an ECL-plus kit from Amersham. Signals were acquired using a QImager CCD system and analysed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Band intensity was normalised to the control (RGC alone) condition in each experiment, and data are presented normalised to RGC alone.

Hippocampi were dissected out in ice-cold PBS, then each hippocampus was homogenised in 250ul RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Pierce). Lysates were solubilised for one hour at 4C, spun down to remove unsolubilised material, aliquoted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80C until use. Protein values were determined by BCA assay and were typically 5ug/ul. For each sample 5ug of protein was loaded onto the gel. Blots were probed with antibodies as indicated in the figure legend, and values were normalised to the beta-tubulin loading control for each sample.

Total synaptic activity and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded by whole-cell patch clamping RGCs at room temperature (18°C–22°C) at a holding potential of −70 mV. The extracellular solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 1 NaH2PO4 and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), plus TTX (1 μM) when mEPSCs were being recorded. Patch pipettes were 3–5 MΩ and the internal solution contained (in mM) 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). mEPSCs were recorded using pClamp software for Windows (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and were analyzed using Mini Analysis Program (SynaptoSoft, Decatur, GA). Results from at least 4 separate experiments were pooled for analysis.

Experiments were carried out on littermate WT and Gpc4 KO mice aged P12–P14 and P21–P25, and recordings and analysis were both carried out blind to genotype. A chilled choline-based cutting solution was used for dissection and slicing containing (in mM): NaCl 78.3, NaHCO 3 23, glucose 23, choline chloride 33.8, KCl 2.3, NaH 2 PO 4 1.1, MgCl 2 6.4, and CaCl 2 0.45, pH 7.4. Parasagittal brain slices at 250μm containing the hippocampus were cut on a Leica vibratome. Slices were allowed to recover at 31°C for 25 min in the choline cutting solution and for 30 min in isotonic saline solution (in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO 3 25, glucose 25, KCl 2.5, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, MgCl 2 2, and CaCl 2 2.5, pH 7.4). Oxygenation (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) was continuously supplied during cutting, recovery and recording. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were performed. Patch pipettes with resistance of 2–4MOhm were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with an internal solution containing (mM) CsMeSO 3 130 (Cs+ was used as the main cation rather than K+ to improve voltage uniformity), NaCl 4, HEPES 10, EGTA 5, CaCl 2 0.5, MgATP 4, Na 2 GTP 0.5, QX-314 5 (to suppress voltage-gated sodium currents), pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Access resistance was monitored throughout the recording and was <20MOhm. Recordings were carried out at room temperature in flowing isotonic saline containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin to block voltage-gated sodium channels, the GABA A receptor antagonist 40 μM bicuculline, and 25μM D-AP5 to block NMDA receptors in order to isolate AMPA-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). In control experiments all events were eliminated by application of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX. mEPSCs were recorded for five minutes and analysed using Minianalysis Synaptosoft software. Cumulative probability plots for inter-event interval and amplitude of mEPSCs were generated for each cell, and plots from WT and KO cells were averaged to produce the plots shown in the figures. In addition, date were analysed by taking the first 100 events from each cell (the first 100 events were used to prevent bias from very active cells), pooling of these events for WT and KO condition, and generation of cumulative probability plots from the pooled data. The same results were obtained using either analysis method.

In some recordings Alexa 488 was included in the patch pipette solution. Slices were fixed for 1 hour in 4% PFA on ice following recording, washed and mounted in Vectashield for imaging. In parallel experiments vibratome sections were prepared from Gpc4 WT and KO mice that had been crossed to Thy1-GFP-M mice to label sparse subsets of CA1 pyramidal neurons with GFP, and processed in the same way. Labelled cells were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope. Z-stacks were acquired to encompass all of the dendritic area, and the maximum projection of the dendritic area generated. Total dendrite length was analysed using HCA-vision Neurite Analysis software.

C57bl6 mouse pups at P7 were used for purifications. Astrocytes were purified using integrin beta 5 immunopanning as described in 5 . Neurons were purified using L1 immunopanning as described in 30 . RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit following manufacturer’s instructions.

For expression analysis, template cDNA was prepared from 50 to 200 ng of total RNA by reverse transcription. Immunopanned cells from either cortex or hippocampus were paired, and purity was assessed by enrichment for astrocyte marker (GFAP) and neuron marker (Tuj1). Gene expression was quantified using real time quantitative PCR in combination with gene specific primers and the SYBR GREEN system (Roche). The reactions were performed on an Eppendorf Realplex4 cycler (Eppendorf). All samples were run in duplicates. For each DNA fragment (primer pair) all biological samples, including the input standard curves, were amplified on a common 96-well plate in the same run. The following primer pairs were used:

Gapdh-fw: AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG

Gapdh-rev: TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA

Tuj-1-fw: TAGACCCCAGCGGCAACTAT

Tuj-1-rev: GTTCCAGGTTCCAAGTCCACC

Gfap-fw: GGGGCAAAAGCACCAAAGAAG

Gfap-rev: GGGACAACTTGTATTGTGAGCC

Gpc4-for: CTGGAGGGTCCTTTCAACATT

Gpc4-rev: GACATCAGTAACCAGTCGGTC

Gpc6-for: TAGTCCTGTATTGGCAGCCAC

Gpc6-rev: GGCTAATGTCTATAGCAGGGAA

Primers efficiency was determined by generating standard curves. For confirmation, qPCR products were sequenced. Values were normalized on Gapdh expression. Relative gene expression between paired samples was estimated using the 2 (−ΔΔct) method.

Full-length mouse cDNA for both glypican 4 and glypican 6 were used to generate probes, approximately 2kb in size (Open Biosystems: Gpc4 clone # 3967797, Gpc6 clone #5008374). Digoxigenin-labeled single-stranded antisense and sense riboprobes were prepared by transcription of the linearized plasmid using either T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerases and DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche) as per manufacturer’s instructions. In situ hybridizations were performed essentially as described (Schaeren-Wiemers and Gerfin-Moser, 1993), with some modifications for postnatal tissue. Briefly, 10 μm fresh frozen sections of mouse brain were air-dried and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. After washing with PBS for 3 × 10 minutes, sections were acetylated by incubation in 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl, 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min. After washing with PBS for 3 × 5 minutes, hybridization was performed with probes at concentrations of 200–500 ng/ml in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 5x Denhardt’s, 250 μg/ml bakers yeast RNA, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 72 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, slides were washed once in 0.2x SSC at 72°C for 60 minutes, once in 0.2x SSC at room temperature for 5 min, once in buffer B1 (0.1M Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150mM NaCl) for 5 minutes, incubated in B1 with 10% normal goat serum for 1 hour, and then incubated in B1 with 1% normal goat serum and 1:1000 anti-digoxygenin alkaline-phosphatase conjugated antibody (Roche) overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed 3 × 5 minutes in B1, equilibrated in buffer B3 (0.1M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100mM NaCl, 50mM MgCl2) for 4 × 15 minutes and then developed in B3 with 0.24 mg/ml levamisole 0.375 μl/ml NBT and 3.5 μl BCIP/ml (Roche) until a colour precipitate was visible. The reaction was stopped by washing once in TBST and four times in water, and slides were coverslipped with glycergel mounting medium (Dako).

For GFAP immunostaining, anti-mouse GFAP antibody (Sigma) at 1:1000 was added with anti-digoxygenin antibody overnight at 4 °C. After 3 × 5 minute washes in B1, anti-mouse Fc horseradish peroxidise-conjugated antibody was added in 1% goat serum in B1 (1:500) for 2 hours at room temperature before developing alkaline phosphatase. Following washes in water, horseradish peroxidise was developed using DAB reagent (Vector Labs) for 8 minutes. Slides were washed six times in water, and coverslipped with glycergel mounting medium.

Array tomography was carried out as described in 31 . Hippocampal slices from P12 glypican 4 KO and WT littermate controls were prepared in the same way as for electrophysiological analysis (300um vibratome sections of live tissue), fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4C, followed by dehydration and embedding in LRWhite resin using the benchtop protocol. Ribbons of 30–35 serial ultrathin sections (70–100 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome (Leica), mounted on subbed glass coverslips and immunostained using antibodies against VGlut1 (Guinea pig, Millipore), GluA1 (rabbit, Abcam) and Pan-maguk (mouse, NeuroMabs). Antibody binding was visualized using Alexa 488, 594, and 647-labeled goat secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Sections were mounted using SlowFade Gold antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were collected on a ZeissAxiovert 200M fluorescence microscope with AxioCam HRm CCD camera, using a Zeiss 63x/1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective. Hippocampal area CA1 stratum radiatum was imaged, to analyse synapses proximal to the pyramidal neuron cell body.

Tissue volumes were reconstructed and aligned using Image J (NIH) and the multistackreg plugin (Brad Busse), then cropped to include CA1 stratum radiatum so that the same volume was analysed across animals. Image deconvolution was carried out using a custom function in Matlab (Gordon Wang). Individual puncta were identified for each channel, then the number of Maguk+GluA1 co-localised puncta associated with a VGlut1 puncta were quantified using a custom function in Matlab (Gordon Wang). Puncta numbers were normalized to WT values.

All graphs represent average data with error bars ± S.E.M. Statistical analysis was either by Student’s t-test when only two groups were being compared, or by One Way ANOVA when three or more groups were compared.
