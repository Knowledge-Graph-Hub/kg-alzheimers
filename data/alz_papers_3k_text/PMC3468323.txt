Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders

# Abstract
Advanced age is the main risk factor for most chronic diseases and functional deficits in humans, but the fundamental mechanisms that drive ageing remain largely unknown, impeding the development of interventions that might delay or prevent age-related disorders and maximize healthy lifespan. Cellular senescence, which halts the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is an important mechanism to constrain the malignant progression of tumour cells 1 , 2 . Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs with ageing 3 and have been hypothesized to disrupt tissue structure and function because of the components they secrete 4 , 5 . However, whether senescent cells are causally implicated in age-related dysfunction and whether their removal is beneficial has remained unknown. To address these fundamental questions, we made use of a biomarker for senescence, p16 Ink4a , to design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC , for inducible elimination of p16 Ink4a -positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Here we show that in the BubR1 progeroid mouse background, INK-ATTAC removes p16 Ink4a -positive senescent cells upon drug treatment. In tissues—such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and eye—in which p16 Ink4a contributes to the acquisition of age-related pathologies, life-long removal of p16 Ink4a -expressing cells delayed onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated progression of already established age-related disorders. These data indicate that cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan.

## METHODS
The INK-ATTAC transgenic construct was made as follows. The FKBP–Casp8 fragment was subcloned from the aP2-ATTAC transgenic construct 6 (a gift from P. Scherer) and inserted into pBlueScriptII (Stratagene). A 2,617-bp segment of the murine p16 Ink4a promoter was PCR amplified from BAC DNA to replace the aP2 promoter. An IRES-EGFP fragment was inserted 3′ of the ATTAC. Transgenic founders were obtained by pronuclear injection of the INK-ATTAC construct into FVB oocytes. A PCR-based method was used for INK-ATTAC transgene identification (primer sequences are available upon request). BubR1 H/H mice were generated as previously described 12 . For AP20187 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals) treatments, animals were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 3 days with 0.2 μg g −1 body weight of the dimer-inducing drug 6 from weaning (‘life-long’) or 5-months on (‘late-life’). All mice were on a mixed 129 × C57BL/6 × FVB genetic background. Animals were housed in a pathogen-free barrier environment throughout the study. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved experimental procedures on mice.

Prism software was used for the generation of all survival curves and statistical analyses. Two-tailed unpaired t tests were used for pairwise significance analysis in the following figures: Fig. 1c, f and h ; Fig. 2d–h ; Fig. 3b–e ; Fig. 4a–e, g ; Supplementary Fig. 1b ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Fig. 5a–c ; Supplementary Fig. 6 ; and Supplementary Fig. 7 . Log-rank tests were used to determine overall and pairwise significance for incidence curves in Fig. 2b and survival curves in Supplementary Fig. 5d . For consistency in these comparisons, the following identifies the significance values: * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001.

Culture of bone marrow cells was as previously described 25 . Briefly, tibia and femur bones of 2-month-old WT;INK-ATTAC transgenic mouse lines were collected and flushed with DMEM containing 15% FBS. After centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min and counting of viable cells with trypan blue, cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 15% FBS to a final concentration of 5 × 10 6 viable cells per ml. Initially, cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 3.5 ml well −1 (1.9 × 10 6 cells cm −2 ). Cultures were kept in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C for 72 h, when non-adherent cells were removed by changing the medium. Assays were performed on cells that had been trypsinized and seeded to confluency in 24-well plates. To induce senescence and evaluate expression of the INK-ATTAC transgene, cells were treated with 1 μM rosiglitazone (Cayman Chemical Company) or with vehicle. The accumulation of GFP + cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy and transgene expression was verified by immunofluorescence staining for Flag (Origene) as described 26 . After 5 days of rosiglitazone treatment, cells were washed with PBS and treated with vehicle, 1 μM rosiglitazone, 10 nM AP20187, or both. After 48 h, cultures were fixed and stained for SA-β-Gal activity as described 27 . WT;INK-ATTAC MEFs were generated and cultured as previously described 12 . For induction of replicative senescence, WT;INK-ATTAC MEF cultures were maintained in 20% O 2 for 12–15 passages. For oncogene-induced senescence, early passage MEFs were infected with concentrated pBABE puro H-ras G12V retrovirus (Addgene plasmid 9051) for 48 h. MEFs were then cultured in DMEM containing puromycin (2 μg ml −1 ) for 5 days. Cells from serial passage and H-ras induced senescence were sorted into GFP + and GFP − populations using a FACS Aria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) running FACSDiva software (serial passaging and H-ras expression yielded cultures with approximately 90% and 50% GFP + cells, respectively). Sorted cells were transferred to polyethylenimine-coated chambered slides and stained for SA-β-Gal according to manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling).

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT–PCR from whole-mouse tissue were performed as previously described 15 . To perform qRT–PCR on GFP + and GFP − cell populations of IAT, single-cell suspensions of stromal vascular fraction were prepared from ~50 mg IAT as described 28 . Cell sorting was performed as described above. RNA was extracted from the collected cells using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesized using a WT-Ovation RNA Amplification kit (NuGEN Technologies), according to the manufacturers’ protocols. qRT–PCR primers were as follows: FKBP–Casp8 forward, GAATCACAGACTTTGGACAAAGTT; FKBP–Casp8 reverse, GGTCAAAGC CCCTGCATCCAAG; EGFP forward, CAAACTACAACAGCCACAA CG; EGFP reverse, GGTCACGAACTCCAGCAG. Sequences of other primers used were as previously described 15 .

Bi-weekly checks for lordokyphosis and cataracts were performed as described 15 . Skeletal muscle fibre diameter measurements were performed on cross-sections of gastrocnemius and abdominal muscles of female mice as described 15 . Fifty total fibres per sample were measured using a calibrated computer program (Olympus MicroSuite Five). Fat cell diameter measurements were performed on IAT according to the same method. Dissection, histology and measurements of dermal and adipose layers of skin were performed as described previously 12 , although the lateral skin between the front and hind limb was used because this adipose layer is nearly three times thicker than dorsal skin. Measurements of body weight, length, gastrocnemius muscle and assorted adipose depots were performed on 10-month-old females. Bone mineral content, bone mineral density and total body adipose tissue were analysed by DEXA scanning as previously described 6 . Exercise measurements were performed on 10-month-old mice as previously described 29 . Animals were acclimated for 3 days for 5 min at a speed of 5 m min −1 before experimentation. For the experiment, the speed of the treadmill began at 5 m min −1 and was increased to 8 m min −1 after 2 min. Thereafter, the speed was increased at a rate of 2 m min −1 every 2 min and the time (in seconds) and distance (in metres) to exhaustion, as defined by an inability to move along the treadmill with stimulation, were determined. The formula to determine the amount of work ( J ) performed was: mass (kg) × g (9.8 m s −2 ) × distance (m) × sin (θ) (with an incline of θ = 5°). Cardiac arrhythmia measurements were performed using a Vevo2100 ultrasound system (Visualsonics) as previously described 30 .

Analyses for in vivo BrdU incorporation were performed in 10-month-old female mice as described 15 . Adipose tissue depots were stained for SA-β-Gal activity as previously described 12 .
