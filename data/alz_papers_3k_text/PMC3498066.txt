# Title
An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes

# Abstract
Through characterising the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help understand the genetic contribution to disease. We describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methodologies to integrate information across multiple algorithms and diverse data sources we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million indels and over 14 thousand larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways and that each individual harbours hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as transcription-factor-motif disrupting changes. This resource, which captures up to 98% of accessible SNPs at a frequency of 1% in populations of medical genetics focus, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.

## The distribution of genetic variation within and between populations
The integrated data set provides a detailed view of variation across multiple populations (illustrated in Fig. 2a ). Most common variants (94% of variants with frequency ≥5% in the figure) were known prior to the current phase of the project and had their haplotype structure mapped through earlier projects 2 , 9 . In contrast, only 62% of variants in the range 0.5-5% and 13% of variants with frequency ≤ 0.5% had been described previously. For analysis, populations are grouped by the predominant component of ancestry: Europe (CEU, TSI, GBR, FIN, IBS), Africa (YRI, LWK, ASW), East Asia (CHB, JPT, CHS) and the Americas (MXL, CLM, PUR). Variants present at 10% and above across the entire sample are almost all found in all populations studied. In contrast, 17% of low-frequency variants in the range 0.5-5% were observed in a single ancestry group and 53% of rare variants at 0.5% were observed in a single population ( Fig. 2b ). Within ancestry groups, common variants are weakly differentiated (most within-group estimates of F ST are < 1%; Table S11 ), although below 0.5% frequency variants are up to twice as likely to be found within the same population compared to random sample from the ancestry group ( Fig. S6a ). The degree of rare-variant differentiation varies between populations. For example, within Europe, the IBS and FIN populations carry excesses of rare variants ( Fig. S6b ), which can arise through events such as recent bottlenecks 10 , ‘clan’ breeding structures 11 and admixture with diverged populations 12 .

Some common variants show strong differentiation between populations within ancestry-based groups ( Table S12 ), many of which are likely to have been driven by local adaptation either directly or through hitch-hiking. For example, the strongest differentiation between AFR populations is in NRSF transcription-factor peak (PANC1-cell-line) 13 upstream of ST8SIA1 (difference in derived allele frequency LWK-YRI of 0.475 at rs7960970), whose product is involved in ganglioside generation 14 . Overall, we find a range of 17-343 SNPs (fewest = CEU-GBR, most = FIN-TSI) showing a difference in frequency of at least 0.25 between pairs of populations within an ancestry-group.

The derived allele frequency distribution shows substantial divergence between populations below a frequency of 40% ( Fig. 2c ), such that individuals from populations with substantial African ancestry (YRI, LWK, ASW) carry up to three times as many low-frequency variants (0.5-5% frequency) as those of European or East Asian origin, reflecting ancestral bottlenecks in non-African populations 15 . However, individuals from all populations show an enrichment of rare (<0.5%) variants, reflecting recent explosive increases in population size and the effects of geographic differentiation 6 , 16 . Compared to the expectations from a model of constant population size, individuals from all populations show a substantial excess of high-frequency derived variants (>80% frequency).

Because rare variants are typically recent, their patterns of sharing can reveal aspects of population history. Variants present twice across the entire sample (referred to as f 2 variants), typically the most recent of informative mutations, are found within the same population in 53% of cases ( Fig. 3a ). However, between-population sharing identifies recent historical connections. For example, where one of the individuals carrying an f 2 variant is from the Spanish population (IBS) and the other is not (referred to as IBS-X), the other individual is more likely to come from the AMR populations (48%, correcting for sample size) than elsewhere in Europe (41%). Within the East Asian populations, CHS and CHB show stronger f 2 sharing to each other (58% and 53% of CHS-X and CHB-X variants respectively) than either does to JPT, but JPT is closer to CHB than to CHS (44% versus 35% of JPT-X variants). Within African-ancestry populations, the ASW are closer to the YRI (42% of ASW-X f 2 variants) compared to the LWK (28%), in line with historical information 17 and genetic evidence based on common SNPs 18 . Some sharing patterns are surprising; for example, 2.5% of the f 2 FIN-X variants are shared with YRI or LWK populations.

Independent evidence about variant age comes from the length of the shared haplotypes on which they are found. We find, as expected, a negative correlation between variant frequency and the median length of shared haplotypes, such that chromosomes carrying variants at 1% frequency share haplotypes of 100-150 kb (typically 0.08-0.13 cM; Figs. 3b and S7a ), although the distribution is highly skewed and 2-5% of haplotypes around the rarest SNPs extend over 1 Mb ( Figs. S7b,c ). Haplotype phasing and genotype calling errors will limit the ability to detect long shared haplotypes and the observed lengths are a factor of 2-3 shorter than predicted by models that allow for recent explosive growth 6 ( Fig. S7a ). Nevertheless, the haplotype length for variants shared within and between populations is informative about relative allele age. Within populations and between populations where there is recent shared ancestry (e.g., through admixture and within continents) f 2 variants typically lie on long shared haplotypes (median within ancestry group 103 kb, Fig. S8 ). In contrast, between populations with no recent shared ancestry, f 2 variants are present on very short haplotypes, for example, an average of 11 kb for FIN-YRI f 2 variants (median between ancestry groups excluding admixture is 15 kb), and are therefore likely to reflect recurrent mutations and chance ancient coalescent events.

To analyse populations with substantial historical admixture, statistical methods were applied to each individual to infer regions of the genome with different ancestries. Populations and individuals vary substantially in admixture proportions. For example, the MXL population contains the greatest proportion of Native American ancestry (47% on average compared to 24% in CLM and 13% in PUR), but the proportion varies from 3% to 92% between individuals ( Fig. S9a ). Rates of variant discovery, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous variation and the proportion of variants that are novel vary systematically between regions with different ancestries. Regions of Native American ancestry show less variation, but a higher fraction of the variants discovered are novel (3.0% of variants per sample, Fig. 3c ) compared to regions of European ancestry (2.6%). Regions of African ancestry show the highest rates of novelty (6.2%) and heterozygosity ( Fig. S9b,c ).

## The functional spectrum of human variation
The Phase 1 data enable us to compare, for different genomic features and variant types, the effects of purifying selection on evolutionary conservation 19 , the allele frequency distribution and the level of differentiation between populations. At the most highly conserved coding sites, 85% of nonsynonymous (NonSyn) variants and over 90% of STOP gain and splice-disrupting variants are below 0.5% in frequency , compared to 65% of synonymous (Syn) variants ( Fig. 4a ). In general, the rare variant excess tracks the level of evolutionary conservation for variants of most functional consequence, but varies systematically between types (e.g., for a given level of conservation enhancer variants have a higher rare variant excess than variants in transcription factor motifs). However, STOP gains and, to a lesser-extent, splice-site disrupting changes, show elevated rare-variant excess whatever the conservation of the base in which they occur, as such mutations can be highly deleterious whatever the level of sequence conservation. Interestingly, the least conserved splice-disrupting variants show rare-variant load similar to synonymous and non-coding regions suggesting that these alternative transcripts are under very weak selective constraint. Sites at which variants are observed are typically less conserved than average (for example, sites with NonSyn variants are, on average, as conserved as third codon positions, Fig S10 ).

A simple way of estimating the segregating load arising from rare, deleterious mutations across a set of genes comes from comparing the ratios of NonSyn to Syn variants in different frequency ranges. The NonSyn to Syn ratio among rare (<0.5%) variants is typically in the range 1-2 and among common variants in the range 0.5-1.5, suggesting that 25-50% of rare NonSyn variants are deleterious. However, the segregating rare load among gene groups in KEGG pathways 20 varies substantially ( Fig. S11a ; Table S13 ). Certain groups (e.g., ECM-receptor interaction, DNA replication and pentose phosphate pathway) show a substantial excess of rare coding mutations, which is only weakly correlated with the average degree of evolutionary conservation. Pathways and processes showing an excess of rare functional variants vary between continents ( Fig. S11b ). Moreover, the excess of rare NonSyn variants is typically higher in populations of European and East Asian ancestry (for example, the ECM-receptor interaction pathway load is strongest in EUR). Other groups of genes (for example, those associated with allograft rejection) actually have a high NonSyn:Syn ratio in common variants, potentially indicating the effects of positive selection.

Genome-wide data provide important insights into the rates of functional polymorphism in the non-coding genome. For example, we consider motifs matching the consensus for transcriptional repressor CTCF, which has a well-characterised and highly conserved binding motif 21 . Within CTCF-binding peaks experimentally defined by chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), average levels of conservation within the motif are comparable to third codon positions, while outside peaks there is no conservation ( Fig. 4c ). Within peaks levels of genetic diversity are typically reduced 25-75%, depending on the position in the motif ( Fig. 4c ). Unexpectedly, the reduction in diversity at some degenerate positions, for example position 8 in the motif, is as great as that at nondegenerate positions, suggesting that motif degeneracy may not have a simple relationship with functional importance. Variants within peaks show a weak but consistent excess of rare variation (proportion with frequency <0.5% is 61% within peaks compared to 58% outside peaks, Fig. S12 ) supporting the hypothesis that regulatory sequences harbour substantial amounts of weakly deleterious variation.

Purifying selection can also affect population differentiation if its strength and efficacy vary among populations. Although the magnitude of the effect is weak, nonsynonymous variants consistently show greater levels of population differentiation than synonymous variants, for variants of frequency less than 10% ( Fig. S13 ).

## Uses of 1000 Genomes Project data in medical genetics
Data from the 1000 Genomes Project are widely used to screen variants discovered in exome data from individuals with genetic disorders 22 and in cancer genome projects 23 . The enhanced catalogue presented here improves the power of such screening. Moreover, it provides a ‘null expectation’ for the number of rare, low-frequency and common variants with different functional consequences typically found in randomly-sampled individuals from different populations.

Estimates of the overall numbers of variants with different sequence consequences are comparable to previous values 1 , 20 - 22 ( Table S14 ). However, only a fraction of these are likely to be functionally-relevant. A more accurate picture of the number of functional variants is given by the number of variants segregating either at conserved positions (here defined as sites with a GERP 19 conservation score of >2), or where the function (e.g., STOP gain) is strong and independent of conservation ( Table 2 ). We find that individuals typically carry over 2,500 nonsynonymous variants at conserved positions, 20-40 variants identified as damaging 24 at conserved sites and about 150 loss-of-function variants (LOF: STOP gains, frameshift indels in coding sequence and disruptions to essential splice-sites). However, most of these are common (>5%) or low-frequency (0.5-5%) such that the numbers of rare (<0.5%) variants in these categories (which might be considered as pathological candidates) are much lower; 130-400 nonsynonymous variants per individual, 10-20 LOF variants, 2-5 damaging mutations and 1-2 variants identified previously from cancer genome sequencing 25 . By comparison to synonymous variants, we can estimate the excess of rare variants; those mutations that are sufficiently deleterious that they will never reach high frequency. We estimate that individuals carry an excess of 76-190 rare deleterious nonsynonymous variants and up to 20 LOF and disease-associated variants. Interestingly, the overall excess of low-frequency variants is similar to that of rare variants ( Table 2 ). Because many variants contributing to disease risk are likely to be segregating at low frequency, we recommend that variant frequency be considered when using the resource to identify pathological candidates.

The combination of variation data with information about regulatory function 13 can potentially improve the power to detect pathological non-coding variants. We find that individuals typically harbour several thousands of variants (and several hundred rare variants) in conserved (GERP conservation score >2) UTRs, non-coding RNAs and transcription-factor binding motifs ( Table 2 ). Within experimentally-defined transcription factor binding sites, individuals carry 700-900 conserved motif losses (for the transcription factors analysed, see Supplementary Information ), of which 18-69 are rare (<0.5%) and which show strong evidence for being selected against. Motif gains are rarer (~200 per individual at conserved sites) but they also show evidence for an excess of rare variants compared to conserved sites with no functional annotation ( Table 2 ). Many of these changes are likely to have weak, slightly deleterious effects on gene regulation and function.

A second major use of the 1000 Genomes Project data in medical genetics is imputing genotypes in existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 26 . For common variants, the accuracy of using the Phase 1 data to impute genotypes at sites not on the original GWAS chip is typically 90-95% in non-African and approximately 90% in African-ancestry genomes ( Figs. 5a , S14a ), which is comparable to the accuracy achieved with high quality benchmark haplotypes ( Fig. S14b ). Imputation accuracy is similar for intergenic SNPs, exome SNPs, indels and large deletions (see also Fig. S14c ), despite the different amounts of information about such variants and accuracy of genotypes. For low-frequency variants (1-5%), imputed genotypes have between 60% and 90% accuracy in all populations, including those with admixed ancestry (also comparable to the accuracy from trio-phased haplotypes; Fig. S14b ).

Imputation has two primary uses: fine-mapping existing association signals and detecting novel associations. GWAS have had only a few examples of successful fine-mapping to single causal variants 27 , 28 , often because of extensive haplotype structure within regions of association 29 , 30 . We find that, in Europeans, each previously reported GWAS signal 31 is, on average, in linkage disequilibrium (r 2 ≥ 0.5) with 56 variants: 51.5 SNPs and 4.5 indels. In 19% of cases at least one of these variants changes the coding sequence of a nearby gene (compared to 12% in control variants matched for frequency, distance to nearest gene and ascertainment in GWAS arrays) and in 65% of cases at least one of these is at a site with GERP>2 (68% in matched controls). The size of the associated region is typically <200 kb in length ( Figure 5b ). Our observations suggest that trans-ethnic fine-mapping experiments are likely to be especially valuable: among the 56 variants that are in strong linkage disequilibrium with a typical GWAS signal, ~15 show strong disequilibrium across our four continental groupings ( Table S15 ). Compared to earlier catalogs, our current resource increases the number of variants in linkage disequilibrium with each GWAS signal by 25% compared to the Pilot phase of the project and by greater than 2-fold compared to the HapMap resource.

## Discussion
The success of exome sequencing in Mendelian disease genetics 32 and the discovery of rare and low-frequency disease-associated variants in genes associated with complex diseases 27 , 33 , 34 strongly support the hypothesis that, in addition to factors such as epistasis 35 , 36 and gene-environment interactions 37 , many additional genetic risk factors of substantial effect size remain to be discovered through studies of rare variation. The data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project not only aid the interpretation of all genetic association studies, but also provide lessons on how best to design and analyse sequencing-based studies of disease.

The utility and cost-effectiveness of collecting multiple data types (low-coverage whole genome sequence, targeted exome data, SNP genotype data) for finding variants and reconstructing haplotypes are demonstrated here. Exome capture provides private and rare variants that are missed by low-coverage data (approximately 60% of the singleton variants in the sample were detected only from exome data compared to 5% only detected from low-coverage data, Fig. S15 ). However, whole-genome data enable characterisation of functional non-coding variation and accurate haplotype estimation, which are essential for the analysis of cis-effects around genes, for example those arising from variation in upstream regulatory regions 38 . There are also benefits from integrating SNP array data, for example to improve genotype estimation 39 and to aid haplotype estimation where array data have been collected on additional family members. In principle, any sources of genotype information (e.g., from array CGH) could be integrated using the statistical methods developed here.

Major methodological advances in Phase 1, including improved methods for detecting and genotyping variants 40 , statistical and machine-learning methods for evaluating the quality of candidate variant calls, modelling of genotype likelihoods and performing statistical haplotype integration 41 , have generated a high-quality resource. However, regions of low sequence complexity, satellite regions, large repeats and many large-scale structural variants, including copy-number polymorphisms, segmental duplications and inversions (which constitute most of the “inaccessible genome”), continue to present a major challenge for short-read technologies. Some issues are likely to be improved by methodological developments such as better modelling of read-level errors, integrating de novo assembly 42 , 43 and combining multiple sources of information to aid genotyping of structurally-diverse regions 40 , 44 . Importantly, even subtle differences in data type, data processing or algorithms may lead to systematic differences in false-positive and false negative error modes between samples. Such differences complicate efforts to compare genotypes between sequencing studies. Moreover, analyses that naively combine variant calls and genotypes across heterogeneous data sets are vulnerable to artifact. Analyses across multiple data sets must therefore either process them in standard ways or use meta-analysis approaches that combine association statistics (but not raw data) across studies.

Finally, the analysis of low-frequency variation demonstrates both the pervasive effects of purifying selection at functionally-relevant sites in the genome and how this can interact with population history to lead to substantial local differentiation, even when standard metrics of structure such as F ST are very small. The effect arises primarily because rare variants tend to be recent and thus tend to be geographically restricted 6 - 8 . The implication is that the interpretation of rare variants in individuals with a particular disease should be within the context of the local (either geographic or ancestry-based) genetic background. Moreover, it argues for the value of continuing to sequence individuals from diverse populations to characterise the spectrum of human genetic variation and support disease studies across diverse groups. A further 1500 individuals from 11 new populations, including at least 15 high-depth trios, will form the final phase of this project.
