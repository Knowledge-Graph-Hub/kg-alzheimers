# Title
An epigenetic blockade of cognitive functions in the neurodegenerating brain

# Abstract
Cognitive decline is a debilitating feature of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 1 . The causes leading to such impairment are only poorly understood and effective treatments are slow to emerge 2 . Here, we show that cognitive capacities in the neurodegenerating brain are constrained by an epigenetic blockade of gene transcription that is potentially reversible. This blockade is mediated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) 2, which is increased by AD-related neurotoxic insults in vitro , in two mouse models of neurodegeneration, and in AD patients. HDAC2 associates with and reduces the histone acetylation of genes important for learning and memory, which show a concomitant decrease in expression. Importantly, reversing the buildup of HDAC2 by shRNA-mediated knockdown unlocks the repression of these genes, re-instates structural and synaptic plasticity, and abolishes neurodegeneration-associated memory impairments. These findings advocate for the development of HDAC2-selective inhibitors, and suggest that cognitive capacities following neurodegeneration are not entirely lost, but merely impaired by this epigenetic blockade.

## METHODS
Human material was obtained from the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital (protocol number 2004-P-001613/4) and from the Boston Medical Center (H-24454) with informed consent by all donors. Hippocampal blocks (at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus) were fixed in paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 10μm thickness. Following antigen retrieval (Biogenex), brain slices were rehydrated using xylene/ethanol, blocked with 5% milk serum in TBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature and incubated at 4°C overnight in TBS containing 5% milk-serum in the following antibodies: amyloid-β, tau (Dako), HDAC1, HDAC2 (Abcam), or HDAC3 (Cell Signaling). Next, they were washed in PBS (pH 7.4), incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Biogenex) and visualized with DAB (Biogenex). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated with ethanol/xylene. Images were quantified by an experimenter blind to BB stages using ImageJ 1.42q.

All mouse work was approved by the Committee for Animal Care of the Division of Comparative Medicine at MIT. Adult (3-6 months old) male double transgenic CK-p25 mice 9 , 10 , 13 , 6-month old male transgenic 5xFAD mice 16 , and 3-4 month-old Cdk5cKO mice 26 and their respective control littermates were used for the experiments unless otherwise noted; for CK-p25 mice, all behavioral experiments took place between 6-8 weeks of p25 induction, the time when cognitive deficits are first visible 13 . Behavioral experiments were conducted blindly and essentially as described 13 . Open field behavior was monitored using the VersaMax system (Accuscan) during 20min. For fear conditioning, mice were put in the conditioning chamber (TSE systems) for 3min, after which they received a one-time 2s footshock (0.8mA). Animals were then left in the box for another 30s. 24h later, the mice were put into the same box and their freezing behavior was scored during 3min. For the water maze that took place in a round tank (1.2m in diameter) filled with white opaque water, mice were first habituated to the task with the platform being visible for two trials. During habitation and the acquisition phase, mice were allowed to swim for 60s or until the reached the platform (monitored by HVS Image). Animals that did not reach the platform after 60s were gently guided towards it; all animals were allowed to remain on the platform for 15s. For testing, mice were put back into the water without the platform 24h after that last training session, from a starting position different of the last starting position during the acquisition phase, and their time spent in each quadrant was recorded (HVS Image).

To record field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from CON, scr, CK-p25, scr and CK-p25, shHDAC2 mice. In brief, the brain was rapidly removed and transferred to ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) cutting solution containing 211mM sucrose, 3.3mM KCl, 1.3mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5mM CaCl 2 , 10mM MgCl 2 , 26mM NaHCO 3 and 11mM glucose. Hippocampal slices were cut with a VT1000S vibratome (Leica) and transferred for recovery to a holding chamber containing oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid consisting of 124mM NaCl, 3.3mM KCl, 1.3mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.5mM CaCl 2 , 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 26mMNaHCO 3 and 11mM glucose at 28-30°C for at least 1h before recording. CA1 field potentials evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation were measured. After recording of a stable baseline (at least 20 min), LTP was induced by four episodes of theta burst stimulation (TBS) with 10s intervals. TBS consisted of ten bursts (each with four pulses at 100Hz) of stimuli delivered every 200ms. Recordings were performed using an AM-1800 Microelectrode amplifier (A-M systems) and a Digidata 1440A A-D converter (Axon Instruments). All data were digitized and analyzed by the use of pClamp10 software (Axon Instruments). Basal synaptic input/output relationship was obtained by plotting fEPSP slopes against stimulation intensities. All experiments were performed by an experimenter blind to treatment groups.

Primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures (DIV 14-17) were treated with sense and antisense Aβ oligomers (1μM, Bachem) for 24h or H 2 O 2 (50μM, Mallinckrodt Chemicals, removed after 5min, and assessed 8h later) unless otherwise noted and mRNA and proteins extracted using Qiagen’s Allprep kit. For ChIP experiments, cortical cultures (DIV10-14) were used.

Dual luciferase assays were conducted on CAD cells 31 (ATCC) that were transfected using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with 0.5μg of the proximal promoter region of HDAC2 containing the GRE consensus sequence (CAAGAAGAAAGTGGCTAC) or with the proximal promoter region without the GRE sequence subcloned into the pGL3 reporter vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cotransfected with 0.05μg of the constitutively active form of GR 32 , GR526, or GRS211A, and treated with 1μM Aβ 1-42 oligomers or with 50μM H 2 O 2 .

For site-directed mutagenesis, the cDNA for the full-length human glucocorticoid receptor (Addgene) was used and serine 211 was replaced by alanine using the QuickChange Lightning Kit (Agilent Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructs were verified by sequencing (Genewiz). The following mutagenesis primers were used:

5′-GTAAAGAGACGAATGAGGCTCCTTGGAGATCAGACC-3′ (forward)

5′-GGTCTGATCTCCAAGGAGCCTCATTCGTCTCTTTAC-3′ (reverse).

ICC and mouse IHC were performed as described 7 . ICC and IHCs on different experimental conditions were performed with the same antibody solution at the same time to assure identical staining conditions. A negative ( i.e. , no antibody) control was included simultaneously. In brief, for IHC, mice were perfused with 10% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia (ketamine, xylazine) and their brains sectioned at 0.35μm thickness using a vibratome (Leica). For ICC, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Slices/cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked and incubated overnight with 0.1% Triton X-100/10% fetal bovine serum in PBS containing primary antibodies: HDAC1, HDAC2 (Abcam), HDAC3 (Cell Signaling), phospho-GR1 (S211) (Cell Signaling), GR (Abcam), or GFP (Aves Labs). Primary antibodies were visualized with Alexa-Fluor 488, Cy3 and Cy5 antibodies (Molecular Probes), neuronal nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Note that for staining of shRNA-injected animals, mCherry was visualized without staining, and only Cy2 and Cy5 secondary antibodies were used. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss) at identical settings at the highest intensity for each of the conditions. Images were quantified using ImageJ 1.42q by an experimenter blind to treatment groups, whenever possible. Per experimental condition, 20-40 representative cells were analyzed, and the mean signal intensity was measured. To assess the specificity of the HDAC2 immunostaining, adult HDAC2 -/- mice were used as previously described 7 . For a specificity control of the PGR1 antibody, Calf Intestine Phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs) treatment on ICC slides was performed as described previously 33 . CIP or H 2 O were applied for 40min in Buffer 3 (New England Biolabs).

Western blots, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene expression analyses were performed as described elsewhere 34 with the following modifications, and expressed as fold change of the respective control conditions. For Western blots, proteins were extracted using 1x RIPA buffer containing proteinase (complete, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (1mM β-glycerophosphate, 10mM NaF, 0.1mM Na 3 VO 4 ), transferred onto PVDF membranes (Biorad) and stripped using stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific). The following primary antibodies were used: Acetyl-K (Cell Signaling), α- and β-tubulin, β-actin (Sigma), Cdk5 (Santa Cruz), HDAC1, HDAC2 (Abcam), HDAC3, Phospho-GR1 (S211) (Cell Signaling), GR1 (Abcam), p53 (Cell Signaling), or tau (Invitrogen). Secondary antibodies were HRP-linked (GE Healthcare). Signal intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.42q and normalized to values of β-actin, α- or β-tubulin. Phospho-GR1 was first normalized to GR1. 3-8 animals were used per condition. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation was performed as described elsewhere 34 .

For Co-IP, hippocampal lysates were incubated with HDAC2 (Abcam) or IgG (Sigma) and the immunoprecipitated extracts probed for mSin3A, MTA2 (Abcam), CoRest (Millipore), LSD1 (Cell Signaling), or HDAC2. Signal intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.42q, and normalized to input. 3-4 animals were used per condition.

For ChIP, tissue samples were homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing proteinase (complete, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (1mM β-glycerophosphate, 10mM NaF, 0.1mM Na 3 VO 4 ) and chromatin was sonicated using a Branson Digital Sonifier with 10 rounds of 15s at 25% power per sample on ice to 200-400bp in length. For ChIP of primary cortical cultures, approximately 1×10 6 cells were crosslinked in 37% formaldehyde (Sigma), quenched with 20× glycine (Sigma), washed with PBS and cell lysis buffer containing both phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (Roche) and sonicated in nuclear lysis buffer using a Vibra Cell Sonifier with 3× 3 pulses of 5s at 35% power (50% duty) on ice. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against HDAC1, HDAC2 (Abcam), HDAC3 (Santa Cruz), acetyl H2BK5, acetyl H3K14 (Abcam), acetyl H4K5, acetyl H4K12 (Millipore), phospho-GR1 (S211) (Cell Signaling), or phospho-RNA Pol II (Abcam). DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (American Bioanalytical) and subjected to quantitative PCR (Biorad Thermal Cycler) using primers specific to the promoter regions of the genes assayed (see Supplementary Table 2 and 3 for primer sequences). The fluorescent signal of the amplified DNA (SYBR green, Biorad) was normalized to input. 4-8 samples were used per condition.

For gene expression analysis, mRNA was extracted (Qiagen), reverse-transcribed (Invitrogen) and quantitatively amplified on a thermal cycler (Biorad) using SYBR green (Biorad) and gene-specific primers (see Supplementary Table 4 ). The comparative Ct method 35 was used to examine differences in gene expression. Values were normalized to expression levels of Gapdh. 4-8 samples were used per condition.

For validation of the knockdown efficacy of HDAC2 RNAi in neurons, short hairpins targeting the open reading frame of mouse Hdac2 mRNA from the Broad Institute’s RNAi consortium shRNA library ( www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc/lib ) were packaged into lentiviral vectors 36 and used to infect dissociated primary mouse embryonic (gestation day 18) cortical cultures, prepared as described 7 . Primary cultures were infected at DIV4. Cells were harvested ten days after infection, and protein levels were measured by western blotting. The target sequences for the two effective shRNAs are CCCAATGAGTTGCCATATAAT (HDAC2 shRNA 2-1, TRCN0000039395) and CGAGCATCAGACAAACGGATA (HDAC2 shRNA 2-4, TRCN0000039397).

After validation, scramble shRNA 37 or HDAC2-shRNA constructs were subcloned under the CaMKII-U6 promoter into the pAAV entry vector fused to mCherry, tested again in mouse primary hippocampal cultures (DIV7), and high titer (1-4×10 12 viral particles) adeno-associated viruses (AAV, serotype 2.5) were produced at the University of North Carolina Vector Core facility. 1μl of shRNA-containing AAV was stereotaxically injected into hippocampal area CA1 (anterior-posterior position −2.0mm, medial-lateral position ±1.6mm, dorso-ventral −1.5mm from Bregma) of both hemispheres at 0.1μl/min. Injection needles were left in place 5min after injection to assure even distribution of the virus. Injections were performed 4 weeks before behavioral testing. All infusion surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions and anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine) in accordance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Division of Comparative Medicine guidelines.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5. One-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey post-hoc tests, or one-tailed Student’s t-tests were used unless otherwise indicated. All data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was set at p≤0.05.
