# Title
Temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in the human prefrontal cortex

# Abstract
Previous investigations have combined transcriptional and genetic analyses in human cell lines 1 - 3 , but few have applied these techniques to human neural tissue 4 - 8 . To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application ( http://www.libd.org/braincloud ).

## METHODS SUMMARY
Post-mortem human brains from the NIMH Brain Tissue Collection in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (NIMH, CBDB) were obtained at autopsy. Additional brain tissue samples were provided by the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders ( http://www.BTBank.org ). Clinical characterization, diagnoses and macro- and microscopic neuropathological examinations, toxicological analysis, RNA extraction and quality control measures were performed using a standardized paradigm. Subjects with evidence of neuropathology, drug use, alcohol abuse, or psychiatric illness were excluded. Subject demographics and sample details are contained in Supplementary Table 7 .

Post-mortem PFC grey matter tissue homogenates were obtained from all subjects. Total RNA was extracted, amplified and fluorescently labelled. Reference RNA was pooled from all samples and treated identically to sample RNAs. Labelled RNAs were hybridized to two-colour custom-spotted arrays from the NHGRI microarray core facility. After normalization 21 , log 2 intensity ratios were further adjusted to reduce the impact of known and unknown sources of systematic noise on gene expression measures using surrogate variable analysis 22 (SVA). Validation of microarray expression patterns was performed by Taqman qPCR ( Supplementary Table 8 ). In this study of RNA derived from tissue homogenates, differential gene expression within a population of cells stable in cell type is indistinguishable from a change in the abundance of cell types that express different genes. There is no doubt that both phenomena contribute to signals measured here in the prefrontal cortex.

DNA for genotyping was obtained from the cerebella of samples in the collection and applied to Illumina BeadArrays. Genotypes were called using BeadExpress software.

To generate functional gene groups for the analysis described in Fig. 2a and the text, microarray probes were annotated with data from numerous public, online sources. Enrichment of functional gene groups within various gene lists as described in the text was assessed by a standard hypergeometric test.

SNP–expression associations were carried out using linear models that included surrogate variables, age, life stage (as defined in Fig. 1b ), an interaction of age and life stage, sex, race and the SNP under investigation. SNP was included as a continuous variable.

## METHODS
The NIMH Brain Tissue Collection in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (NIMH, CBDB) obtained post-mortem human brains at autopsy primarily from the Offices of the Chief Medical Examiner of the District of Columbia, and of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Northern District, all with informed consent from the legal next of kin (protocol 90-M-0142 approved by the NIMH/NIH Institutional Review Board). Additional post-mortem fetal, infant, child and adolescent brain tissue samples were provided by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders ( http://www.BTBank.org ) under contracts NO1-HD-4-3368 and NO1-HD-4-3383. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland at Baltimore and the State of Maryland approved the protocol, and the tissue was donated to the NIMH under the terms of a Material Transfer Agreement. Clinical characterization, diagnoses, and macro- and microscopic neuropathological examinations were performed on all CBDB cases using a standardized paradigm. Details of tissue acquisition, handling, processing, dissection, clinical characterization, diagnoses, neuropathological examinations, RNA extraction and quality control measures were described previously 23 . The Brain and Tissue Bank cases were handled in a similar fashion ( http://medschool.umaryland.edu/BTBank/ProtocolMethods.html ). Toxicological analysis was performed on every case. Subjects with evidence of macro- or microscopic neuropathology, drug use, alcohol abuse, or psychiatric illness were excluded. Subject demographics and sample details are contained in Supplementary Table 7 .

Post-mortem tissue homogenates of PFC grey matter (DLPFC, that is, BA46/9 in postnatal samples and the corresponding region of PFC in fetal samples) were obtained from all subjects ( n = 269 after all exclusion criteria). Total RNA was extracted from ~100 mg of tissue using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) <5 were excluded. 500 ng of each total RNA sample was reverse transcribed with an oligo dT-T7 and amplified (T7) using the Ambion MessageAmp II kit (catalogue no. 1753, Ambion). The generated aminoallyl UTP-labelled antisense RNAs (aRNAs) were then coupled with Cy3 mono NHS ester CyDye from GE Healthcare. Reference RNA was pooled from all samples and was treated identically to sample RNAs, but was labelled with the Cy5 fluorescent dye. Two-colour custom-spotted oligonucleotide microarrays from the NHGRI microarray core facility using the Illumina Oligoset (HEEBO7) of 49,152 70-mer probes were used. After purification, the labelled aRNAs are hybridized overnight to the oligo arrays in 53 SSC, 25% formamide and 0.2% SDS buffer at 45 °C using Maui Mixer FL hybridization chambers (BioMicro Systems). The slides are then washed at room temperature in a series of SSC/SDS buffers and dried by centrifugation. A laser confocal scanner (Agilent Technologies) was used to scan the hybridized microarrays. DeArray software (Scanalytics, Inc.) was used to export intensity data. Probes that were non-human, nonspecific (that is, mapped to >1 expressed sequence), incorrectly annotated, or probes containing polymorphisms with minor allele frequency > 0.01 according to HapMap in either YRI or CEU populations were removed from the analysis. Intensities below an empirically determined low intensity cutoff of 5.3 on the log 2 scale were dropped from the data. Probes with fewer than half of the fetal or postnatal data pointsremaining after thisstep were removed. Additionally, outliers defined as >6 mean average deviations from the age-appropriate linear fit were removed. The total number of probes remaining was 30,176. After background correction on the linear scale, log 2 ratios (sample/reference) were normalized across mean log 2 florescent intensities using loess correction 21 . Missing data in the gene expression data matrix were imputed at this stage to enable both SVA and PCA. After normalization, log 2 ratios were further adjusted to reduce the impact of known and unknown sources of systematic noise on gene expression measures using SVA 22 . Two surrogate variables were generated and used to adjust log 2 ratios in all subsequent linear models. Correlation between the naively created surrogate variables and known sources of noise were evident: SV1 + RIN: r = 0.37, P = 4.7 × 10 −10 ; SV2 + ArrayBatch: r = 0.73; P < 2 × 10 −16 . All of these microarray data analyses were conducted using custom code and tools from the Bioconductor project ( http://www.bioconductor.org/ ) in the R statistical language ( http://www.r-project.org/ ). Validation of microarray expression patterns was performed by Taqman qPCR ( Supplementary Table 8 ).

DNA for genotyping was obtained from the cerebella of 266 of the total 269 samples in the collection and applied to either Illumina Infinium II 650K or Illumina Infinium HD Gemini 1M Duo BeadChips according to manufacturer’s protocols. Only genotypes common to both platforms are analysed here. Genotypes were called using BeadExpress software. SNPs were removed if the call rate was <98% (mean call rate for this study >99%), if not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( P < 0.001) within Caucasian and within African American races separately, or not polymorphic (MAF <0.01). The total number of SNPs remaining in the analysis was 625,439 (96.2%).

For each probe, a linear-spline model of expression across age was fit with a single change point. The change point was allowed to vary across the entire age range, and the change point that produced the lowest meansquared error was selected as the expression turning point for that probe. Data within the first and last decade of the range interrogated (0–10 and 70–80 years) were excluded to avoid edge effects ( n = 7,272 probes). See Fig. 1b (grey histogram).

This representation (see Fig. 1c ) was generated using 1 − r as a distance metric, where r is the pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient calculated across all gene expression probes for each pair of samples. These distances were coupled with an MDS algorithm to attempt to satisfy all the pairwise distances in two-dimensional space. For both MDS and PCA, three-dimensional analyses more precisely depict systematic age effects ( Supplementary Fig. 1 , parts 2 and 3). It is important to note in this analysis (and those shown in Figs 1b and 4 ) that because expression data are expressed as a ratio to reference here, the mean expression correlation across all samples is near zero: r = 0.02.

To generate functional gene groups for the analysis described in Fig. 2a and the text, we annotated all probes with data from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathways ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg ), the Gene Ontology project ( http://www.geneontology.org ), the Pfam database ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam ), mouse knockout phenotypes and human disease phenotypes collected by Kevin Becker’sgroup at the National Institute on Ageing 24 , 25 , the GSA project at Stanford ( http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/GSA ) and the GSEA project at the Broad Institute ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea ), the HPRD project ( http://www.hprd.org ), as well as many groups collected from diverse sources at NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), including protein-protein interactions and miRNA binding motifs 26 , 27 . Compilation of functional information from all of these sources and considering only gene groups of size 3–1,000 resulted in 23,810 partially redundant and overlapping functionally related gene groups. Enrichment of functional gene groups within various gene lists as described in the text was assessed by a standard hypergeometric test.

During the exploration of data for Fig. 2 , it was observed that there is significant correlation between the age and sex variables within the first 6 months of life ( r = 0.5). To ensure that this correlation was not responsible for the discoveries in Fig. 2 , the entire analysis was repeated while adjusting expression measures for sex. All the findings detailed in Fig. 2 were replicated in this verification analysis.

SNP-expression associations referred to in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6 were carried out using linear models that included surrogate variables generated as described above, age, life stage (as defined in Fig. 1b ), an interaction of age and life stage, sex, race, and the SNP under investigation. The SNP was included as a continuous variable, coded as 1,2,3; that is, an additive or ‘dosage’ model rather than a categorical or ‘co-dominant’ model was used. Association methods used to generate hits for the genetic distance used in Supplementary Fig. 2 , part 1, were identical to those described above except for the omission of the race and sex terms in the linear model. To confirm that this analytical framework is capable of discovering associations between genetic and transcriptional metrics as analysed here, we conducted a positive control analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 2 , part 2; negative control also included).
