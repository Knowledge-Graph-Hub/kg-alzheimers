Covarying alterations in Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume in cognitively normal elderly

# Abstract
β-amyloid (Aβ), a feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, may precede reduced glucose metabolism and gray matter volume and cognitive decline in AD patients. Accumulation of Aβ, however, has been also reported in cognitively intact older people, although it remains unresolved whether and how Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume relate to one another in cognitively normal elderly. Fifty-two cognitively normal older adults underwent Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET), [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and structural magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging to measure whole brain amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume, respectively. Covariance patterns of these measures in association with global amyloid burden measured by PIB index were extracted using principal component analysis-based multivariate methods. Higher global amyloid burden was associated with relative increases of amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism and relative decreases of gray matter volume in brain regions collectively known as the default mode network including the posterior cingulate/precuneus, lateral parietal cortices, and medial frontal cortex. Relative increases of amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism were also noted in the lateral prefrontal cortices, and relative decreases of gray matter volume were pronounced in hippocampus. The degree of expression of the topographical patterns of the PIB data was further associated with visual memory performance when controlling for age, sex, and education. The present findings suggest that cognitively normal older adults with greater amyloid deposition are relatively hypermetabolic in frontal and parietal brain regions while undergoing gray matter volume loss in overlapping brain regions.

## INTRODUCTION
Neuritic β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are a prominent biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology ( Braak & Braak, 1991 ). Events associated with Aβ deposition appear to include reduced glucose metabolism and brain atrophy, ultimately leading to dementia ( Hardy & Selkoe, 2002 ; Jack et al., 2010 ). Aβ deposition can be imaged in humans using amyloid binding ligands such as Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and positron emission tomography (PET). PIB-PET studies reported increased Aβ deposition in the frontal cortex, temporal cortices, parietal cortices, posterior cingulate and precuneus in AD patients compared to healthy elderly individuals ( Buckner et al., 2009 ; Buckner et al., 2005 ; Jack et al., 2008 ). Studies examining other biomarkers in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have further indicated that brain regions collectively known as the Default Mode Network (DMN), including highly interconnected cortical hubs ( Buckner, et al., 2009 ), undergo reduced functional connectivity ( Sorg et al., 2007 ), brain atrophy ( Buckner, et al., 2005 ; Dickerson et al., 2009 ), disrupted deactivation ( Sperling et al., 2009 ), and hypometabolism ( Chetelat et al., 2008 ; Minoshima et al., 1997 ).

Accumulation of Aβ has also been reported in approximately 20–30% of cognitively intact older people, although it remains unclear whether and how Aβ deposition and other biological measures relate to one another prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. Animal studies have shown that accumulation of Aβ is region-specific and relates to steady-state concentration of interstitial fluid (ISF) Aβ in brain regions early in life before plaque accumulation ( Bero et al., 2011 ; Yan et al., 2009 ) and that the amount of ISF Aβ is associated with regional neuronal activity ( Bero, et al., 2011 ). In humans, some studies have shown that region-specific Aβ accumulation spatially overlaps with brain regions showing aerobic glycolysis or higher fMRI signals indicating a positive relationship between amyloid deposition and metabolism ( Vaishnavi et al., 2010 ; Vlassenko et al., 2010 ) or brain activity ( Sperling, et al., 2009 ; Vaishnavi, et al., 2010 ; Vlassenko, et al., 2010 ). Other studies, however, show the relationship between amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism to be the same in normal aging and AD ( Drzezga et al., 2011 ). In addition, Aβ and brain atrophy are related in patients with AD and MCI ( Buckner, et al., 2005 ; Tosun, Schuff, Mathis, Jagust, & Weiner, 2011 ) and cognitively normal elderly ( Becker et al., 2011 ; Bourgeat et al., 2010 ; Mormino et al., 2009 ; Oh et al., 2011 ), but the degree of the overlapping topographic distribution between amyloid deposition and brain atrophy in aging is unclear.

In order to examine the regional patterns of Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume and their relationship with cognitive performance in aging, we applied a principal component analysis–based multivariate method, Scaled Subprofile Model (SSMPCA) to the analysis of [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, PIB-PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data ( Alexander & Moeller, 1994 ; Habeck et al., 2008 ). Specific aims were twofold. One was to examine whether and how topographical patterns of Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume relate to one another in cognitively normal elderly. The other was to examine whether the pattern of amyloid deposition or associated structural and functional change is associated with cognition.

## METHODS
Fifty-two healthy older adults (mean age = 74.1 ± 6.0 years, 34 females, mean MMSE = 29.1 ± 1.1) participated in the study ( Table 1 ). All subjects were a subgroup of individuals who were recruited from the community via newspaper advertisements and completed PIB-PET, FDG-PET, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. All subjects underwent a medical interview and a detailed battery of neuropsychological tests. In order to be eligible for the study, subjects were required to be 60 years or older, live independently in the community without neurological or psychiatric illness, and have no major medical illness or medication that influence cognition. In order to generate cognitive composite scores from neuropsychological tests, we utilized scores from a total of 254 cognitively intact older adults (mean age: 74.0 ± 7.4 years, range of age: 60–96 years, 167 females, mean MMSE = 28.6 ± 1.6) who underwent cognitive testing but did not undergo neuroimaging. All subjects provided informed consent in accordance with the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory prior to their participation.

All subjects underwent a detailed battery of neuropsychological tests that encompass multiple cognitive domains. The tests included Free Recall Trials 1–5 (FR 1–5), Short-Delay Free Recall (SDFR), Short-Delay Cued Recall (SDCR), Long-Delay Free Recall (LDFR), and Long-Delay Cued Recall (LDCR) of California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) II ( Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000 ), Stroop Test ( Golden, 1978 ), “Trail B” and “Trail B minus A” scores from Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B ( Reitan, 1958 ), Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( Smith, 1982 ), category “Vegetables” and “Animals” from Category Fluency Test ( Benton, Hamsher, & Sivan, 1983 ), Digit span forward and backward, Immediate Recall (VRI Recall Total), Delayed Recall (VRII Recall Total), Retention (VR % Retention) and Recognition (VR Recognition Total) from the Visual Reproduction (VR) Test in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III) ( Wechsler, 1997 ), and Recall of Story A and Story B from Logical Memory (WMS-III; Wechsler, 1997 ). In order to generate a composite score from neuropsychological tests, all test scores from subjects in the subject pool were entered into an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. Among factors extracted by the method, 5 factors that maximize the sum of variance explained were selected for the present study and based on the type of individual tests that express the highest factor loading scores for the factor. Each factor was named as follows: executive function (EXE), episodic memory (EM), semantic memory (SM), working memory (WM), and visual memory (VM). Subjects’ factor scores were entered in subsequent multiple regressions to examine the relationship with the degree of pattern expressions as quantified by subject scaling factors (SSF) in SSMPCA for Aβ deposition (“SSF-PIB”), glucose metabolism (“SSF-FDG”), and gray matter volume (“SSF-VBM”), respectively.

[ N -methyl- 11 C]-2-(4’-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ([ 11 C]PIB) was synthesized at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)’s Biomedical Isotope Facility using a previously published protocol ( Mathis et al., 2003 ). All PET scans were performed at LBNL using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR PET scanner in three-dimensional acquisition mode. Dynamic acquisition frames (total 34 frames) were obtained over 90 minutes as follows: 4 × 15 s, 8 × 30 s, 9 × 60 s, 2 × 180 s, 8 × 300 s and 3 × 600 s. Approximately 15mCi of [ 11 C]PIB was injected as a bolus into an antecubital vein.

[ 18 F] FDG was purchased from a commercial vendor (IBA Molecular, Morgan Hill, CA). At a minimum of 2 hours following 11 C-PIB injection, subjects were injected with 6 to 10mCi of [ 18 F] FDG. Six emission frames of 5 minutes each were acquired starting 30 minutes after tracer injection, with the subject resting quietly in a dimly lit room with eyes and ears unoccluded during tracer uptake.

For both PIB-PET and FDG-PET, ten minute transmission scans for attenuation correction were obtained either immediately prior to or following each 11 C-PIB and 18 F-FDG scan. PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation. Images were smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter correction.

High-resolution structural MRI scans were collected at LBNL on a 1.5 T Magnetom Avanto system (Siemens Inc., Iselin, NJ) with a 12 channel head coil run in triple mode. Three high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPPAGE) scans were collected axially for each subject (TR = 2110 ms, TE = 3.58 ms, flip angle: 15°, field of view = 256 × 256 mm, matrix size: 256 × 256 mm, slices: 160, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 ).

All PET images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ). Region of Interest (ROI) labeling was implemented using the FreeSurfer v4.4 software package ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) in order to create reference regions in the gray matter cerebellum and pons and to perform subsequent ROI analyses.

The first five PIB frames were summed and all PIB frames including the summed image from 1–5 frames were realigned to the middle (17 th ) frame. The subject’s structural MRI image was coregistered to realigned PIB frames. PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated on a voxelwise level using Logan graphical analysis and the subject’s gray matter cerebellar reference region with frames corresponding to 35–90 min post-injection ( Logan et al., 1996 ; Price et al., 2005 ). DVR images warped to the MNI template were smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.

Six frames of FDG-PET were realigned using the first frame as a reference and a mean FDG image was generated. The FDG PET mean image was coregistered to the mean PIB PET image, followed by coregistration of the subject’s structural MRI image (and associated MRI defined reference regions) to the mean FDG image. This resulted in having FDG and PIB images in the same space for subsequent analysis. The realigned FDG frames were summed across frames and the summed image was intensity normalized on a voxel-wise level to the mean value of the pons. Pons-normalized FDG images were warped to an MNI structural template via the subject's MRI and smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.

We performed VBM implemented with SPM8 running under Matlab 7.7 (Mathworks, Natick, MA) on structural images. VBM is a semi-automated iterative procedure in which implementations of tissue classification, bias correction, and nonlinear warping are combined. Details can be found in the previously published report ( Oh, et al., 2011 ). Briefly, the VBM procedure implemented in the present study included segmentation, normalization, modulation, and smoothing steps. First, an averaged single structural T1 image for each subject was segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) using GM, WM, and CSF tissue probability maps (TPM) provided by SPM8. Segmented GM and WM were then spatially normalized to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) GM and WM templates using the 12-parameter affine transformation ( Ashburner, Neelin, Collins, Evans, & Friston, 1997 ) and nonlinear registration ( Ashburner & Friston, 1999 ). Warped images were then modulated by the Jacobian determinants derived from the spatial normalization step in order to adjust for the resulting volume changes due to warping ( Good et al., 2001 ). Modulated warped images were smoothed with a 12-mm Gaussian kernel at the full-width and half-maximum (FWHM). Total intracranial volume (TIV) was calculated by summing volumes of GM, WM, and CSF derived from segmented images in native space.

For all subjects, an averaged single structural T1 image was processed through Freesurfer v4.4 to implement region of interest (ROI) labeling. Details can be found in the previously published report ( Oh, et al., 2011 ). Briefly, structural images were bias field corrected, intensity normalized, and skull stripped using a watershed algorithm, followed by a white matter-based segmentation, defining gray/white matter and pial surfaces, and topology correction ( Dale, Fischl, & Sereno, 1999 ; Fischl, Liu, & Dale, 2001 ; Segonne et al., 2004 ). Subcortical and cortical ROIs spanning the entire brain were defined in each subject’s native space ( Desikan et al., 2006 ; Fischl et al., 2002 ). The resulting cerebellum ROI (gray matter only) was used as a reference region to create a PIB-DVR image. The resulting brainstem ROI by the Freesurfer processing stream was manually edited to generate a pons ROI that was used to normalize FDG data for each individual. Large cortical ROIs spanning frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyri were constructed as previously described ( Oh, et al., 2011 ). Mean DVR values from these large ROIs constituted a global PIB index for each subject.

To extract covarying patterns in PIB, FDG, and VBM data that are associated with PIB index of each subject, we applied Scaled Subprofile Modeling (SSM) analysis to the preprocessed PIB, FDG, and VBM data using SPM 5 on Matlab version 7.4 (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA). As a modified form of principal component analysis (PCA), SSM identifies spatial covariance patterns that are associated with a variable of interest (i.e., PIB index in the present study) on a voxel basis across the whole brain. The assumptions and procedures of the SSM have been described in detail in previous studies ( Alexander et al., 2008 ; Alexander & Moeller, 1994 ; Habeck & Stern, 2010 ; Moeller, Strother, Sidtis, & Rottenberg, 1987 ). Briefly, prior to principal component (PC) extraction, the gray matter mask with a threshold > 0.4 was applied to the PIB-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM data in order to include voxels that are most likely gray matter. This procedure assures that the same gray matter map was used throughout three imaging modalities. Then, we subtracted group mean voxel values across regions and participants from the raw values at each voxel for each participant for each modality. This step effectively normalizes each voxel for total brain measures and subject mean differences before the PCA. Thus, SSM extracts the variance reflecting the region by subject interaction in the imaging data after removing the main effects for global brain measures and subject differences on a voxel basis ( Alexander et al., 2006 ). For the PIB-PET and FDG-PET data, brain volume ratio that was calculated by the sum of gray and white matter divided by the total intracranial volume (TIV) was entered as a nuisance covariate in the regression analyses in order to account for effects of brain atrophy. These regression models were applied to select a combination of PCs in association with PIB index. TIV was entered as a nuisance covariate in the regression analysis for the VBM data in order to eliminate the main effect of head size.

We performed separate SSMPCAs on PIB-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM data to identify patterns of Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume related to global PIB index characterizing overall Aβ deposition across the whole brain regions in cognitively intact normal elderly. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) were applied to identify the best set of SSM component patterns predicting a global PIB index ( Akaike, 1973 ). After applying AIC to determine the PCs to be included, non-parametric regression with 10,000 permutations (i.e., permutation tests in the text below) were implemented to test the hypothesis of a significant relationship between PIB index and covariance patterns of PIB-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM data. The relationship was evaluated at p < .05. In addition, a bootstrap resampling procedure was implemented to estimate the variability of the regional weights in the patterns about their point estimate values with a 500 iteration resampling procedure with replacement ( Habeck et al., 2005 ). A Z-value threshold ≥ | 1 | for FDG-PET and VBM data and a Z-value threshold ≥ | 3 | for PIB-PET data were adopted purely for visualization purposes to show the full extent of brain regions contributing to the combined SSM pattern. It is important to note that bootstrapping was conducted in order to estimate voxel-wise variability, which is analogous to univariate approaches, and the resulting statistics are not for hypothesis testing unlike the permutation tests that were adopted to test hypotheses about the association between PIB index and covariance patterns.

All non-image analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 19). Multiple regressions were used to assess the relationship between the degree of pattern expression as quantified by the subject scaling factors (SSFs) and cognitive performance. That is, we conducted multiple regressions for a total of 3 pattern expression scores (i.e., SSF-PIB, SSF-FDG, and SSF-VBM) and 5 cognitive factor scores (i.e., EM, VM, EXE, SM, and WM) with each SSF score being a predictor of interest and each cognitive factor score being a dependent measure, resulting in 15 regression models. Age, sex, and education were controlled in all analyses. Statistical significance was determined at p < .05.

## RESULTS
Subject characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Factor analysis on neuropsychological measures revealed 5 components (i.e., EXE, EM, SM, WM, and VM) that accounted for 77.1 % of the total variance of the data. Higher factor loadings were weighted on CVLT subtests and Logical Memory for EM; visual reproduction subtests for VM; category fluency subtests for SM; digit span subtests for WM; and Trail Making subtests and Stroop for EXE. Due to the nature of factor analysis, however, all neuropsychological test scores contributed to each factor score to a varying degree.

The association between the global PIB index and Aβ deposition topography was tested by a multiple regression model with SSM subject factor scores for the 8 component patterns selected by AIC. The linear combination of the selected 8 PCs (i.e., PCs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10) accounted for 98 % of the variance in the PIB data (i.e., R 2 = 0.98), and the permutation test showed that the patterns of a linear combination of PCs significantly predicted the PIB index, p < .001. The identified covariance pattern of the PIB data in association with a global PIB index is presented in Figure 1A and the relation between SSF-PIB and PIB index is shown in Figure 2A . Peak coordinates of suprathreshold clusters are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Figure 1A and Table 2 , relatively reduced amyloid deposition indicated by voxels with negative loadings, corresponding to PIB-related decreases in values, was identified in the hippocampus bilaterally and visual and motor cortex. Regions with positive loadings, indicating PIB-related increases in values, were observed in the medial frontal cortex, temporoparietal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and precuneus. In Figure 2A , greater expression of the covariance pattern of the PIB data as evidenced by higher SSF scores was significantly associated with higher overall PIB deposition.

A linear combination of 2 component patterns (i.e., PCs 3 and 12) selected by AIC significantly predicted PIB index, R 2 = 0.15, p < .05. Figure 1B shows the FDG pattern in association with the PIB index and Figure 2B illustrates the significant association between PIB index and SSF-FDG. The pattern for glucose metabolism associated with increased Aβ deposition was characterized by relative decreases in the inferior medial frontal cortex, lateral and medial temporal cortex, anterior cingulate, and visual cortex and relative increases in the lateral prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and precuneus. Table 3 lists peak coordinates of suprathreshold clusters.

Figure 1C shows the topographic pattern of gray matter volume in relation to the PIB index and Table 4 shows the list of peak coordinates of suprathreshold clusters. The association between component (i.e., PC 4) pattern scores and the PIB index showed a trend towards significance, R 2 = 0.04, p = 0.10 ( Figure 2C ). A topographic pattern of gray matter volume in association with the PIB index was characterized by negative loadings in the medial frontal, lateral temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices and hippocampus and positive loadings in the superior frontal, primary sensory/motor and visual cortices as illustrated in Figure 1C .

We evaluated the association between SSF scores and cognitive performance measured by factor scores using multiple regressions. Multiple regressions showed a significant association between SSF-PIB and visual memory, β = −.30, p < .05, indicating that a greater expression of the amyloid deposition pattern is related to worse visual memory. No association was found for either SSF-FDG or SSF-VBM and any other cognitive measures. The relationship between SSF-PIB scores and visual memory is illustrated in Figure 3 .

## DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined covariance patterns of Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume that are associated with Aβ in order to elucidate the topographical relationships between these processes in cognitively normal older adults. Covariance patterns for each modality in relation to a global PIB index strikingly corresponded with each other in their spatial extent. The directionality between Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume, however, was different from that reported in patients with clinical symptoms of AD. Unlike AD patients who show hypometabolism along with higher Aβ deposition in brain regions that are considered to be vulnerable to AD pathology, cognitively intact older adults with higher levels of Aβ deposition showed relative increases of both glucose metabolism and Aβ deposition in overlapping brain regions, the posterior cingulate/precuneus and lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices in particular. Gray matter volume changes in relation to Aβ deposition, however, were consistent with previous findings showing greater gray matter volume reduction in brain regions susceptible to AD pathology.

Hypometabolism and Aβ deposition have been considered as pathological characteristics of AD and MCI ( Minoshima, et al., 1997 ; Silverman et al., 2001 ), particularly in brain regions involving the default mode network ( Buckner, et al., 2005 ; Edison et al., 2007 ; Klunk et al., 2004 ). The PIB pattern identified by SSMPCA in the present study reflects what other studies have shown about the regional deposition of β-amyloid, by displaying increased PIB binding in the precuneus, lateral parietal cortices, medial and lateral frontal cortices. Regional topography of atrophy in the present study is also consistent with previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that have indicated prominent brain atrophy in AD particularly in the medial temporal lobe, the lateral temporoparietal cortex and basal temporal lobe ( Jack, et al., 2008 ; Jack et al., 2009 ). Some brain regions, notably inferomedial temporal cortex also showed atrophy and hypometabolism in the absence of Aβ deposition. The present findings of topographical patterns of amyloid deposition and gray matter volume reduction in association with global PIB index indicate that brain regions known to be susceptible to AD pathology undergo both increased amyloid deposition and gray matter reduction in normal aging, while some regions express hypometabolism as well.

Aβ deposition clearly occurs in older people without clinical symptoms ( Aizenstein et al., 2008 ; Bennett et al., 2006 ). Compared to the findings in AD patients, however, the relationship between Aβ deposition and other AD-related biomarkers is not as clear in cognitively normal older adults. For example, the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele is associated with increased risk of AD, glucose hypometabolism in typically vulnerable regions in asymptomatic people ( Reiman et al., 2004 ), and subsequent memory decline ( Caselli et al., 2004 ). Although this suggests that metabolic changes in cognitively normal people with AD vulnerability may parallel those seen in AD subjects, Cohen et al. (2009) have shown that glucose metabolism is higher with greater Aβ in these same brain regions in MCI patients. Therefore, although limited, emerging literature seems to suggest a possible positive relationship between metabolism and Aβ accumulation in brain regions that are known to be susceptible to AD pathology before severe clinical AD symptoms appear.

Hypometabolism in relation to Aβ accumulation has been widely interpreted as evidence of disrupted neuronal functions and synaptic activity. Causes of relatively increased glucose metabolism in relation to higher level of Aβ accumulation, however, are not clear. One possible explanation may be activated microglia found within and immediately surrounding maturing amyloid plaques ( Itagaki, McGeer, Akiyama, Zhu, & Selkoe, 1989 ). Aβ-related microgliosis, astrocytosis, and the overproduction and release of various inflammatory mediators may explain the increased level of glucose metabolism ( Fellin et al., 2004 ; Palop & Mucke, 2010 ; Vezzani & Granata, 2005 ). Another possibility is an increase of the abnormally hyperactive neurons in cortical circuits ( Abramov et al., 2009 ; Busche et al., 2008 ; Palop & Mucke, 2009 ; Puzzo et al., 2008 ; Vezzani & Granata, 2005 ). Another possible mechanism may be altered ionic homeostasis, particularly excessive calcium entry into neurons and increases in astroglial calcium ions ( Selkoe, 2001 ). All these possibilities are considered as metabolic consequences of increased accumulation of Aβ.

Functional associations may also explain the associations between Aβ deposition and higher metabolism, indirect measures of increased neural activity that leads to overproduction of Aβ. Direct evidence of the causal relation between neural activity and production of Aβ has been provided in animal studies ( Bero, et al., 2011 ; Cirrito et al., 2005 ; Kamenetz et al., 2003 ; Kang et al., 2009 ). The associations between higher metabolism and Aβ deposition seen in MCI patients ( Cohen et al., 2009 ) are also consistent with a view that higher basal metabolism may lead to acceleration of amyloid deposition. Studies using fMRI have also reported increased brain activation in MCI subjects ( Dickerson et al., 2005 ) or PIB-positive normal controls compared to PIB-negative normal controls (Mormino et al., 2011; Sperling et al., 2009 ; for a review, Jagust & Mormino, 2011). Buckner et al. (2009) also showed that brain regions accumulating greater level of amyloid as evidenced in AD patients correspond to functional hubs identified by increased functional connectivity with other brain regions compared to the rest of the brain. The identified functional hubs include medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, lateral frontal and parietal regions and highly overlap with brain regions that show relative increase in metabolism in our results. Therefore, although metabolism, increased fMRI signal, functional connectivity, and neuronal activity may measure different aspects of brain function, a very similar topography between brain regions expressing a higher level of these functional measures and those accumulating greater amyloid deposition implicates an underlying neural mechanism that relates these phenomena. Direct causal mechanisms of increased metabolism in relation to Aβ accumulation in our results, however, cannot be resolved based on the current cross-sectional data. In addition, it is possible that increases in glucose metabolism are compensatory in nature, and play a role in permitting older individuals to remain cognitively normal in the face of Aβ deposition ( Kadir et al., 2012 ).

The regional variability seen in the covariance patterns of PIB, FDG, and VBM data raises the question of whether there is any laterality difference in these patterns. When we counted the number of voxels with negative and positive loadings for each hemisphere, there was little laterality difference, although voxels with negative loadings were slightly left-lateralized with PIB and right-lateralized with FDG covariance patterns. Due to a lack of significance testing, it is not clear whether this trend of laterality bears any significance, but future studies may examine laterality effects in regional topography of these biomarkers in relation to global amyloid deposition.

Due to the nature of the cross-sectional data in the present study and the relative nature of the biological measures defined by the multivariate approach, however, it is uncertain whether the relative increases in metabolism associated with Aβ will be linked to the later development of AD. Moreover, the present results do not indicate absolute increases in glucose metabolism in association with higher amyloid deposition. The covariance analysis approach we took is designed to account for global signal in brain activity and variability in brain function among individuals that usually obscures the regional topographic patterns of interest ( Alexander & Moeller, 1994 ). The SSMPCA approach allowed us to examine subject-region interactions that can be clinically and/or biologically relevant but represent small effects. Therefore, the relative increases or decreases in covariance patterns identified by the multivariate analysis method are particularly useful when the effect is subtle and distributed and thereby cannot be localized to a few key regions using more traditional univariate approaches. This is relevant to the present results since pattern scores were significantly correlated with the PIB index while voxel-based Z scores of FDG and VBM covariance maps in association with the PIB index were quite low. These Z-maps on a voxel basis underscore the need for multivariate analysis when the effect can be captured through covariance patterns across widespread regions.

It is crucial to understand the relationship between Aβ-induced alterations at different levels of analysis: at synapses, circuits, networks, and cognition in order to determine what aspect of neuronal dysfunction is most directly related to cognitive decline. The present data indicate that the pattern of Aβ accumulation is related to cognitive performance measured in visual memory while neither the Aβ-dependent pattern of glucose metabolism nor that of gray matter volume accounts for individual differences in cognition during normal aging.

The effect of Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume on cognition in normal aging is not resolved. Some studies have shown no difference in gray matter volume and episodic memory scores between the elderly with high PIB and those with low PIB ( Bourgeat, et al., 2010 ). Others have reported poorer cognition, episodic memory in particular, in relation to Aβ deposition during normal aging ( Oh, Madison, Haight, Markley, & Jagust, 2012 ; Pike et al., 2007 ; Villemagne et al., 2008 ). By correlating subject scaling factor scores, a single measure representing a degree of expression of the covariance pattern, with cognitive factor scores, we further sought to elucidate whether individual differences in cognition can be explained by the degree of expression of the patterns that were formed due to Aβ deposition. A significant association between the degree of the covariance pattern of Aβ deposition and visual memory provides support for an effect of Aβ on episodic memory, although limited to visual domains, among cognitively normal elderly. With regard to the FDG covariance patterns, there was no association between the degree of expression of the covariance pattern and cognition. This result may indicate that relatively increased metabolism in the brain regions accumulating greater Aβ reflects increased neural activity that may compensate for a deteriorating effect of Aβ on cognition. Conversely, it is also possible that some people have higher resting metabolism than others in order to perform equivalently on cognitive tests, leading to amyloid deposition. Although the current results cannot resolve this issue, future studies are warranted to directly test the temporal sequences of changes in metabolism and amyloid deposition across the lifespan.
