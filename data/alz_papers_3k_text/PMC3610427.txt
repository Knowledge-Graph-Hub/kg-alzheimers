# Title
Amyloid-binding compounds maintain protein homeostasis during ageing and extend lifespan

# Abstract
Genetic studies indicate that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to metazoan longevity 1 . Collapse of protein homeostasis results in protein misfolding cascades and the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids 2 . A group of small molecules, traditionally used in histopathology to stain amyloid in tissues, bind protein fibrils and slow aggregation in vitro and in cell culture 3 , 4 . We proposed that treating animals with such compounds would promote protein homeostasis in vivo and increase longevity. Here we show that exposure of adult Caenorhabditis elegans to the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin T (ThT) resulted in a profoundly extended lifespan and slowed ageing. ThT also suppressed pathological features of mutant metastable proteins and human β-amyloid-associated toxicity. These beneficial effects of ThT depend on the protein homeostasis network regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the stress resistance and longevity transcription factor SKN-1, molecular chaperones, autophagy and proteosomal functions. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological maintenance of the protein homeostatic network has a profound impact on ageing rates, prompting the development of novel therapeutic interventions against ageing and age-related diseases.

## METHODS
Strains were cultured under standard laboratory conditions in USP agar. Strains used in this work include N2, HE250 [ unc-52(e669su250)II ], CB1157 [ unc-54(e1157)I ], CF1038 [ daf-16(mu86)I ], DA465 [ eat-2(ad465)II ], TJ1052 [ age-1(hx546)II ], PS3551 [ hsf-1(sy441)I ], TJ356 [zIs356 IV (daf-16::daf-16-gfp; pRF4 (rol-6(su1006))], CL4176 [ dvIs27[myo-3::Aβ (3–42) -let 3′UTR(pAF29) ; pRF4 (rol-6(su1006)) ], AM140 ( rmIs132[P(unc-54) Q35::YFP ]), ZZ26 ( unc-63(x26)I ), CW152 ( gas-1(fc21) X ), CF2189 ( Is001[skn-1::gfp rol-6(su1006 )]).

Lifespan assays were performed as described previously 24 . Briefly, the nematode growth media (NGM, USP agar) plates were prepared under sterile conditions. One-hundred microlitres of concentrated stocks of each of the compounds used in this study were added onto a previously prepared NGM small plate (3 ml volume) immediately spread over the surface of the plate. The final concentrations quoted in the text assume an even distribution of compound throughout the 3 ml of agar in the plate. The plates were then placed in a laminar flow hood at room temperature (22 °C) for 30 min and then 60 μl of a concentrated suspension of E. coli OP50 was spotted to form a circular lawn on the centre of each plate. Thirty late L4 larvae growing at 20 °C were transferred to fresh NGM plates with FUdR (75 μM, unless otherwise stated) in the presence or absence of the specified compounds and incubated at 20 °C. The first day of adulthood is day 3 in survival curves. We noted between-experiment variation in the magnitude of the lifespan extension observed with ThT, which appeared to correlate with different suppliers and batches. ThT concentration should be optimized depending on batch and purity and stability of the compound. We noted that a darkening in the appearance of the stock resulted in loss of lifespan extension activity and even early death. The optimal range for lifespan extension was between 25 and 75 μM.

Nematodes were scored as alive, dead or lost every second day. Nematodes that failed to display touch-provoked movement were scored as dead. Nematodes that died from causes other than ageing, such as sticking to the plate walls, internal hatching of eggs (‘bagging’) or gonadal extrusion were censored as were lost worms. Nematodes were transferred to fresh plates every 3–6 days. All lifespan experiments were performed at 20 °C unless otherwise stated. Survival curves were plotted and statistical analyses (log-rank test) were performed using Prism 4 software (Graphpad Software).

Plates were prepared as described 25 but bacterial concentration was adjusted to 1.0 × 10 12 c.f.u. ml −1 and diluted to achieve a bacterial concentration of 1.0 × 10 9 c.f.u. ml −1 . Diluted bacterial cultures were spotted onto dietary restriction agar plates, which were modified from the standard nematode growth media (NGM) plates by excluding peptone and increasing agar from 1.7% to 2.0%. Carbenicillin (50 mg ml −1 ) was added to the agar plates to further prevent bacterial growth. Synchronized L4 larvae grown under standard laboratory conditions (NGM plates with OP50 food, 20 °C) were transferred to fresh dietary restriction agar plates in the presence or absence of 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM ThT, and lifespans scored as described earlier.

Estimates of initial mortality rate and rate of increase with age and model fitting were made using WinModest. Gompertz mortality curves, ln(ux) = ln(a) + bx, where ux defines the age-specific hazard, were fitted with log-likelihood ratios used to examined the effects of constraining the intercept (a) or gradient (b) variables.

Populations of CL4176 dvIs2[pCL12(unc-54/human Aβ 3–42 minigene) + pRF4] or AM140 ( rmIs132[P(unc-54) Q35:YFP] ) worms were grown at 20 °C for 48 h and then exposed to 50 μM ThT and 100 μM curcumin at 25 °C in presence of FUdR (10 μg ml −1 ) for AM140. Scoring for paralysis was initiated 2 and 8 days after temperature upshift for CL4176 and AM140, respectively. Nematodes were scored as paralysed if they failed to move during observation and exhibited ‘halos’ of cleared bacteria around their heads (indicative of insufficient body movement to access food), eggs accumulated close to the body or if they failed to respond to a touch-provoked movement with a platinum wire. For sensitivity to ethanol or levamisole resistance, CW152 gas-1(fc21 X) and ZZ26 ( unc-63(x26)I ) worms were picked into 0.4 M ethanol or 50 μM levamisole, respectively, equilibrated for 5 min, and scored for paralysis as described earlier. Treated and untreated worms were compared with an unpaired t -test (implemented in Prism 4, Graphpad Software).

For fluorescent microscopy, TJ356 [zIs356 IV (daf-16::daf-16-gfp; pRF4 (rol-6(su1006))] or CF2189 Is001(skn-1::gfp + rol-6(su1006)) nematodes were paralysed with 1 mM levamisole mounted on 1% agarose pads and imaged using Olympus BX51 (×60 objective) and HCImage software (Hamamatsu). For positive controls, TJ356 worms were exposed for 3 h to 33 °C and CF2189 worms were exposed to 5 mM NaAsO 2 for 15 min. For immunofluorescence, N2, HE250 unc-52 (e669su250), CB1157 unc-54 (e1157) or CL4176 dvIs27[myo-3::Aβ (3–42) -let 3′UTR(pAF29); pRF4 (rol-6(su1006))] worms were treated for 24–36 h with or without 50 μM ThT at 25 °C. After this period the worms were collected, rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After fixation, worms were rinsed twice with 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and then permeabilized by 24 h exposure to β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C followed by collagenase treatment (2 mg ml −1 for 1–1.5 h at 37 °C) to allow for digestion of the cuticle. Paramyosin and perlecans were detected with primary monoclonal antibodies 5-23 and MH3 (developed by H. Epstein and R. H. Waterston and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology) and AlexaFluor 633 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibody. Soluble oligomers and amyloid-β peptide were detected with anti polyclonal A11 (Invitrogen) and 6E10 monoclonal (Covance) primary antibiodies, respectively, with AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-rabbit and AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) as secondary anti-bodies. Image analysis was performed in Image Analyst MKII 2.0.49 (Image Analyst Software) as follows. Aggregates were counted by image segmentation. To this end, wide-field epifluorescence and confocal micrographs were pre-processed by high pass Butterworth filtering at ω cuton = 0.85 cycles μm −1 (order 1.5) to amplify small (<1.2 μm) punctate details, smoothed by Wiener filtering and rescaled with a gamma level 0.7. Image segmentation was performed by a modified Watershed method from seeds defined by being brighter than the 99.9 percentile of the rescaled image. Pixels brighter than 10% of the peak intensity for each aggregate were taken as positive. Because the high-pass filtering subtracts local mean, the segmentation resulted in objects outlined close to their original half maximal intensities, and therefore the size of segmented objects truly reflected the size of the aggregates. Objects larger than 30 pixels (0.56 μm 2 ) were rejected. The high-pass filtering also eliminated the blur of wide-field images, therefore these images were handled in the same way as confocal images. Images of different conditions were handled with the same algorithm, and no subjective threshold levels were applied. The number of aggregates was determined in same-size areas close to the vulva of at least 10 worms under the same conditions.

We explored ThT distribution and potential colocalization with proteins prone to aggregate by using two-photon excitation of ThT at 800 nm and emission at 435–485 nm in combination with anti-oligomers and amyloid-β peptide immunodetection described earlier. In this spectral range worms exhibited negligible autofluorescence, therefore the signal was highly specific for ThT. Considering that image acquisition was performed after immunostaining probably only the protein-bound form of ThT was imaged. Pearson’s coefficient values for ThT and amyloid-β were calculated by using Image Analyst MKII 2.0.49 (Image Analyst Software).

Peptide corresponding to amino acids 110–145 (NLSEDGKL SIEAPKKEAVQGRSIPIQQAIVEEKSAE) of HSP-16.2 was used to commercially synthesize antiserum (Invitrogen). Briefly, KLH-peptide was emulsified by mixing with an equal volume of Freund’s adjuvant and injected into three subcutaneous dorsal sites for a total of 0.1 mg of peptide for immunization. The animals (rabbits) were bled, the blood allowed to clot and the serum collected by centrifugation. Monoclonal HSP-70 and polyclonal HSF-1 primary antibodies were from Stressgen (N27F3-4 and SPA-901, respectively).

For immunoblot analysis, 3-day-old adult hermaphrodites were treated with 50 μM ThT or 100 μM curcumin as described earlier and replicates of 25 nematodes were collected for each treatment. Worms were transferred to siliconized eppendorf tubes, washed once in S-basal and frozen in liquid N 2 . Standard SDS–PAGE was performed using (4–12%) NOVEX gels and MES running buffer. Following transfer PVDF (BioRad) membranes were incubated with antisera (1:10,000) or primary antibodies (1:1,000) diluted in blocking buffer and then with secondary, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce), diluted 1:25,000. Detection was undertaken with chemiluminescent reagents (SuperSignal, Pierce) and standard autoradiography.

RNAi bacterial strains expressing double-stranded RNA that inactivates specified genes were cultured and used as previously described 26 . Briefly, eggs isolated from synchronous populations of cultures were placed on fresh RNAi plates and allowed to grow at 15 °C; 3 days later, L4 moult nematodes were transferred to new plates seeded with the same bacteria in the presence or absence of compounds and switched to 25 °C. In all cases, 1 mM isopropyl- b - d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used for induction of doublestranded RNA. In all cases the identity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing.

Twelve single adults from control or 50 μM ThT populations were picked after 3, 6 and 12 days of treatment into 5 μl of distilled water and flash frozen until extraction. Individual worms were extracted and analysed on the QIAcube robot as described previously 27 . The housekeeping genes gpd-1 and gpd-4 were found to have invariant steady-state levels across treatments and were used to derive calibrated normalized relative quantities (CNRQs) for each gene of interest as previously described 27 .
