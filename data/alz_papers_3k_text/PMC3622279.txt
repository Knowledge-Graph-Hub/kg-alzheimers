Exposure to Particulate Air Pollution and Cognitive Decline in Older
Women

# Abstract
Chronic exposure to particulate air pollution may accelerate
cognitive decline in older adults, although data on this association are
limited. Our objective was to examine long-term exposure to particulate
matter (PM) air pollution, both coarse ([PM 2.5–10
μm in diameter [PM 2.5-10 ]) and fine (PM
<2.5 μm in diameter [PM 2.5 ]), in
relation to cognitive decline. The study population comprised the Nurses’ Health Study
Cognitive Cohort, which included 19 409 US women aged 70 to 81 years. We
used geographic information system–based spatiotemporal smoothing
models to estimate recent (1 month) and long-term (7–14 years)
exposures to PM 2.5-10 , and PM 2.5 preceding base-line
cognitive testing (1995–2001) of participants residing in the
contiguous United States. We used generalized estimating equation regression
to estimate differences in the rate of cognitive decline across levels of
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 exposures. The main outcome
measure was cognition, via validated telephone assessments, administered 3
times at approximately 2-year intervals, including tests of general
cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, working memory, and
attention. Higher levels of long-term exposure to both PM 2.5-10 and
PM 2.5 were associated with significantly faster cognitive
decline. Two-year decline on a global score was 0.020 (95% CI,
−0.032 to −0.008) standard units worse per 10
μg/m 3 increment in PM 2.5-10 exposure and
0.018 (95% CI, −0.035 to −0.002) units worse per 10
μg/m 3 increment in PM 2.5 exposure. These
differences in cognitive trajectory were similar to those between women in
our cohort who were approximately 2 years apart in age, indicating that the
effect of a 10-μg/m 3 increment in long-term PM exposure
is cognitively equivalent to aging by approximately 2 years. Long-term exposure to PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 at
levels typically experienced by many individuals in the United States is
associated with significantly worse cognitive decline in older women.

## METHODS
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) began in 1976 when 121 700 female
registered nurses, aged 30 to 55 years and living in 11 US states, returned a mailed
questionnaire about their medical history and health-related behaviors. 23 Since then, women have completed
questionnaires every 2 years. To date, we have maintained follow-up of more than
90% of the original participants. This study was approved by the
institutional review board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston,
Massachusetts.

From 1995 to 2001, we invited participants 70 years and older with no
history of stroke to participate in a study of cognition. Of the 22 715 women
who were eligible, we were unable to contact 1031 (4.5%). Of those
remaining, 7.7% declined participation. Our analyses of exposure to
coarse PM (2.5–10 μm in diameter
[PM 2.5-10 ]) and PM 2.5 in relation to
cognitive decline were based on data from up to 19 409 women with relevant data.
Second (1997–2004) and third (2002–2008) cognitive assessments
were administered a mean (SD) of 1.9 (0.4) years (n=17 089) and 4.3
(0.8) years (n=14204) after initial testing, reflecting at least
83% participation at each follow-up cycle.

We used geographic information system (GIS)-based spatiotemporal
smoothing models to estimate exposures to PM 10 (<10 μm in
diameter) and PM 2.5 for women residing in the contiguous United
States. Coarse PM (PM 2.5-10 ) was the difference between
PM 10 and PM 2.5 . The methods for estimating these
exposures for a 13-state region have been described previously. 24 – 26 These methods have been extended to
estimate PM 10 and PM 2.5 for the contiguous United States.
Briefly, PM 10 and PM 2.5 monitor data were obtained from
the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) Air Quality System
(AQS). 26 – 28 Monitor data on
PM 10 were available nationwide from 1988 through 2007. Monitor
data on PM 2.5 were not widely available before 1999. Thus, separate
PM 2.5 models were developed for the pre-1999 and post-1999
periods, as in previous work. 26 The pre-1999 PM 2.5 model described seasonal
spatial and monthly temporal patterns in the PM 2.5 to PM 10 ratio; we multiplied this ratio by PM 10 to obtain PM 2.5 predictions during this earlier period. Generalized additive mixed models were
constructed to explain variation in measured PM 10 and
PM 2.5 (post-1999) levels as the sum of effects of GIS-derived
covariates (eg, distance to nearest road by road class, urban land use),
meteorological data, and smooth spatial terms. These models were used with
GIS-derived and meteorological data specific to each geocoded residential
location for each nurse, to provide highly spatially resolved estimates of
monthly PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations.

We averaged month-specific exposures to PM 2.5-10 ,
PM 2.5 , and PM 10 over several intervals preceding the
initial cognitive interview: preceding month, year, 2 years, 5 years, and from
1988 through the preceding month. (See the eFigure and eAppendix 1 for further detail on
PM exposure models and exposure estimation, and the timing of exposure and
cognitive assessments; http://www.archinternmed.com .)

Cognitive testing was administered using validated telephone interviews.
In the initial interviewing, we administered only the Telephone Interview for
Cognitive Status (TICS) 29 and
gradually added 5 more tests as high participation in the cognitive testing
became apparent. Thus, the sample size differs somewhat across the cognitive
tests, although participation rates remained identical for all tests. The TICS
(n=19 409) is modeled on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and
scores on the 2 tests are strongly correlated (Pearson correlation,
0.94). 29 A test of
delayed recall of the 10-word list from the TICS (N=16 908) was one of
the 5 tests added to our battery. We also added the East Boston Memory Test
(EBMT) 30 , 31 to assess immediate (n=18 662)
and delayed (=18 635) paragraph recall. We administered a test of
category fluency in which participants were asked to name as many animals as
they could in 1 minute 32 (n=18 652). Finally, participants were administered the Digit Span
Backward test 33 (n=16
916), measuring working memory and attention. We used the full testing battery
in the second and third assessment waves.

Our 2 prespecified primary outcomes were composite measures of
cognition. 5 , 34 Specifically, to summarize the overall
association of the air pollution exposure measures with cognitive performance,
for women given all 6 tests (n=16 887), we constructed a global score by
averaging z scores from all tests. In addition, to assess
overall verbal memory, a strong predictor of developing AD, 35 we combined the immediate and delayed
recalls of the EBMT and the TICS 10-word list, for women given all 4 tests
(n=16 906), by averaging z scores from these tests. We
extensively tested the reliability and validity of our telephone procedure for
assessing cognition in high functioning, educated women ( eAppendix 2 ).

We performed separate analyses for each of the PM measures, evaluating
exposures in quintiles and as continuous variables, in relation to each
cognitive score, including the verbal and global scores. All individual test
scores were expressed as z scores, computed from the means and
standard deviations in our study population. We compared trajectories in
cognitive function over the 3 repeated measures across levels of the exposure
measures, using generalized estimating equations regression models, 36 which allowed us to account
for the correlations among repeated cognitive scores. In these models, we
included terms for time, in years, since baseline cognitive assessment (as a
continuous variable), air pollution exposure, and cross-products between the
time and air pollution exposure terms. We adjusted these analyses for potential
confounding variables, including age at cognitive assessment, education
(registered nurse degree, bachelor’s degree, or advanced graduate
degree), husband’s education (high school diploma or less, college
degree, advanced graduate degree, or other), energy expended on recreational
physical activity 37 (mean of
responses to 4–7 questionnaires from 1986 through initial cognitive
assessment, in quartiles), and alcohol consumption (mean of responses to
5–8 questionnaires from 1986 through initial cognitive assessment; none,
up to 1 drink/wk, 2–6 drinks/wk, or ≥1 drink/d). We also
included terms for the cross-products between each covariate and time.
Additional adjustment for body mass index, diabetes, smoking (status and
pack-years), aspirin use (3 frequency categories), and ibuprofen use
(ever/never), did not change our findings. We conducted tests for linear trend
across the PM quintiles using an ordinal variable that took on values
corresponding to each quintile (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

All associations are reported as mean differences in cognitive score
change over a 2-year interval, across exposure levels, as 2 years is the
approximate interval between the testing cycles. In addition, to help interpret
these mean differences, we compared findings on the relation of PM exposure to
cognitive decline with age-related differences in cognitive decline, generated
from the women in our data set. While our primary focus was on
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 , we also evaluated
PM 10 .

In secondary analyses, we further adjusted our analyses for 3 measures
of socioeconomic position in the census tract of residence: percentage of adults
who have less than high school education, median home value, and median income.
We also evaluated potential mediation of air pollution’s association
with cognitive decline by respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. In
additional analyses, we further adjusted for self-reported emphysema and
indicators of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (high blood pressure,
coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft,
transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy). Finally, we conducted
sensitivity analyses restricted to women who did not move between 1988 and their
first cognitive assessment (62% of the study population).

## RESULTS
Estimated exposures to PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 varied
widely among the women ( Table 1 ). Estimated
exposures over the month preceding the initial cognitive assessment were
significantly correlated with longer-term exposures, but these correlations weakened
with increasing measurement interval length ( Table
1 ). For any given interval, estimated exposure to PM 2.5-10 was
significantly correlated with estimated exposure to PM 2.5 but at
magnitudes lower than the correlations between measures of the same PM type.

There were few meaningful differences in characteristics of women across
quintiles of long-term PM 2.5-10 exposure ( Table 2 ). From our multivariable-adjusted analyses,
we observed rates of change in global cognitive function score that were
significantly worse with higher levels of long-term exposure to
PM 2.5-10 ( P value for trend, .01; Table 3 ) and were significantly worse in the highest
vs the lowest quintile of exposure ( P =.003). Higher
estimated PM 2.5-10 exposures in the 1, 2, and 5 years before the
initial cognitive assessment were also associated with significantly worse
subsequent decline on the global cognitive score. By contrast, exposure to
PM 2.5-10 in the previous month was weakly and not significantly
associated with cognitive decline. This pattern also was apparent in the
findings for decline in the TICS and verbal memory scores, while short- and
long-term PM 2.5-10 exposures were associated with comparable
increases of rates of decline in digit span backward and verbal fluency
scores.

The distributions of key characteristics across quintiles of estimated
long-term PM 2.5 exposure were similar to those for
PM 2.5-10 ( Table 4 ), with
few notable or consistent differences across quintiles. Similar to
PM 2.5-10 , women in the highest quintile of long-term exposure to
PM 2.5 experienced significantly worse rates of change in the
global score than did women in the lowest quintile
( P =.03; Table
5 ). The trend of across quintiles were borderline significant
( P value for trend, .11), but, when modeled as continuous
variables, higher levels of both long-term PM 2.5 exposure (since
1988) and PM 2.5 exposure in the 5 years before the initial cognitive
assessment were associated with significantly worse decline in global cognition.
Decline in the individual cognitive domains generally was more strongly
predicted by long-term than recent exposure to PM 2.5 .

We observed similar differences in rates of global cognitive change per
10 μg/m 3 increment in long-term exposure to
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 (−0.020
[95% CI, −0.032 to −0.008] and
−0.018 [−0.035 to −0.002] standard
units/2 years, respectively). These differences were similar to the difference
in rates of change we observed between women in our data who were 1 to 2 years
apart in age. Expressed per SD increment of each PM measure, these differences
were −0.008 (95% CI, −0.013 to −0.003) and
−0.006 (95% CI, −0.011 to −0.001) standard
units/2 years.

Results from analyses of thoracic PM (PM 10 ) indicated
generally faster rates of cognitive decline with higher level of long-term
exposure ( P value for trend, .<.001; eTable ).

The associations of PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 with
cognitive decline remained nearly identical when we adjusted our analyses for
area socioeconomic position measures and for potential respiratory and
cardiovascular intermediates. Analyses restricted to women who did not move
yielded modestly stronger associations than those in our primary analyses. For
example, 10-μg/m 3 increments in long-term exposure to
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 corresponded to 2-year rates of
decline in the global cognitive score that were worse by 0.025 (95% CI,
−0.040 to −0.009) and 0.021 (95% CI, −0.043 to
−0.000) standard units, respectively.

## COMMENT
In this large, prospective study of older women, higher levels of long-term
exposure to both PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 were associated with
significantly faster cognitive decline. Placing these results in context, the
differences in cognitive trajectory per 10-μg/m 3 increment in
long-term exposure to PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 were similar to the
differences in trajectories between women in our study who were 1 to 2 years apart
in age; that is, 10-μg/m 3 higher exposure to PM was cognitively
equivalent to aging by up to 2 years.

Several lines of indirect evidence indicate that PM may cause cognitive
decline. Results from animal studies indicate that PM may access the brain either
via circulation, or intranasally by direct translocation through the olfactory
bulb. 38 – 40 Once in the central nervous system, fine
particles appear to exert adverse effects. Several animal studies have shown
increased brain inflammation in response to air particulate exposures. 41 – 44 In one experiment, mice were exposed either to filtered
air, ambient ultrafine particles, or a mixture of fine and ultrafine particles
sampled from Los Angeles, California, air. Two weeks after exposure, the brains of
mice in both exposed groups contained higher levels of inflammatory markers, as
compared with the mice in the control group. 41 In dogs, signs of blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neural
degeneration, cerebrovascular pathologic signs, and apoptosis in glial cells were
present more often in those who had lived in Mexico City, Mexico, an area of high
air pollution, than in dogs from less polluted cities. 44 In a postmortem study of 19 humans aged 34
to 83 years, who had died of nonneurologic causes, brain levels of cyclooxygenase-2,
an inflammatory mediator, in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were higher among
those who had lived in highly polluted cities than among those who had lived in less
polluted cities. Importantly, brain levels of amyloid-β42, a pathologic
hallmark of AD, were also higher among residents of the polluted cities. 45

The relation of PM exposure to cognitive decline may also be mediated
through cardiovascular mechanisms. Extensive experimental and epidemiologic data
indicate an association between exposure to air pollution and cardiovascular
diseases and risk factors. 10 , 11 , 46 , 47 This link is
important because vascular factors have also been found to predict cognitive decline
and dementia. 48 , 49 In our data, however, adjustment for
vascular factors did not change our findings, indicating that this is not likely a
key pathway by which PM influences cognition.

Several limitations of our study warrant consideration. First, our estimates
of PM exposure were indirect, based on spatiotemporal modeling of measurements from
air pollution monitors located near each woman’s residence. Measurement via
personal air monitoring devices is not practical for long-term exposures in
large-scale epidemiologic studies. Yet, exposure measurement errors in our study
were likely to be nondifferential with respect to degree of cognitive decline,
resulting in attenuated estimates of association. In addition, our PM exposure
estimation 50 , 51 features GIS-based spatiotemporal
statistical models with little bias and high precision—particularly relative
to other modeling approaches 24 , 26 —accounting for small-scale
variations in exposure at each participant’s residential address using
GIS-based covariates. This enabled us to assign estimated PM exposure levels to each
address for each participant throughout the study period. Therefore, exposure
estimates should be more accurate over time than estimates from initial addresses
only. If chronic PM exposure particularly affects cognitive aging or if the biologic
response occurs over longer than 1 month, this improved accuracy over time may
explain, in part, why many associations corresponding to recent PM exposure were
weaker than associations corresponding to long-term PM exposures, although it is
also plausible that recent PM exposure is less biologically relevant.

It is possible that our results from this observational study are due to
confounding. However, we did not find meaningful differences in numerous potential
confounding variables across levels of PM exposure, and adjustment for a variety of
known confounding variables—some of them measured repeatedly over several
study cycles—did not eliminate the observed associations.

Although ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 in relation to cognitive aging,
previous epidemiologic studies of adults generally suggest an adverse association
between exposure to other forms of ambient particulates and cognition. 19 – 22 In a study of 399 older women residing in urban and rural
areas of Germany, residential proximity to busy road, a source of exposure to
ultrafine particles, was associated with performance on several tests of cognition
and olfaction, but higher PM 10 exposure in the previous 5 years was
not. 20 Another study of
671 older men measured exposure to black carbon, a marker of traffic-related
particles, and observed that higher level of exposure over the previous 1 to 11
years was associated with worse cognitive function. 22 In the largest study to date, among 15 973
older adults in China, residents of areas with poorer air quality over the previous
7 to 10 years, measured by an index of ambient particulate and gas concentrations,
were more likely to have poor cognitive function. 21 Finally, in a study of 1764 adults aged 20
to 59 years living throughout the contiguous United States, higher exposure to ozone
over the previous year was associated with worse performance on several cognitive
and motor tests, but exposure to PM 10 was not. Neither of the 2 studies
that examined PM 10 observed an association with cognitive function, yet
the range of PM 10 exposure in the German study may have been too narrow
(eg, 39.3–53.6 μg/m 3 from 1980–1993) to observe a
measureable effect, 20 and the
1-year measurement interval for PM 10 exposure used in the study of
younger adults may have been too brief. 19 These previous findings also suggest that traffic-related
exposures may be important contributors to cognitive aging. Our findings complement
and extend these previous findings not only by directly examining cognitive decline
in a large population, but also by using detailed modeling of short- and long-term
PM 2.5-10 and PM 2.5 exposures.

In conclusion, we found that higher levels of exposure to ambient PM are
associated with worse cognitive decline. Importantly, these associations were
present at levels of PM exposure typical in many areas of the United States.
Therefore, if our findings are confirmed in other research, air pollution reduction
is a potential means for reducing the future population burden of age-related
cognitive decline, and eventually, dementia.
