# Title
Distinct patterns of APP processing in
the CNS in autosomal-dominant and sporadic Alzheimer disease

# Abstract
Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is a genetic disorder caused by
mutations in Amyloid Precursor Protein ( APP ) or
Presenilin ( PSEN ) genes. Studies from families
with ADAD have been critical to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer
disease (AD), the basis for the current development of amyloid-based
disease-modifying therapies in sporadic AD (SAD). However, whether the pathological
changes in APP processing in the CNS in ADAD are similar to those observed in SAD
remains unclear. In this study, we measured β -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) protein levels and activity, APP and
APP C-terminal fragments in brain samples from subjects with ADAD carrying APP or PSEN1 mutations
( n = 18), patients with SAD ( n = 27) and age-matched controls ( n = 22). We also measured sAPP β and
BACE protein levels, as well as BACE activity, in CSF from individuals carrying PSEN1 mutations (10 mutation carriers and 7
non-carrier controls), patients with SAD ( n = 32)
and age-matched controls ( n = 11). We found that
in the brain, the pattern in ADAD was characterized by an increase in APP β -C-terminal fragment ( β -CTF) levels despite no changes in BACE protein levels or activity.
In contrast, the pattern in SAD in the brain was mainly characterized by an increase
in BACE levels and activity, with less APP β -CTF
accumulation than ADAD. In the CSF, no differences were found between groups in BACE
activity or expression or sAPP β levels. Taken
together, these data suggest that the physiopathological events underlying the
chronic A β production/clearance imbalance in SAD
and ADAD are different. These differences should be considered in the design of
intervention trials in AD. The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00401-012-1062-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

## Introduction
Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is a genetic disorder that accounts
for less than 1 % of all AD cases [ 6 ].
It is genetically heterogeneous and has been associated with mutations in the
amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) gene or in the
two presenilin genes (presenilin-1 and -2 or PSEN1 and PSEN2 ) [ 6 ].

Studies in ADAD have been critical to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis,
which states that the sequence of pathogenic events leading to AD is primarily
initiated by accumulation of β -amyloid
(A β ) [ 24 ]. The knowledge derived from these studies has been instrumental
in guiding the development of the amyloid-based disease-modifying drugs currently
being tested in sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD).

A β peptide is the major protein component of
amyloid plaques observed in the brain of patients with ADAD and SAD and it is
produced via sequential cleavage of APP by two proteases, β - and γ -secretases [ 37 ]. The prevailing view about the cause of brain
A β deposition in ADAD is that APP and PSEN mutations
lead to a chronic increase in the absolute or relative production of the
fibrillogenic 42-aminoacid-long form of A β (A β 42) that, over time, leads to formation of
brain oligomeric A β , deposition of fibrillar
A β and eventually neurodegeneration
[ 6 ]. The causes of A β accumulation in SAD are far more complex. A predominant
view claims that brain A β deposition in SAD
results from the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors that end
up in a chronic imbalance between A β production
and clearance. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this chronic
imbalance in SAD, such as increased [ 19 , 26 , 27 , 34 , 58 ], altered
production [ 25 ] or reduced clearance of
A β [ 38 ]. The investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AD
has been complicated by the fact that many studies about the pathogenesis of AD rely
on transgenic mouse models that overexpress ADAD-associated mutations. The results
of these investigations are often extrapolated to all forms of AD, irrespective of
the underlying causes. Elucidating the differences and commonalities between ADAD
and SAD in the human CNS is an important topic as the first intervention trials in
preclinical and presymptomatic AD are imminent. Although some previous studies have
focused on the differences in A β isoforms between
ADAD and SAD in the CNS [ 44 – 46 , 49 ], other aspects of APP processing remain poorly
investigated. In this study, we focused on BACE protein and activity, and their
related cleavage products in a large a collection of well-characterized brain and
CSF samples from subjects with ADAD carrying APP or PSEN1 mutations, patients with SAD and
age-matched controls.

## Materials and methods
All individuals or relatives had given their written informed consent for
research and the study was approved by the local ethical standards committee on
human experimentation. Human brain samples were obtained from the Institut de
Neuropatologia, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, and the Neurological Tissue
Bank of the Biobanc-Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS. We included samples from 10 patients
with ADAD (2 with an APP mutation and 8 with PSEN1 mutations, mean age 55 ± 8.7 years,
Table 1 ) [ 2 , 23 , 35 , 36 ], 19 patients with SAD (mean age 78 ± 8.0 years, Braak
neurofibrillary stage = V–VI, Thal phase of A β = 5), and 22 healthy controls (Braak neurofibrillary stage = 0; 12
young controls and 10 elderly controls, mean age 48.7 ± 13.2 and 75.1 ± 6.5 years,
respectively). The mean postmortem interval (PMI) was 7.4 ± 4.8 h. As a
confirmation group we included 8 additional cases with the E280A PSEN1 mutation (mean age 54.5 ± 4.9 years) and 8
age-matched cases with SAD from the University of Antioquia Brain Bank
(Table 1 ) [ 52 , 53 ]. For biochemical analyses we used frozen blocks from the
frontal association cortex, known to have high density of amyloid plaques
[ 3 , 34 ]. For immunohistochemical analyses paraffin-embedded samples
from several brain regions were used (see below). Table 1 Clinical and neuropathological data of ADAD patients from whom

A total of 60 CSF samples were included in this study. CSF samples from PSEN1 mutation carriers were part of the
Genetic Counseling Program (PICOGEN) [ 18 ] at the Hospital Clínic, Barcelona. This group included 10
subjects carrying PSEN1 mutations (5 subjects
with ADAD, global deterioration scale 3–5 and 5 presymptomatic mutation carriers),
and 7 non-mutation carriers from the same family (Table 2 ). The clinical and CSF data of some of these patients have been
previously reported [ 17 ]. Adjusted
age was defined as the subject’s age relative to the median age of onset in the
family. We also included 32 CSF samples from patients with dementia due to SAD and
11 age-matched healthy controls (mean age 74.6 ± 5.3 and 67.6 ± 4.0, respectively)
obtained at the Hospital Sant Pau, Barcelona. Table 2 Clinical and demographic data from PSEN1 mutations carriers from whom CSF was

Tissues of human brain samples weighing 100–200 mg were homogenized with the
proteoExtract™ Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Calbiochem). BACE1 activity
in human brain homogenates was measured as previously described [ 19 , 20 ]. This BACE activity assay was based on an antibody capture
assay in which activity was measured via fluorescent emission after the cleavage
of a β -secretase substrate [ 19 , 20 ]. To avoid the detection of other β -secretase activities, BACE was first captured via its C-terminal
domain with anti-BACE1 antibody MAB5308 (mouse monoclonal anti-BACE, Chemicon)
raised against BACE1 epitopes different from BACE2. Briefly, 96-well plates were
coated overnight with the capture antibody MAB5308 at a dilution of 1:1,000 in
100 mM carbonate buffer at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0), and then blocked with a blocking reagent
(25 % BlockAce; Dai-Nippon) for 6 h. The samples (50 μl of 0.004 wt/vol) were
added to the wells containing 50 μl of Superblock ® blocking buffer (Pierce) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were
washed 6 times with PBS, and the enzymatic reaction was carried out by incubation
with 10 μM of the fluorogenic β -secretase
substrate Arg-Glu(5-[aminoethyl] aminonaphthalene sulfonate
[EDANS])-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys
(4′-dimethylaminoazo-benzene-4-carboxylate[DABCYL])-Arg (Calbiochem) in acetate
buffer at pH 4.1, which is optimal for BACE activity [ 19 , 20 ]. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the enzymatic
reaction was measured using a Victor3 Wallac microplate reader
(Perkin-Elmer).

BACE activity in human CSF was measured by incubating 10 μl of sample with
50 μl of BACE substrate (40 μM) overnight at 37 °C in acetate buffer with 100 mM
sodium chloride (pH 4.1) containing 0.025 % BSA [ 60 ]. Fluorescence was measured at different time points with a
Victor3 Wallac microplate reader with an excitation wavelength at 355 nm and
emission wavelength at 486 nm. The concentration of BACE substrate used was that
which best differentiated serial CSF dilutions over different time points. The
enzymatic activity was calculated as ΔUF/min from the linear part of the reaction
(between 2 and 24 h). The activity was completely inhibited by a BACE1 inhibitor
verifying the specificity of the assay. The intra-assay and inter-assay
coefficients of variation were 1.2 and 5.8 %, respectively.

BACE1 protein, sAPP α , sAPP β , and APP β -CTF
levels were measured in human brain samples or CSF using commercial kit assays
(IBL). These assays are based on a solid-phase sandwich ELISA using specific
anti-BACE or anti-APP antibodies. For sAPP β levels the cross-reactivity with human sAPP β -Sw
and human sAPP α is 0.25 and 1.41 %,
respectively, and for APP β -CTF levels the
cross-reactivity with human sAPP β and human
sAPP α is ≤0.1 %. BACE1 protein and APP β -CTF levels were measured in the membrane
brain fraction while sAPP α and sAPP β levels were measured in CSF.

Detailed neuropathological studies were performed on multiple formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded samples, as previously described [ 23 ]. For immunohistochemistry, dewaxed 5-μm-thick sections that
included hippocampus, parahippocampal and temporo-occipital gyrus were
immunostained in an automated stainer (DAKO Autostainer Plus) using the following
antibodies: a rabbit anti-APP C-terminal (Sigma-Aldrich) recognizing the
C-terminus (amino acids 676–695) of human APP 695, APP751 and APP770 at a dilution
of 1:1,500; a mouse anti-APP N-terminal (Millipore, clone 22C11) antibody at a
dilution of 1:50; and a mouse monoclonal anti- β A4-amyloid (DAKO, clone 6F/3D) antibody at a dilution of 1:400. To
further evaluate the neuritic component of amyloid plaques, anti-ubiquitin (DAKO,
polyclonal) and anti-hyperphosphorylated tau (Thermo Scientific, mc, clone AT8)
antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:400 and 1:200, respectively.
APP-immunoreactive structures were assessed semiquantitatively as follows: + mild
(1–10 conglomerates of dystrophic neurites in one visual field using a 10×
objective), ++ moderate (from 10 to 20 neuritic conglomerates), +++ abundant
(>20 neuritic conglomerates), similar to the assessment of β -amyloid deposits [ 1 ]. For antigen retrieval, sections were immersed for 5 min in
98–100 % formic acid and heated for 20 min in a pressure cooking oven in 0.1 M
sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.0. The reaction was visualized with 0.05 %
diaminobenzidine and 0.01 %
H 2 O 2 .

Human brain homogenates were electrophoresed in 5–16 % Tris-Tricine gels,
transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting
with a rabbit anti-APP C-terminal (1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich), a rabbit monoclonal
N-terminus anti-BACE (D10E5, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling), a mouse monoclonal
C-terminus anti-BACE (MAB5308, 1:1,000; Chemicon) or mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin
(1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Specificity of the anti-BACE antibodies was
verified by Western blot using brain homogenates from P7 BACE1−/− mice (a kind
gift from Bart De Strooper [ 16 ]; Fig.
S1). Incubation with primary antibodies was followed by detection with
IR-fluorescent-conjugated antibody (LI-COR Biosciences). All blots were quantified
by densitometric analysis and normalized to tubulin (Odyssey software, LI-COR
Biosciences).

APOE genotype was determined as previously
described [ 23 ].

Non-parametric statistical analysis (Kruskal–Wallis) was performed to analyze
differences in BACE1, APP β -CTF, sAPP β protein levels and BACE activity. Correlation
analysis between age and CSF BACE1 activity, APP β -CTF, and sAPP β protein levels
was performed using the Spearman’s Rho test. Statistical significance for all the
analyses was set at 5 % ( α = 0.05). All data
were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version
20.0.

## Results
We first examined the initial proteolytic cleavage involved in A β generation, performed by BACE1 [ 37 ]. BACE1 protein levels and activity were
measured in homogenates from the frontal cortex from ADAD cases, and compared with
those from SAD cases and age-matched controls. Across the entire group ( n = 51) BACE1 protein levels and activity positively
correlated with age ( ρ = 0.3, p = 0.03 and ρ = 0.28, p = 0.04, respectively).
Consistent with other studies [ 19 ],
there was no association of BACE1 protein levels or activity with PMI, gender or APOE genotype. BACE1 protein levels
correlated with BACE1 activity in the entire sample ( ρ = 0.29, p = 0.04). No
differences were detected in either brain BACE1 protein levels or activity between
ADAD cases and age-matched controls (Fig. 1 a, b; p = 0.91 and p = 0.42, respectively). Consistent with previous
reports [ 19 , 27 , 58 ], we found an increase in BACE1 protein levels (1.91-fold,
Fig. 1 a; p = 0.01) and activity (1.76-fold, Fig. 1 b; p = 0.04) in the frontal
cortex of SAD cases when compared to age-matched controls. There was a significant
increase in BACE1 protein levels ( p = 0.03) but
not in BACE1 activity ( p = 0.12) in SAD
relative to ADAD cases. The levels of BACE1 protein in brain homogenates were also
analyzed by Western blot using the specific anti-BACE1 antibody D10E5 (Fig. S1).
These analyses confirmed the increase in BACE1 protein expression in SAD relative
to controls and ADAD, as well as the lack of differences between ADAD and controls
(Fig. 1 c, d). Fig. 1 Brain BACE1 protein levels and activity in ADAD, SAD patients
and controls. BACE1 protein levels and activity were measured in brain
homogenates from ADAD and SAD patients, and from young (YC) and elderly
(EC) controls. There was an increase in BACE1 protein levels ( a ** p = 0.01)
and activity ( b * p = 0.04) in the frontal cortex of SAD cases compared to
age-matched elderly controls. No differences were detected between ADAD
cases and age-matched controls in either brain BACE1 protein levels or
activity ( p = 0.91 and p = 0.42, respectively). There was a
significant increase in BACE1 protein levels ( a * p = 0.03) but not in
BACE1 activity ( b , n.s., p = 0.12) in SAD relative to ADAD cases.
Western blot analyses using the BACE-specific antibody BC05 confirmed the
increased in BACE expression in SAD compared to ADAD ( c ) and the lack of differences between ADAD and
controls ( d ). Representative blots are
shown

age-matched elderly controls. No differences were detected between ADAD
cases and age-matched controls in either brain BACE1 protein levels or
activity ( p = 0.91 and p = 0.42, respectively). There was a

Western blot analyses using the BACE-specific antibody BC05 confirmed the
increased in BACE expression in SAD compared to ADAD ( c ) and the lack of differences between ADAD and
controls ( d ). Representative blots are
shown

We next tested whether an increase in BACE1 expression or activity was present
in ADAD in the CSF. We obtained CSF samples from a cohort of subjects recruited
from a genetic counseling program for familial dementias [ 17 , 18 ]. We used a fluorogenic CSF BACE1 enzymatic activity assay to
measure BACE1 activity in CSF samples from 17 PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-carriers (Table 2 ), subjects with SAD dementia ( n = 32) and healthy controls ( n = 11). CSF BACE1 activity did not correlate with age, MMSE score
or CSF A β 42 levels in the entire sample
( n = 60) or with the adjusted age in PSEN1 mutation carriers ( n = 10). When analyzed according to clinical or
mutation status, no differences in CSF BACE1 activity were detected among PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-mutation
carriers ( p = 0.85) or between SAD cases and
controls ( p = 0.1; Fig. 2 a). As an additional measure of APP processing, we
analyzed CSF levels of sAPP β , a soluble
fragment generated by BACE cleavage. Levels of sAPP β correlated positively with age ( ρ = 0.279; p = 0.03) but not with
MMSE score or CSF A β 42 levels in the entire
sample. We found no differences in CSF sAPP β levels between PSEN1 mutation carriers and
non-mutation carriers ( p = 0.85;
Fig. 2 b) or between SAD dementia cases
and age-matched controls ( p = 0.12;
Fig. 2 b). CSF BACE1 activity and
sAPP β levels showed a positive correlation in
the entire subject sample ( ρ = 0.501, p < 0.001; Fig. 2 c). Almost identical results were found when CSF sAPP α levels were measured (Fig. 2 d). This is not surprising since CSF sAPP β and sAPP α levels showed a
strong positive correlation in the entire subject sample ( ρ = 0.799, p < 0.0001;
Fig. 2 e), as in previously reported
studies [ 33 , 59 ]. To examine whether there was any difference
in CSF BACE1 protein levels, Western blotting was carried out using the specific
anti-BACE1 antibody D10E5 and no differences were detected between PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers
(Fig. 2 f). Overall, no changes in CSF
BACE1 activity or expression could be detected in subjects with PSEN1 mutations or SAD compared to age-matched
controls. Fig. 2 CSF BACE1 activity in PSEN1 mutation carriers, SAD patients and controls. a CSF BACE1 activity was measured in non-mutation carriers
controls ( YC ), PSEN1 mutation carriers ( MC ), elderly controls ( EC ) and SAD patients. No differences were found between groups
in CSF BACE1 activity. b CSF
sAPP β levels were determined in YC,
MC, EC and SAD patients. No differences were found between SAD cases and
age-matched controls or between MC and YC. c CSF BACE1 activity and sAPP β levels showed a positive correlation in the entire subject
sample ( ρ = 0,501, p < 0.001). d CSF sAPP α levels were
determined in YC, MC, EC and SAD patients. No differences were found
between SAD cases and age-matched controls or between MC and YC. e CSF sAPP β and sAPP α levels showed a strong
positive correlation in the entire subject sample ( ρ = 0,799, p < 0.0001). f Western
blot analyses of BACE1 protein levels using the specific anti-BACE1
antibody D10E5 showed no differences between PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-carriers ( YC ). The specificity of the D10E5 was
determined by using brain samples from 7-day-old ( P7 ) wt and BACE 1−/− mice (Fig. S1). A representative blot
is shown

Using ELISA, we then determined the levels of APP β -CTF, a protein fragment generated from full-length APP in frontal
cortex brain homogenates obtained from patients with ADAD, SAD and controls. The
APP β -CTF fragment is generated by BACE and
processed by γ -secretase to release A β peptides [ 37 ]. We found that ADAD cases showed a prominent APP β -CTF accumulation when compared to age-matched
controls and to SAD cases (both p < 0.001,
Fig. 3 a). SAD cases did not show
statistically significant higher APP β -CTF
levels than age-matched controls by ELISA ( p = 0.47, Fig. 3 a), despite
being elevated by Western blot (Fig. S2). No differences were found between young
and elderly controls. The levels of APP β -CTF
were not influenced by age, gender or APOE genotype. The results of the ELISA were confirmed by Western blot analysis in our
subject sample and in patients with the E280A PSEN1 mutation (Fig. 3 b–d;
Fig. S2). Among ADAD cases, the APP A713T and
some PSEN1 mutations (P264L, P286P) displayed
higher levels of APP C-terminal fragments than others (M139T, V89L). Fig. 3 Brain APP β -CTF levels are
elevated in ADAD. APP β -CTF levels were
measured in membrane fractions in brain homogenates from ADAD, SAD and
controls ( a ). ADAD cases showed higher
APP β -CTF levels than age-matched
controls and SAD (** p < 0.01). These
differences were confirmed by Western blot in samples from patients with
ADAD, SAD and controls. APP CTF accumulation was observed in ADAD cases
compared to age-matched controls ( b ) and
to SAD cases ( c , d ). APP CTF accumulation was also observed by Western blot
in SAD cases compared to controls despite the fact that it did not reach
statistical significance in the ELISA assay ( e )

Brain APP β -CTF levels are
elevated in ADAD. APP β -CTF levels were
measured in membrane fractions in brain homogenates from ADAD, SAD and
controls ( a ). ADAD cases showed higher
APP β -CTF levels than age-matched
controls and SAD (** p < 0.01). These
differences were confirmed by Western blot in samples from patients with
ADAD, SAD and controls. APP CTF accumulation was observed in ADAD cases
compared to age-matched controls ( b ) and
to SAD cases ( c , d ). APP CTF accumulation was also observed by Western blot
in SAD cases compared to controls despite the fact that it did not reach
statistical significance in the ELISA assay ( e )

Since our biochemical data indicated elevated APP β -CTF levels in ADAD compared to SAD and controls, we next evaluated
the distribution of APP accumulation. We performed immunohistochemical studies on
brain sections from ADAD cases using either an anti-APP C-terminal or an anti-APP
N-terminal antibody. As previously described [ 13 , 30 , 43 ], we confirmed that antibodies rose against
APP labeled dystrophic neurites of senile plaques in SAD using both,
anti-C-terminal and anti-N-terminal antibodies. Both APP antibodies also detected
APP epitopes in dystrophic neurites of senile plaques in ADAD (Fig. S3).
Semiquantitative assessment of the neuritic component associated to amyloid
plaques in parahippocampal and temporo-occipital cortices revealed that patients
with ADAD had a more prominent neuritic component than those with SAD
(Fig. 4 ; Table 3 ) independently of the number of A β plaques. This was also observed using anti-ubiquitin
(Fig. 4 ) and anti-phosphorylated tau
antibodies (Fig. S3 and data not shown). Cases with predominant cotton-wool
plaques ( PSEN1 P264L, PSEN1 L286P) showed fewer APP-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites

Relationship between dystrophic neurites and A β deposits in ADAD cases

## Discussion
The main finding in the current study is that ADAD and SAD display distinct
profiles in BACE protein and activity, and in APP β -CTF levels in the brain. While no apparent increase in brain BACE1
protein levels or activity was observed in ADAD, both were clearly elevated in SAD.
Accumulation of APP β -CTF was higher in the brain
in ADAD than in SAD and controls. No changes in BACE measures were observed in the
CSF between ADAD and SAD.

Research in ADAD has been instrumental as a model to understand the pathogenesis
of SAD and to guide the current development of anti-amyloid strategies. The
mainstream paradigm claims that ADAD and SAD share similar clinical and pathological
phenotypes as well as common mechanisms of disease, irrespective of the initiation
factors [ 6 , 54 ]. However, very few studies have investigated
the differences in APP processing between ADAD and SAD in the human CNS to support
this view. Previous studies have mainly focused on A β isoforms, tau or p-tau in the CSF [ 5 , 44 , 46 , 49 ] or A β isoforms in human
brain [ 45 , 49 ]. The findings suggest a specific CSF profile
of A β isoforms in ADAD, with low levels of
A β 1-37, A β 1-38, A β 1-39 and A β 1-42 compared with SAD [ 5 , 44 ]. Whether other
relevant aspects of APP processing differ between ADAD and SAD remains
unknown.

BACE1 is a type-I transmembrane protease highly expressed in neurons
[ 11 ]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that BACE1 protein levels and activity are elevated approximately
twofold in the brain of SAD patients [ 9 , 19 , 27 , 58 ], suggesting
that this feature might initiate or contribute to brain A β accumulation [ 34 ]. Our
data confirmed the increased BACE1 levels and activity in SAD brains, but no
increase could be detected in ADAD cases compared to age-matched controls. Although
the increase in brain BACE1 protein levels in SAD relative to ADAD cases might
reflect a difference in chronological age between groups, the increment in brain
BACE1 activity and protein levels in SAD compared to age-matched controls suggests a
disease-specific effect. Our data differ from the only previous study that had
examined BACE1 expression or activity in ADAD brains [ 22 ], where the authors reported an increase in BACE1 mRNA levels
and activity in 11 ADAD cases carrying 10 different PSEN1 mutations. The strengths of the current study are the use of
age-matched controls without any brain lesion, the selection of a region in which
elevated BACE1 activity had been previously detected in SAD [ 34 ], and the investigation of CSF samples obtained
from PSEN1 mutation carriers. Our findings lend
support to other studies that reported no change in BACE1 expression or activity in
either APP or PS1 mutant-transfected cells or APP×PS1-transgenic mice [ 4 , 20 , 34 ].

In contrast with our findings in human brain, we did not find any differences in
CSF BACE activity or expression, or in sAPP β levels between groups. The lack of increase in CSF BACE1 activity or sAPP β levels in cases with SAD dementia compared to healthy
controls is in agreement with most recent studies [ 48 , 59 ]. The present
data together with previous work [ 48 , 59 , 60 ] suggest that BACE1 activity may become elevated at the stage of
mild cognitive impairment, and then decrease over time as disease progresses
[ 48 ]. Our data obtained in patients
with SAD dementia also indicate that CSF BACE1 activity does not parallel brain
BACE1 activity, at least in the advanced stage of the disease. While BACE1 activity
and protein levels in the brain tend to increase in late-stage AD, BACE1 activity in
the CSF would stabilize or even decrease, perhaps as a result of a reduction in
global neuronal function [ 48 ]. More
generally, this observation indicates that CSF may not accurately reflect the
changes in the local intracellular or extracellular environment [ 10 , 57 ]. Taken together, our results indicate that brain BACE1
up-regulation is characteristic of SAD, but is not a salient feature in many
ADAD-associated mutations. Previous studies [ 26 , 27 , 47 ] have shown that increased BACE1 expression in
SAD is due to post-translational regulation mechanisms and that BACE1 mRNA levels
are unchanged. One possible explanation is that the increase in BACE1 in SAD results
from the interaction of Alzheimer pathology with diverse factors associated to
aging, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory changes or microRNA dysregulation,
conditions known to increase BACE1 expression and activity in cell culture
[ 12 , 26 , 50 , 55 ].

The lack of increase in BACE1 in ADAD has clinical implications as BACE1 has
become an attractive drug target for AD intervention [ 11 ]. Although inhibitor development has proved to be highly
challenging, some promising BACE1 inhibitors as well as other strategies, such as
immunization with anti-BACE1 antibodies, have been developed [ 11 ]. The lack of increase in brain or CSF BACE1
expression or activity in ADAD in our study suggests that BACE1 is a less attractive
target for families with ADAD than for patients with SAD. Nonetheless, it is still
possible that BACE1 inhibition may prove to be effective as a preventive therapy in
subjects with APP or PSEN1 mutations. This is a relevant and timely topic since clinical
trials in ADAD are imminent.

Another important finding derived from our study is the higher accumulation of
APP β -CTFs in the brain of ADAD cases than in SAD
patients and controls. The APP β -CTF fragment is
generated by BACE and processed by γ -secretase to
release A β peptides [ 37 ]. The main explanation for the APP β -CTF accumulation in SAD has been the overproduction due
to increased BACE1 protein levels and activity [ 58 ]. However, the lack of elevated BACE1 in ADAD points to other
underlying mechanisms. It has been suggested that PSEN mutations alter the conformation of the γ -secretase complex [ 7 , 14 ]. This change could be a plausible
mechanism by which PSEN mutations lead to γ -secretase dysfunction and the formation of
longer A β peptides in ADAD [ 7 , 15 ]. Since APP β -CTF are processed
by γ -secretase, it is possible that elevated APP β -CTF may be the result of a dysfunctional γ -secretase. A recent study has shown that
ADAD-associated mutations do not consistently affect kinetic activity [ 15 ] excluding the possibility that mutations
inhibit γ -secretase. However, conformational
changes in γ -secretase may subtly slow substrate
processivity which could increase β -CTF in ADAD.
Other possible mechanisms underlying APP β -CTF
accumulation in ADAD include impaired macroautophagy as it has been shown that APP β -CTF is rapidly cleared by autophagy under
physiological conditions [ 56 ]. In any
case, the accumulation of APP CTFs has been shown to be neurotoxic by itself
[ 29 , 31 , 39 , 42 ]. This phenomenon has also been observed in
wild-type mice or transgenic APP mouse models after treatment with classical γ -secretase inhibitors [ 8 , 40 ]
or after inactivation of PSEN1 [ 51 ]. In both these situations, APP CTFs accumulate
at the presynaptic terminals, likely impairing synaptic plasticity and long-term
memory [ 40 , 51 ]. Interestingly, APP CTF accumulation has been
postulated, together with inhibition of Notch processing [ 15 ], as a possible mechanism underlying cognitive
side effects in patients with AD treated with the γ -secretase inhibitor semagacestat [ 8 , 37 ]. Although the
precise cause of APP CTF accumulation in ADAD deserves further investigation, it is
likely that this feature acts as an active component of the disease that may
contribute to the metabolic and cytoskeletal derangement and
neurodegeneration.

Our findings also demonstrate that the neuritic component is more prominent in
ADAD cases than in SAD. It has previously been shown that full-length APP
accumulates in dystrophic neurites in SAD [ 13 , 21 , 28 , 30 , 43 ] and that this
accumulation is an early event that occurs prior to tau accumulation [ 13 ]. Our results extend these findings to ADAD and
show a more severe neuritic component in ADAD than in SAD. The wide variety of
neuronal proteins found in AD in dystrophic neurites has been increasingly
recognized as a failure of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway [ 41 ]. In addition, it has been shown that PS1 is
essential for lysosomal proteolysis and autophagy and that PS1-null or PS-ADAD
fibroblasts display marked autophagy impairment [ 32 , 41 ]. This defect
could account for our observation of numerous and enlarged dystrophic neurites in
ADAD as compared to SAD. Finally, the contribution of APP-immunoreactive dystrophic
neurites to parenchymal amyloid deposition seems unlikely because at least one half
of diffuse plaques, which may represent the earliest stage of the amyloid plaque, do
not contain APP-immunoreactive neuritic profiles [ 13 , 30 ] and we did not
observe APP epitopes in dystrophic neurites in ADAD cases with cotton-wool
plaques.

The main limitation in the present study is that as only the frontal cortex
region was analyzed, we cannot exclude the possibility that other brain areas might
have shown different results. Besides, our study only included cases carrying either
two APP mutations or nine PSEN mutations, and whether our findings are generalizable to all ADAD
cases requires further investigation. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the two APP mutations investigated herein are close to
the γ -secretase cleavage site, and they were
predicted to affect γ -secretase processing on a
similar way to PSEN mutations. It is possible
that other APP mutations located outside of the γ -secretase cleavage site may have shown
different effects.

In summary, the data presented herein reinforce the different physiopathological
mechanisms underlying the A β production/clearance
imbalance in SAD and ADAD. These differences in APP processing may contribute to
explain the lack of alignment between studies in humans and in AD animal models. A
deeper understanding of the common and divergent fundamental pathogenic mechanisms
in ADAD and SAD is needed to fine-tune and accelerate drug development in AD.
