Identification of common variants associated with human hippocampal and intracranial volumes

# Abstract
Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer’s disease 1 , 2 and is reduced in schizophrenia 3 , major depression 4 and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy 5 . Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable 6 , 7 , identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10 −16 ) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2 , was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10 −12 ). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10 −7 ).

## ONLINE METHODS
All participants provided written informed consent, and studies were approved by the respective Local Research Ethics committees or Institutional Review Boards. MRI scans came from previously collected data. Suggested protocols for imaging analysis are publicly available on the ENIGMA Consortium website (see URLs); however, any validated segmentation software was permitted. Accuracy of segmentation programs is influenced by scanner and head-coil type and scanner sequences and by participant characteristics, such as age. Each site was permitted to use any validated automated segmentation algorithm that worked most accurately in their data set. The two most commonly used hippocampal segmentation packages were the FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) 16 from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) package of tools 43 and FreeSurfer 17 . Brain volume, the sum of gray and white matter excluding ventricles and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), was calculated using the FSL FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) 44 package or FreeSurfer. Estimated total intracranial volume was calculated through registration of each MRI scan to a standard brain image template 18 , using either FSL FLIRT 45 or FreeSurfer (exceptions referenced in Supplementary Table 2 ). To calculate intracranial volume, the inverse of the determinant of the transformation matrix was multiplied by the template volume (1,948,105 mm 3 ). Extensive quality control analysis on phenotype segmentations included manual examination of phenotype volume histograms ( Supplementary Figs. 2–6 ) and box plots of all volumetric measures. Outliers were manually evaluated by overlaying the automated segmentations on the original MRI scan. Subjects were excluded from the analysis if structures were poorly segmented.

As assessed previously, the correlation in volumes between automatic and manually segmented hippocampi was high; the accuracy was reported to be higher with FreeSurfer than with FIRST in one study (FreeSurfer r = 0.82; FIRST r = 0.66) 46 and similar between the two in another (FreeSurfer r = 0.73; FIRST r = 0.71) 47 . Scan-rescan reliability was also high for both methods (FreeSurfer intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.98; FIRST ICC = 0.93) 48 . We undertook a large-scale assessment to determine the correspondence between segmentations from both FSL and FreeSurfer in the same subjects. Correspondence was found to be reasonably high for average bilateral hippocampal segmentation ( r = 0.75; N = 6,093; Supplementary Table 4 ). This is close to the agreement between different human raters, as quantified by interrater reliability (ICC = 0.73–0.85) 49 , 50 , which may be a reasonable upper bound on the accuracy of automated segmentation. Brain volume and intracranial volume were delineated with high correspondence between the two methods ( r = 0.95, r = 0.90, respectively; N = 4,321).

Heritability estimates for trait measures were calculated in two family-based samples, QTIM and GOBS. Estimates for the QTIM sample used a twin and sibling analysis within Mx. An extended family analysis in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR) 51 was used for the GOBS sample.

Given sample size and the heritability of hippocampal volume, power calculations were performed using the Genetic Power Calculator 52 . We had 99.92% power to detect variants with effect sizes of 1% of the variance and 71.16% power to detect variants with effect sizes of 0.5% of the variance for MAF ≥ 0.05.

All cohorts were genotyped using commercially available arrays. Genetics protocols were developed to standardize the filtering, imputation and association of genome-wide genotype data (see ENIGMA protocols in URLs). SNPs were filtered out of samples on the basis of standard quality control criteria, including low MAF (<0.01), poor genotype calling (call rate of <95%) and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium indicating possible errors in genotyping ( P < 1 × 10 −6 ). Genotyping methods and exceptions to these thresholds are summarized in Supplementary Table 3 .

Genetic homogeneity within each sample was assessed through MDS plots ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Ancestry outliers were excluded through visual inspection. A standardized population template from HapMap 3 representing those sampled was selected for imputation. Performance of software for imputation is generally similar between the most used methods 53 , 54 for common variants (MACH 55 , IMPUTE 56 and BEAGLE 57 ); the protocols provided included use of the MACH tool. As raw genotype data were not directly transferred to the meta-analysis site, a histogram of allele frequency differences between each contributing group and the HapMap 3 CEU population was generated for each group ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) to further examine genotyping and imputation quality. A simulation to determine the effect of varying quality control thresholds on imputation quality ( Supplementary Table 6 ) showed that the minor variation in quality control thresholds and imputation reference panels between sites was unlikely to have influenced imputation accuracy.

Genome-wide association analyses were performed that included and excluded individuals with disease. Including individuals with disease (all subjects) offers advantages of greater sample size and wider phenotype distribution, which may provide greater power to detect genetic effects 58 – 60 . We reanalyzed phenotypes after we excluded individuals with disease to confirm that the observed associations were not due to confounds relating to disease, medication or the possibly altered environments and experiences of these persons. To aid in the interpretation of results, we reanalyzed hippocampal volume after controlling for intracranial volume and total brain volume in two separate analyses. This helped to determine whether the observed associations were caused by direct effects on hippocampal volume or were attributable to more global associations with head size. In addition, genome-wide association analyses of intracranial volume and brain volume were conducted in the healthy controls to clarify whether observed associations were specific to hippocampal volume or influenced brain size in general. Participating sites were asked to conduct five genome-wide association analyses (three analyses of hippocampal volume, intracranial volume and brain volume). In addition, cohorts with groups of individuals with disease were asked to perform hippocampal analyses including data from these individuals.

Evidence for association was assessed using the allelic dosage of each SNP (accounting for familial relationships in the GOBS, QTIM and SYS samples). SNP-derived covariates were tested as fixed effects, while explicitly modeling the genetic relationships between family members in these pedigree-based studies 51 , 61 , 62 . Analyses used multiple linear regression with the phenotype of interest as a dependent variable and the additive dosage of each SNP as an independent variable of interest, controlling for covariates of population stratification (four MDS components), age, age 2 , sex and the interactions between age and sex and age 2 and sex. Dummy covariates were used to control for different scanner sequences or equipment within a site when needed. We refer to these covariates as ‘other covariates’, and these were included in all analyses. The extensive regression model was used to statistically control for factors known to affect hippocampal volume that are not specific genetic influences. Recommended protocols for association were provided to the studies based on those used in mach2qtl software (see ENIGMA protocols).

To combine information from multiple studies, we generated a secure web-accessible upload site for participants to upload their association results. An automated system parsed the uploaded results files (see URLs). This parser was designed to read raw results files from a variety of association software packages (mach2qtl, PLINK, SOLAR, SNPTEST, QUICKTEST, Merlin-offline and ProbABEL), perform a series of tests on the incoming data to ensure quality, correctly assign the effect allele (dependent on both the imputation and association programs used) and correctly scale the β values and standard errors from association into the same units. Quality control was performed on imputed SNPs to filter out SNPs with low frequency (MAF of <0.01) or poor imputation quality (estimated R 2 of <0.3). Result files and summary statistics from each group were pooled for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was undertaken for each SNP across all groups based on a fixed-effects model using an inverse standard error–weighted meta-analysis protocol implemented in METAL 19 . Genomic control was applied at the level of each study and at the meta-analysis level to adjust for population stratification or cryptic relatedness not accounted for by MDS components 63 . To account for heterogeneity across samples, a random-effects meta-analysis 20 was also conducted via the program METASOFT without using genomic control. Using KGG 64 we performed gene-based tests on the double genome–controlled meta-analysis results, using the extended Simes test 24 to obtain an overall P value for association of the entire gene with a 50-kb boundary on either side. Results from genes with P ≤ 1 × 10 −4 are presented ( Supplementary Tables 18–25 ).

Meta-analysis was performed separately on the discovery sample, the CEU and TSI replication sample and the CEU and YRI or MEX replication sample. These results were then pooled to form the combined meta-analysis statistics for discovery and replication. The in silico replication results from the CHARGE Consortium were added to this, and a final meta-analysis was conducted. The location of Manhattan and quantile-quantile plots is specified in Supplementary Table 27.

To appropriately account for the multiple comparisons conducted, we first sought to determine the effective number of independent phenotypes among the eight highly correlated genome-wide association analyses. This was calculated by creating an 8 × 8 matrix derived from cross-correlations of meta-analytic t statistics of association for each SNP across phenotypes. The resulting correlation matrix provided an estimate of the similarity between phenotypes after adjusting for covariates of interest and appropriately controlling for family structure. The effective number of tests was then calculated by summing eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, weighted by a formula that appropriately controls false positive rates in simulation 65 . The effective number of tests was determined to be 4 and an overall genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10 −8 /4 = 1.25 × 10 −8 was used throughout the manuscript.

Regulatory potential of SNPs identified in the genome-wide association analysis was examined in three samples. In the UCL epilepsy cohort, tissue was obtained from resection material from affected individuals who had undergone surgery for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, according to established clinical protocols. Total RNA from the middle temporal cortex (Brodmann areas 20 and 21) from 86 subjects was isolated and randomly hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays, and quality control analysis was performed using standard methods. The effects of several methodological (day of expression hybridization, RNA integrity number (RIN)) and biological covariates (sex, age and medication) on exon–gene expression relationships were tested for significance. Of these individuals, 71 had participated in a published epilepsy genome-wide association study, and, therefore, genotyping data were available. Details of sample collection and genotyping quality control steps have been published previously 66 . These samples were assayed with Illumina HumanHap550v3 ( N = 44) and Illumina Human610-Quadv1 ( N = 27) arrays.

In the UK Brain Expression database, post-mortem brain tissues from 134 individuals free from neurological disorders were obtained from the MRC Sudden Death Brain Bank in Edinburgh and Sun Health Research Institute 67 . Genotype information was obtained using Illumina HumanOmni 1M arrays and standard quality control methods. Expression profiling was conducted in up to ten separate brain regions for each individual brain using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array. Expression levels were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) algorithm restricting to probe sets containing more than three probes, unique hybridization target (probes that map to a single position within the genome) and supported by evidence from EntrezGene. The average signals for all neocortex (AvgCTX) and all brain regions (AvgAll) were tested, as were individual cortical and subcortical regions. Any significant association where the probe set contained the SNP or a SNP in high LD ( r 2 > 0.50) was removed from further analysis.

SNPExpress, a publically available database, was also used for replication of the findings. The SNPExpress database 68 used autopsy-collected frontal cortex brain tissue in 93 samples from human subjects with no neuropsychiatric conditions and PBMCs in 80 samples. In this database, transcript expression levels were measured on Affymetrix Human ST 1.0 exon arrays, and genome-wide genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanHap550K arrays.

Raw gene expression data from human fetal brain were gathered from a published study 42 . Post-mortem specimens from four late mid-fetal human brains (18, 19, 21 and 23 weeks of gestation) were collected from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Details of specimens, tissue processing, microdissection and neuropathological assessment have been described elsewhere 42 .
