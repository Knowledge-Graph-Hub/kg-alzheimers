Analysis of 6,515 exomes reveals a recent origin of most human protein-coding variants

# Abstract
Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history 1 , 2 and will help facilitate the development of new approaches for disease gene discovery 3 . Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth 4 - 6 , notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, qualitatively suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European (n=4,298) and African (n=2,217) American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that ~73% of all protein-coding SNVs and ~86% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs compared to other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, illustrate the profound effect recent human history has had on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provides important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease gene discovery.

## Methods Summary
Exome sequences were obtained for 6,823 individuals, who were sequenced to high-coverage (median depth > 100x) on an Illumina GAII or HiSeq2000. Library construction, exome capture, sequencing, mapping, calling and filtering were performed as previously described, with minor modifications 6 (and see Supplementary Information ). After quality control and removal of related individuals, 6,515 individuals were retained. Ancestry of each individual was inferred by PCA performed on the sequence data. We developed a simulation approach based on coalescent theory to estimate allele age, which was applied to 1,146,401 autosomal SNVs with known ancestral states. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in Supplementary Information .
