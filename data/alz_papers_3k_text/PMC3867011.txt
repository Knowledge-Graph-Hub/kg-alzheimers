# Title
The Presenilin-1 ΔE9 mutation results in reduced
γ-secretase activity, but not total loss of PS1 function, in isogenic
human stem cells

# Abstract
Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic core of γ-secretase, which
cleaves type-1 transmembrane proteins including the amyloid precursor protein
(APP). PS1 also has γ-secretase independent functions and dominant PS1
missense mutations are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer’s
disease (FAD). Whether PS1 FAD mutations are gain or loss-of-function remains
controversial, primarily because most studies have relied on overexpression in
mouse and/or non-neuronal systems. We used isogenic euploid human iPSC lines to
generate and study an allelic series of PS1 mutations including heterozygous
null mutations and homozygous and heterozygous FAD PS1 mutations. Rigorous
analysis of this allelic series in differentiated, purified neurons allowed us
to resolve this controversy and to conclude that FAD PS1 mutations, expressed at
normal levels in the appropriate cell-type, impair γ-secretase activity,
but do not disrupt γ-secretase independent functions of PS1. Thus, FAD
PS1 mutations do not act as simple loss of PS1 function, but instead dominantly
gain an activity toxic to some, but not all PS1 functions.

## INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
that is the most common cause of dementia ( Barnes, et
al., 2011 ). Pathologically, AD is characterized by amyloid plaques
consisting of Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles composed
of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. While the precise mechanism that causes AD is
still under investigation, key proteins involved in the disease have been
identified. The Amyloid Precursor Protein ( APP ) and the presenilin
genes ( PSEN1 and PSEN2 ) are all implicated in AD
because mutations in these genes cause dominantly inherited forms of the disease.
Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a multipass transmembrane protein with multiple biological
functions. PS1 undergoes proteolytic processing ( Thinakaran, et al., 1996 ) to form N and C-terminal fragments, which then
associate with Nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 to form the γ-secretase complex
( Edbauer, et al., 2003 ). PS1 functions as
the catalytic core of γ-secretase, which cleaves type 1 transmembrane
proteins such as APP, Notch and cadherins. When APP is cleaved by
γ-secretase, the Aβ fragment, a main component of senile plaques, is
generated. In addition, PS1 has γ-secretase independent functions such as
maturation and trafficking of transmembrane proteins, including Nicastrin and TrkB
( Leem, et al., 2002 ; Naruse, et al., 1998 ), and down-regulation of
Wnt signaling through destabilization of β-catenin ( Killick, et al., 2001 ). More recently, PS1 has also been shown
to control lysosome acidification ( Lee, et al.,
2010 ; Wolfe, et al., 2013 ).

Mutations in PS1 are the most common cause of FAD, with over 100 mutations
reported to be pathogenic ( http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations , Tanzi, et al., 2005 ). The dominant amyloid cascade hypothesis
posits that FAD mutations act by increasing the formation of toxic Aβ
fragments of APP, which are generated by sequential cleavage of APP by
β-secretase and then by γ-secretase. The most abundant form (ca. 85%)
of the Aβ peptide contains 40 amino acid residues (Aβ40), with a
minority (ca. 15%) of an alternative species containing 42 amino acids, Aβ42.
FAD PS1 mutations generally increase the proportion of the Aβ42 peptide,
which is thought to be the key agent that causes the pathological changes in FAD
(Scheuner, et al.,1996). Whether PS1 mutations cause increases in Aβ42 and
therefore FAD by a gain or loss-of-function mechanism remains controversial.
Controversy persists because virtually all previous studies probing the nature of
FAD PS1 mutations have relied on experimental manipulations that overexpress PS1 and
PS1 mutants in mouse and/or non-neuronal systems ( Bentahir, et al., 2006 ; Chávez-Gutiérrez, et al., 2012 ; Kumar-Singh, et al., 2006 ) or that express mutant forms of PS1
in competition with wild-type forms in cell types that may not have normal levels of
expression of other key genes. For example, studies of cultured neurons completely
lacking PS1 results in near absence of Aβ generation suggesting that FAD PS1
mutations cause a gain-of-function ( De Strooper, et
al., 1998 ). Paradoxically, removal of PS1 from neurons in the adult mouse
brain causes neurodegeneration with aspects of neuropathology similar to that seen
in AD ( Saura, et al., 2004 ). This result led
to the suggestion that FAD PS1 mutations generate loss-of-function of PS1.
Similarly, studies using overexpression of PS1 FAD mutations are difficult to
interpret, primarily because overexpression of FAD PS1 mutants do not accurately
recapitulate normal activity and function of the PS1 protein, and because these
studies are done in non-neuronal cell types that do not express the same amounts of
key PS1 interacting proteins as in neurons. Finally, since mouse models of FAD do
not fully recapitulate the pathologies seen in human patients ( Games, et al., 1995 ; Radde, et
al., 2008 ; Ashe, et al., 2010 ),
differences between mouse and human responses to FAD PS1 mutations may be
important.

In view of the persistent controversy about the mechanism of dysfunction
caused by FAD PS1 mutations we set out to test whether a key and representative FAD
PS1 mutation, PS1 Δe9 expressed at endogenous levels in human neurons and in
an isogenic genetic background, is similar to or different from targeted PS1
haploinsuficiency. To achieve this goal we used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
technology ( Takahashi, et al., 2007 ), which
provides the opportunity to study bona fide human neuronal cells that express normal
levels of neuronal genes, proteins, and pathways. To compare the effects of specific
mutations in a controlled isogenic genetic background, we used genome-editing
technology with TAL Effector Nucleases (TALENs) ( Miller, et al., 2011 ; Sander, et al.,
2011 ) to generate and study an allelic series of PS1 mutations including
the FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutation.

This mutation lacks the PS1 endoproteolysis site, thus preventing normal PS1
cleavage during maturation, which facilitates precise quantitative determination of
the level of mutant protein in neuronal cells. We compared the phenotypic
consequences of FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutations to heterozygous PS1 null mutations,
which enabled us to rigorously conclude that the PS1 ΔE9 mutant acts as a
dominant gain-of-function mutation by poisoning intact γ-secretase enzyme
complexes in human neuronal cells.

## RESULTS
There are several genome-editing methods that have been used to edit
iPSCs, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) ( Soldner, et
al., 2011 ), TALENs ( Hockemeyer, et
al., 2011 ) and more recently the CRISPR/Cas9 system ( Mali, et al. 2013 ). We compared both ZFNs
and TALENs ( Figure S1 )
and used TALENs for our genome-editing strategy. We designed TALENs to target
the PS1 gene in the genome of iPSCs derived from J. Craig Venter ( Gore, et al., 2011 ), whose genome has been
sequenced and is publicly available ( Levy, et
al., 2007 ). The FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutation is a point mutation in
the splice acceptor consensus sequence of intron 8 that causes in-frame skipping
of exon 9 ( Perez-Tur, et al., 1995 ). To
introduce the ΔE9 point mutation, we used single stranded
oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) ( Chen, et al.,
2011 ) as the repair template with 60bp of PS1 homology on either
side. We recovered and screened 192 clonal iPSC lines using allele specific PCR
to identify lines that had the ΔE9 mutation. From 192 candidate lines, 14
lines amplified in the allele specific PCR. We cloned and sequenced the PCR
products to test whether candidate lines had incorporated 1 or 2 copies of the
ΔE9 mutation and whether candidate lines had any disruption of the PS1
gene (i.e., insertions or deletions). This analysis resulted in recovery of an
allelic series of PS1 mutations in otherwise isogenic iPSCs ( Table 1 and Figure 1A ). Although our strategy was not designed to detect iPSC
lines with disruption of the PS1 locus, we obtained 1 line with disruption of 1
PS1 allele (wt/null) caused by insertion of one nucleotide in exon 9. This
single nucleotide insertion interrupts the PS1 open reading frame, causes a
premature stop codon, and likely induces nonsense mediated decay of the PS1 mRNA
templated by this allele ( Figure 1B ). In
total, we generated 3 lines with 1 copy of the ΔE9 mutation
(wt/Δe9), and 2 lines that were homozygous for the ΔE9 mutation
(Δe9/Δe9), 2 lines with 1 allele containing the ΔE9
mutation and the other allele an insertion in exon 9 that disrupts the PS1 gene
(Δe9/null).

Since γ-secretase activity is key to many developmental pathways
( De Strooper, et al., 1999 ), we tested
whether introducing the FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutation, or disrupting one copy of
the PS1 gene affects pluripotency. Staining of iPSC lines with a typical cell
surface pluripotency marker, Tra-1-81, revealed no obvious differences between
mutant and control lines ( Figure S1F ). To test neuronal differentiation, we generated neural
progenitor cells (NPCs) from the isogenic iPSCs. Two NPC lines per genotype were
generated, with the exception of the wt/null genotype where we only obtained 1
iPSC line ( Table 1 ). We used the PA6
coculture differentiation protocol previously used in our lab ( Yuan, et al., 2011 ) along with dual SMAD
inhibition ( Chambers, et al., 2009 ) to
generate NPCs. After the 12-day differentiation period, we FACS purified the
NPCs ( Yuan, et al., 2011 ) to remove
undifferentiated cells and contaminants. We found no significant differences in
the percentage of NPCs marked by cell surface markers between the different
genotypes ( Figure S2A ).
All NPC lines we recovered exhibited typical morphology and stained positive for
the NPC marker, Nestin ( Figure
S3E ).

Recent studies suggest that reprogrammed iPSC lines can accumulate
elevated frequencies of genetic and epigenetic changes potentially owing to
reprogramming and subsequent selection during culture and expansion ( Hussein, et al., 2011 ; Gore, et al., 2011 ; Lister, et al., 2011 ). Similarly, a concern with using
genome-editing strategies such as TALENs or ZFNs is the occurrence of off-target
effects, in particular DSBs, which may generate insertions or deletions in
protein-coding regions other than those intended for targeting. Because targeted
iPSCs were subcloned after genome-editing with the TALENs in order to generate
clonal cell lines, detecting mutations due to off-target genome editing is
complicated by the potential mutational effects of the subcloning process
itself.

To address these concerns, we performed whole-exome sequencing on our
TALEN-modified iPSC lines and the parent iPSC line, and compared the resultant
mutational load to that found between non-modified iPSC subclones and human
embryonic stem cell (hESC) subclones and their iPSC and hESC parent population.
We generated three single-cell subcloned lines each for two iPSC lines (CVB and
CVI) and one hESC line (Hues 9). We analyzed the mutational load of the
protein-coding regions of the genome by performing exome sequencing on these
nine subcloned lines, the six TALEN-edited lines, and the parent iPSC and hESC
lines. We observed a very low frequency of protein-coding mutations (0-3) in
each of the subcloned lines. Additionally the number of acquired mutations did
not differ between the iPSC and hESC lines. The mutational load found in each of
the non-modified iPSC and hESC subclones ( Table
2 ) when compared to their mixed parent population was statistically
very similar to the mutational load found in the TALEN-edited subclones ( Table 3 ) when compared to their mixed
parent population (p=0.13), indicating that TALEN-based genome editing does not
introduce an additional point mutational load over subcloning. Additionally, the
edited subclones did not possess a detectable increase in indel count,
indicating that insertions and deletions due to off-target DSBs did not seem to
occur. Furthermore, the edited subclones did not possess any chromosome-level
shifts in allele ratios at known SNP sites, indicating that the edited lines are
not aneuploid. Taken together, these findings have led us to conclude that
subcloning of iPSCs is not inherently highly mutagenic and that modification
with TALENs is unlikely to cause any significant off-target effects.

Interestingly, recent work from Ding, et al., reports TALEN modification
of Hues1 hESCs. In this paper, TALEN-modified subclones also demonstrated a low
number of off-target effects as analyzed by whole exome and whole genome
sequencing. However, across the subclones this group found 24 single-nucleotide
variants in coding regions, approximately 10 times more than we found in our
experiment. The reason for this difference is puzzling, but could possibly be
due to differences in the number of passages the clones underwent prior to
subcloning, differences in the maintenance of the cells (i.e. feeders vs.
feeder-free conditions), or differences inherent to the particular cell line
used. One possibility to circumvent this discrepancy and ensure truly isogenic
cell lines would be to first subclone iPSCs or hESCs prior to genome-editing
with TALENs.

To test whether the TALEN-induced mutations had the expected molecular
effects on PS1 mRNA abundance, we harvested RNA from NPCs of each PS1 genotype
and performed qRT-PCR analysis. We found that the wt/null line exhibited
decreased PS1 mRNA to ca. 50% of normal ( Figure
1B ), which confirmed that the nucleotide insertion in exon 9 results
in loss of PS1 mRNA, likely due to nonsense mediated decay of the PS1 message.
We also observed that the wt/ΔE9 lines and the ΔE9/ΔE9
lines did not significantly differ from wt/wt lines for PS1 mRNA, while
ΔE9/null had ca. 50% of normal levels of PS1 mRNA ( Figure 1B ). To evaluate PS1 mutant effects on PS1 protein
abundance, we took advantage of the finding that PS1 undergoes endoproteolysis
to generate a 26-27 kDa N-terminal fragment and a 16-17 kDa C-terminal fragment
( Thinakaran, et al., 1996 ). Part of
the endoproteolysis site is in exon 9 of PS1 and thus an important feature of
the ΔE9 mutation is that the endoproteolysis site is destroyed.
Therefore, lines containing 1 copy of ΔE9 are predicted to generate 50%
of the cleaved product and 50% of the full-length (~44 kDa), while cells
containing two copies of ΔE9 should not generate any of the cleaved
product. Western blot analysis using a c-terminal antibody ( Figure 2C,D and E ) revealed that these lines all behaved as
predicted with wt/ΔE9 producing 50% of the uncleaved fragment,
ΔE9/ΔE9 producing 100% of the uncleaved fragment and
ΔE9/null producing only uncleaved fragment, but at 50% the level of
ΔE9/ΔE9. To further confirm that the null mutations were indeed a
true null allele and not a truncated protein with residual function, we also
performed a western blot with an N-terminal antibody ( Figure S1G,H andI ). Using
an N-terminal antibody we also observed significantly decreased protein from
cell lines harboring null PS1 alleles. Thus, based on PS1 mRNA and protein
production, we concluded that PS1 mutants induced in isogenic iPSC lines
generated the expected effects on PS1 mRNA expression, protein production, and
endoproteolysis.

APP normally undergoes several proteolytic processing events to generate
a collection of soluble APP fragments including the APP intracellular domain
(AICD) and Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides are generated when APP first
undergoes cleavage by β-secretase and then by cleavage with
γ-secretase. FAD mutations in APP, PS1, and PS2 have been shown to alter
processing of Aβ, with most mutations reported to increase the
Aβ42/40 ratio when expressed under a variety of conditions ( Qiang, et al., 2011 ; Kumar-Singh, et al., 2006 ). Since APP processing in human
neurons that generates Aβ peptides, in particular Aβ42, plays a
key role in AD pathogenesis we tested for changes in APP processing in purified
human neurons generated from isogenic human NPC lines with different PS1
mutations. Purified neurons were generated by differentiating NPCs for 3 weeks
followed by FACS purification ( Yuan, et al.,
2011 ). We found no significant differences in the percentage of
neurons generated between the different genotypes ( Figure S2B ). We used a
highly sensitive assay ( Israel, et al.,
2012 ) to measure Aβ 38, 40 and 42 species from purified cells
and progenitors. We found that cell lines harboring one copy of ΔE9
significantly increased the secreted Aβ42/40 ratio, by two-fold, compared
to the wt/wt lines ( Figure 2A and B ). Two
copies of ΔE9 increased the 42/40 ratio 3-fold over wt/wt lines, and
similarly, ΔE9/null lines also tripled the 42/40 ratio over wt/wt.
Interestingly, wt/null was not significantly different from wt/wt, demonstrating
that loss of one copy of PS1 does not mimic the ΔE9 mutation.

We used purified neurons to investigate whether the ΔE9 mutation
increases the Aβ42/40 ratio by decreasing Aβ40, increasing
Aβ42, or both. We observed that the wt/null genotype was not
significantly different from wt/wt for Aβ40 ( Figure 2C ). However, all genotypes containing even a single
copy of Δe9, wt/Δe9, Δe9/Δe9 and Δe9/null,
had significantly decreased Aβ40 ( Figure
2C ). There were no significant differences between wt/null and
wt/Δe9 in the amount of Aβ42, however, Δe9/Δe9 and
Δe9/null genotypes displayed significantly increased amounts of
Aβ42 ( Figure 2D ). Therefore, we
conclude that PS1 ΔE9, expressed at endogenous levels in human neurons,
increases the Aβ42/40 ratio by decreasing Aβ40 and increasing
Aβ42. Additionally, we determined that loss of one PS1 allele does not
significantly alter Aβ production and in particular did not affect the
Aβ42/40 ratio.

Finally, to test whether PS1 ΔE9 affects tau phosphorylation, the
other major pathological hallmark of AD, we measured phospho-tau at site Thr231,
a site that correlates with neurofibrillary tangle number ( Buerger, et al., 2006 ). We did not observe any significant
differences in the ratio of P-tau/T-tau between any of the PS1 genotypes ( Figure S2D ).

To determine directly whether the ΔE9 mutation impairs
γ-secretase mediated processing of different protein substrates, we
measured the cleavage of the C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP and N-cadherin,
both of which are γ-secretase substrates. Ordinarily, APP first undergoes
cleavage by α and β secretases, which yield α and β
CTFs, and then γ-secretase further cleaves the α and β
CTFs. Similarly, N-cadherin undergoes an initial proteolytic processing event,
which generates a CTF that is also cleaved by γ-secretase. Therefore, if
the ΔE9 mutation impairs γ-secretase activity, we would expect to
see an increase in APP and N-cadherin CTFs. All lines containing at least one
copy of ΔE9 had significantly increased APP CTFs over wt/wt ( Figure 3A and B ). We also quantified
full-length APP and observed no significant differences between genotypes ( Figure S2A ). This
suggests that the ΔE9 mutation does impair γ-secretase cleavage of
APP CTFs. Similarly, we were unable to detect any N-cadherin CTF for wt/wt,
wt/null and wt/ΔE9 genotypes, but did observe obviously elevated levels
of CTFs in Δe9/Δe9 lines and Δe9/null lines ( Figure 3C ). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that the ΔE9 mutation expressed at endogenous levels in a
normal genetic background in human neurons impairs γ-secretase
activity.

Previous studies reported that low doses of γ-secretase
inhibitors that moderately impaired γ-secretase function increase the
Aβ42/40 ratio in a variety of cell types ( Sato, et al., 2003 , Shen, et al.,
2007 ). Thus, as an additional test of whether the ΔE9 mutation
decreases γ-secretase activity in purified euploid human neurons, we
compared the effects of the ΔE9 mutation to a low dose of the
γ-secretase inhibitor, Compound E. Similar to previous reports, we found
that a high dose of γ-secretase inhibitor (200nM) completely inhibits all
Aβ production (data not shown) in all genotypes. Strikingly, a low dose
(5nM) of Compound E substantially increases the Aβ42/40 ratio in wt/wt,
wt/null, and wt/ΔE9 neurons, but not in ΔE9/ΔE9 or
ΔE9/null ( Figure 3D ). Thus, the
ΔE9 mutation has a similar phenotypic impact on Aβ processing as
direct and low level inhibition of γ-secretase. Surprisingly, the
ΔE9 mutation appears to confer resistance to low dose inhibition of
γ-secretase activity by Compound E.

To further probe whether the ΔE9 mutation acts as a loss or
gain-of-function, we asked whether the ΔE9 mutation interferes with a
γ-secretase independent function of PS1, Nicastrin maturation. Wild-type
PS1 has been reported to facilitate Nicastrin maturation by acting as a
chaperone in early biosynthetic compartments ( Leem, et al., 2002 ). Thus, we quantified the relative amounts of
mature and immature Nicastrin in purified neurons with various PS1 genotypes by
quantitative western blot ( Figure 4A and
B ). We found that the ratio of mature/immature Nicastrin was
significantly decreased compared to wt/wt only in cell lines that harbor a PS1
null mutation (wt/null and Δe9/null). There were no significant
differences in mature/immature Nicastrin between wt/wt, wt/Δe9 and
Δe9/Δe9 genotypes. This result suggests that the ΔE9
mutation does not impair all γ-secretase independent functions of PS1
since it generates a phenotypic effect that is clearly different from a null
allele ( Figure 4C ).

## DISCUSSION
Based on direct quantitative biochemical comparisons, our results
demonstrate that the phenotypic effects of a proven null PS1 mutation and an FAD PS1
ΔE9 mutation are not equivalent in isogenic euploid purified human neurons.
In addition, the ΔE9 allele inhibits aspects of γ-secretase activity
while maintaining normal activity for at least one γ-secretase independent
function, nicastrin maturation. Thus, by using carefully genetically engineered
human cells, this series of experiments reveals that some, and we propose, by
extension, all PS1 FAD mutations are not simple loss-of-function alleles with
respect to the biochemical pathway that generates key phenotypes associated with the
initiation and development of AD.

Previous experiments probing whether the PS1 ΔE9 mutation changes the
Aβ42/40 ratio by increasing Aβ42, decreasing Aβ40, or both have
been reported multiple times with contradictory results ( Chávez-Gutiérrez, et al., 2012 ; Kumar-Singh, et al., 2006 ). This issue is
important since determining how the FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutation changes the ratio of
Aβ species in euploid human neurons may help to elucidate AD mechanisms and
inform development of effective AD drugs. By taking advantage of the allelic series
we generated in a controlled genetic background in purified human neurons we were
able to determine that the ΔE9 mutation increases the Aβ42/40 ratio in
a gene dosage dependent manner by significantly decreasing the amount of Aβ40
while moderately increasing the amount of Aβ42. Our results are in contrast
to some but not all previous attempts to clarify this issue. For example, a number
of previous analyses of FAD PS1 mutations used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or
HEK cells overexpressing PS1 ΔE9; some experiments incorporated additional
overexpression of human APP and APP mutations. These studies are complex to
interpret since it is unknown whether overexpression of PS1 ΔE9 results in
biochemical data accurately representing the normal activity of PS1. An alternative
approach is defined by early studies in C.elegans , which suggested
that FAD PS1 mutations encode PS1 proteins with decreased activity compared to wt
PS1 ( Shen, et al., 1997 ). Early studies in
HEK cells treated with antisense PS1 RNA showed increased secretion of Aβ42
( Refolo, et al., 1999 ), which also
supported the idea that PS1 mutations are simple loss-of-function. Later studies
from knockout mice suggested that PS1 mutations are gain-of-function because
complete loss of PS1 resulted in severely decreased overall Aβ production,
unlike PS1 mutations. More recent studies propose that many PS1 mutations have
decreased γ-secretase activity ( Bentahir, et
al., 2006 ; Koch, et al., 2012 ; Heilig, et al., 2010 ) A common issue
among these studies is that evaluation of Aβ production in non-human and/or
non-neuronal cells may not be ideal because Aβ production and factors
influencing Aβ production vary significantly among cell types ( Qiang, et al., 2011 ; Israel, et al., 2012 ) and in comparison to neurons, which are
the primary cell type affected in AD. Although these differences among cell types
and systems might not have large scale effects, AD itself and AD phenotypes can be
generated by relatively minor changes in expression of key genes, e.g., a 50% dosage
increase of APP itself is sufficient to generate severe early-onset FAD ( Rovelet-Lecrux, et al., 2006 ). Our system using
genetically manipulated isogenic iPSC-derived neurons avoids these problems, allows
effects of relatively minor magnitude to be evaluated, and in principle avoids
problems of uncontrolled dosage at other key loci.

We note that until the work reported here, a complete and direct comparison
of γ-secretase dependent and independent functions generated by an FAD PS1
mutation and a null allele has not been reported. Strikingly, PS1 haploinsuficiency
had no significant effect on the Aβ42/40 ratio or total levels of Aβ40
and Aβ42, which again demonstrates that PS1 loss-of-function and PS1
ΔE9 are not equivalent with respect to Aβ production and CTF
processing. Thus, our finding confirms that the ΔE9 mutation is not simply a
complete loss of PS1 function because the ΔE9 mutation has decreased
γ-secretase activity compared to wt PS1 and heterozygous null allele, but has
no affect on Nicastrin maturation, a γ-secretase independent function of PS1.
In fact, we found impaired Nicastrin maturation only in cell lines that harbored a
PS1 null mutation, which further confirms that PS1 ΔE9 maintains at least
some normal PS1 functions. Furthermore, we found that PS1 haploinsuficiency had no
detectable effect on APP or N-cadherin cleavage, again suggesting that PS1
haploinsuficiency and PS1 ΔE9 do not have the same effect on
γ-secretase activity. Our findings also suggest that under the physiological
conditions of our studies, and with respect to the phenotypes measured,
γ-secretase activity is available in excess, because loss of one PS1 allele
did not significantly alter γ-secretase cleavage of APP or N-cadherin.

In addition to testing how total levels of Aβ and the Aβ 42/40
ratio responded to different PS1 genotypes, we also measured phosphorylation of tau
at Thr231. We did not observe any significant differences in the ratio of tau
phosphorylated at Thr231 relative to total tau, when any of our PS1 mutants or
combinations were compared to wt PS1, even in cell lines that were homozygous for
the ΔE9 mutation and had significantly increased Aβ42. This result is
similar to recent studies of neurons made from IPSCs carrying two different
presenilin mutants, PS1 A246E and PS2 N141I ( Yagi et
al., 2011 ) but is in contrast to previous studies of iPSC-derived neurons
from FAD caused by an APP duplication ( Israel, et
al., 2012 ) or trisomy 21 ( Shi et al.,
2012 ), both of which reported an increase in the ratio of phosphorylated
tau relative to total tau. An intriguing possibility is that FAD caused by an extra
copy of APP and FAD caused by PS1 mutations differ in the earliest phenotypes and
mechanisms by which they cause disease and thus differ in their induction of
abnormal levels of phospho-tau. In this context, there is evidence that different
FAD mutations result in positional and temporal differences in tau phosphorylation
and accumulation. Specifically, analyses of post-mortem AD tissue revealed that
different PS1 mutations ( Shepherd et al,
2004 ) affect tau deposition and phosphorylation differentially with mutations
in PS1 exons 8 and 9 having less hyperphosphorylated tau than mutations in exons 5
and 6. Further studies in iPSC-derived neurons, either with genome modifications or
derived from patients with specific FAD mutations will clarify the nature of tau
phenotypes in different FAD mutants.

A major focus of AD therapeutics has been γ-secretase inhibition,
which has thus far failed to perform as hoped in clinical trials ( Opar, 2008 ). In some cases, γ-secretase
inhibition has even accelerated cognitive decline ( Extance, 2010 ). Our data suggest that γ-secretase inhibition
could worsen patients either by increasing the proportion of Aβ42 or by
increasing the amount of APP CTFs, which have been proposed to play a role in AD
pathogenesis ( Rodrigues, et al., 2012 ; Jiang, et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, our recent
work in an IPSC derived human neuronal system ( Israel, et al., 2012 ) suggested that the β-CTF of APP is toxic in
purified FAD neurons since treatment with a β-secretase inhibitor, rather
than a γ-secretase inhibitor reduced abnormal phospho-tau levels in these FAD
neurons. Since the FAD PS1 ΔE9 mutation decreases the amount of Aβ40
in our system and increases the APP CTFs, it is possible that this class of FAD
mutation confers its toxic properties, in part, by the accumulation of other
pathogenic APP fragments such as the APP CTF. Thus a potentially important
therapeutic implication from our work is that γ-secretase modulation that
restores the Aβ ratios and/or restores γ-secretase function to normal
levels or character could be more beneficial for AD treatment. Future studies
characterizing other PS1 functions that may be affected by drugs and mutations will
also be important for designing AD therapeutics.

A final important implication emerging from the work we report here concerns
the question of whether TALENs introduce significant off-target mutations in iPSCs.
By performing exome sequencing on genome-edited and subcloned iPSC lines we found
that the genome-edited lines did not have a significantly higher number of unique
mutations beyond what we observed in simple IPSC or hESC subcloning experiments.
Thus, the introduction of TALENs does not appear to cause major off-target mutagenic
effects. Another recent publication ( Ding, et al.,
2013 ) reported that exome and whole genome sequencing on TALEN-targeted
hESC lines revealed mutations unique to different subclones, although at an
apparently higher frequency than we report here, possibly due to inherent
differences in the particular cell line used or in the number of passages the clones
underwent prior to subcloning. Taken together these data suggest that it may be
impossible to derive completely isogenic cell lines. However, the relative number of
single nucleotide variants between TALEN-targeted lines is still apparently less
than what would be observed between different individual human genomes. Finally, as
we report here, the generation of an allelic series and the analysis of multiple
independent lines allows for careful evaluation of phenotypic effects in a bona
fide, euploid, cell-type representative human model.

## EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
iPSCs were generated as previously described ( Gore, et al., 2011 ; Israel,
et al., 2012 ). iPSCs are cultured on an irradiated MEF feeder layer
generated in-house. Cells are grown in medium containing KO DMEM (Gibco), 10%
Plasmanate (Talecris Biotherapeutics), 10% KO Serum Replacement (Gibco), 20mM
GlutaMax (Invitrogen), 20mM NEAA (Invitrogen), 20mM Pen/Strep (Invitrogen) and
20ng/uL FGF (Millipore). Cells were passaged by dissociation with Accutase
(Innovative Cell Technologies).

iPSCs were pretreated with 10uM Rock Inhibitor (Ascent Scientific) for 1
hour prior to nucleofection. Cells were dissociated using accutase and passed
through a 100uM filter to obtain single cells. Two million iPSCs were
nucleofected using Amaxa Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 (Lonza), with 7.5ug
of each TALEN-encoding plasmid, 2ug of pmaxGFP (Lonza) and 30ug of ssODN
(Integrated DNA Technologies). Cells were maintained in iPSC culture conditions
with 10uM Rock inhibitor for 72 hours followed by FACS sorting (FACS Aria, BD
Biosciences) for GFP+ cells. GFP-expressing cells were plated a
1×10 4 cells per 10cm plate in the presence of Rock
Inhibitor. Thereafter, media was changed every other day until isolated colonies
grew. Isolated colonies were manually picked and grown in 96-well plates. Once
cells were confluent, cells were split into a duplicate well and grown until
confluent at which point they were harvested for DNA using DNA QuickExtract
(Epicentre). DNA was amplified using allele specific primers to detect the
ΔE9 point mutation using Jump Start PCR Ready Mix (Sigma). Cell lines
that amplified using the allele specific PCR were then digested with EcoRI to
further confirm insertion of the ssODN. To sequence the PCR products, we cloned
them using the Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen).

Exome sequencing was performed as previously described ( Gore, et al., 2011 ). Briefly, genomic DNA
from each sample was sheared and ligated to barcoded Illumina sequencing
adaptors. DNA was then hybridized using the Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome
library to capture exomic regions. Exome regions were captured with
streptavidin-coated beads and then PCR-amplified with Illumina sequencing
adaptors. The resulting libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer
IIx or Illumina Hiseq. Reads were mapped to the whole genome using BWA, and a
consensus sequence was generated using GATK (Broad Institute best practices).
Consensus sequences between the progenitor cell lines and subcloned cell lines
were compared to look for candidate novel mutations. Candidate variants that
occurred at locations present in the dbSNP database or that showed any presence
in the progenitor line were removed. Identified candidate mutations were
validated by Sanger sequencing.

To determine if TALEN modification resulted in an increased off-target
point mutational load, the number of mutations in the TALEN-modified subcloned
iPSC lines was compared to the number of mutations in the unmodified subcloned
pluripotent stem cell lines. In order to analyze the potential mutational load
introduced by the TALEN process itself and exclude any normal culture mutations,
the number of mutations acquired after subcloning was analyzed rather than any
overall iPSC mutations acquired due to reprogramming or post-reprogramming
culture. Because of the varied culture history of each progenitor line and
subclone, it was difficult to construct a hypothetical mutational distribution
for each line. Thus, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the
median number of mutations in each subclone group. The test revealed that
TALEN-modified and unmodified subclones had a similar median number of
mutations; no significant difference could be determined (p=0.13). This
indicates that TALEN-modified lines do not acquire any additional mutational
load over that expected during normal culture and subcloning.

iPSCs were differentiated to NPCs as previously described ( Yuan, et al., 2011 ). Briefly,
1×10 5 iPSCs were seeded onto PA6 cells in PA6
differentiation medium: Glasgow DMEM, 10% KOSR, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 0.1mM
Nonessential Amino Acids and 0.1 mM β-Mercaptoethanol (all from
Invitrogen). For the first 6 days media was not changed and also contained 500
ng/ml Noggin (R&D Systems) and 10 μM SB431542 (Tocris). After the
first 6 days, medium was changed every other day until day 12. On day 12, cells
were dissociated and stained with, CD184, CD44, CD271 and CD24 (all from BD
Biosciences). CD184 +, CD24+, CD44-, CD271- cells were sorted (FACS Aria, BD
Biosciences). NPC cultures were cultured on 20 μg/ml poly-L-ornithine and
5 μg/ml laminin (both from Sigma) coated plates in medium containing:
DMEM:F12 + Glutamax, 0.5X N2, 0.5X B27 (both from Life Technologies), 1X P/S,
and 20 ng/ml FGF (Millipore). Media was changed every other day.

NPCs were expanded to 10cm plates and grown to confluency (3-4 days) at
which point FGF was removed from the media. The medium was changed twice per
week and the cells were differentiated for 21 days. After the 3 week
differentiation, neurons were purified as previously described ( Yuan, et al., 2011 ). Briefly, cells were
dissociated using Accutase and Accumax (both from Innovative Cell Technologies)
and then stained with CD184, CD44 and CD24 (all from BD Biosciences). CD184-,
CD44-, CD24+ cells were sorted (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences) and then plated on
polyornithine/laminin coated plates in NPC media + 0.5mM dbCAMP (Sigma), 20ng/uL
BDNF and 20ng/uL GDNF (both from Peprotech).

For mRNA expression analysis, total RNA was prepared using RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). The RNA was DNase treated (Ambion) and first-strand cDNA synthesis was
performed with Superscript (Invitrogen). qPCR was done on a Applied Biosystems
7300 real time PCR system using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche).
Results were quantified using the ΔΔC t method. PS1
levels were normalized to the house-keeping genes TATA-binding protein (TBP) or
the ribosomal protein RPL27. Primers for PS1 spanned exons 4 and 5. Forward
Primer: TGACTCTCTGCATGGTGGTGG; Reverse Primer: TCTCTGGCCCACAGTCTCGGT

NPCs were plated at a density of 5×10 5 in 12 well
plates. Media was changed 24 hours after plating and replaced with 0.5mL of NPC
media + FGF. After 48 hours, media was harvested and stored at -80 and protein
was harvested for normalization purposes. Neurons were plated at density of
1.5×10 5 per 96 well in a 100uL volume of glial conditioned
media. Media was harvested from purified neurons after 2 weeks. Glial
conditioned medium was made by putting NPC media onto glia (Lonza) for 24 hours.
Aβ from the media was measured with MSD Human (6E10) Abeta3-Plex Kits
(Meso Scale Discovery). For experiments with γ-secretase inhibitor, all
media was changed on day 3 and replaced with 100uL of media either with Compound
E or DMSO (vehicle). All media was harvested on day 5. Compound E (EMD
Chemicals) was used at concentrations of 5nM and 200nM. 3-6 independent
measurements were made per line. Each NPC line was differentiated twice in
independent experiments for purified neurons.

Tissue culture lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore)
supplemented with protease (cocktail set I, Calbiochem) and phosphatase (Halt,
Pierce) inhibitors. The BCA assay (Pierce) was used to estimate the protein
content. Equal protein amounts were separated in MES buffer alongside Novex
Sharp prestained markers (Invitrogen) on NUPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris precast
gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or
nitrocellulose (0.45 μm pore size Immobilon Millipore). Membranes were
blocked in 5% BSA in tris buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 or Odyssey Blocking
Buffer (Li-Cor). Primary antibodies (Presenilin 1 c-loop 1:1000 Chemicon;
Presenilin 1 N-term 1:1000 Santa Cruz; APP C-terminus 1:1000 Calbiochem;
N-cadherin C-terminus 1:1000 BD Biosciences; Nicastrin 1:1000 Affinity
BioReagents; Actin C4 1:100,000 Chemicon; Tubulin-alpha DM1A 1:50,000 Sigma)
were prepared in 5% BSA. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (LiCor) were diluted
1:5000. LiCor Odyssey infrared imager was used to measure pixel intensities of
bands at detector settings set at the maximum or one half unit below saturation.
For each protein band, background subtracted integrated intensity values were
calculated using the Odyssey software. Since absolute integrated intensity
values vary for the same samples on different blots, samples within a blot were
plotted relative to control and these normalized values were used to average
replicates from separate blots. To show protein bands in the conventional manner
with dark bands on a light background, grayscale images were inverted in the
figures. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:5000.
Blots were developed using ECL Western Blotting Kit (Pierce).

All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad).
Statistical analysis comparing different genotypes was performed by
Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Drug responses were compared to
controls by Dunnett’s test.
