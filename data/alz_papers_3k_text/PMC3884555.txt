Selective Worsening of Brain Injury Biomarker Abnormalities in Cognitively Normal Elderly with β-amyloidosis

# Abstract
The appearance of β-amyloidosis and brain injury biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN) persons is thought to define risk for the future development of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but their interaction is poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that the joint presence of β-amyloidosis and brain injury biomarkers would lead to more rapid neurodegeneration. Longitudinal Cohort Study Population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. 191 CN persons (median age 77, range 71–93) in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent MR, FDG PET and PiB PET imaging at least twice 15 months apart. Subjects were grouped according to the recommendations of the NIA-AA Preclinical AD criteria, based on the presence of β-amyloidosis, defined as a PiB PET SUVr >1.5, alone (Stage 1) or with brain injury (stage 2+3), defined as hippocampal atrophy or FDG hypometabolism. We also studied a group of MCI (n=17) and dementia (n=9) patients from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Mayo Alzheimer Center with similar follow-up times who had had comparable imaging and who all had PiB PET SUVr >1.5. Rate of change of cortical volume on volumetric MR scans and rate of change of glucose metabolism on FDG PET scans. There were 25 CN subjects with both high PiB retention and low hippocampal volume or FDG hypometabolism at baseline (Preclinical AD stages 2+3). On follow-up scans, the Preclinical AD stages 2+3 subjects had greater loss of medial temporal lobe volume and greater glucose hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe compared to other CN groups. The changes were similar to the cognitively impaired participants. Extra-temporal regions did not show similar changes. Higher rates of medial temporal neurodegeneration occurred in CN individuals who, on their initial scans, had abnormal levels of both β-amyloid and brain injury biomarkers.

## Methods
Participants in the study were CN subjects from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) who had undergone serial brain imaging with MR and PET beginning in 2006 and continuing to the present at intervals of approximately 15 months 10 , 12 . One hundred ninety-one individuals had serial MR and PET scanning: 166 had 2 scans, 24 had 3 scans, and 1 had 4 scans. Recruitment 13 , prevalence 14 and incidence 15 of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for the parent study have been published.

We also selected 17 MCI subjects from the MCSA who met diagnostic criteria for MCI 16 due to AD by clinical criteria, and had abnormal PIB PET scans (SUVr > 1.5) and serial imaging at intervals of approximately 15 months. Of the 17 MCI subjects, 13 had 2 scans and 3 had 3 scans.

From subjects enrolled in the Mayo Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC or MCSA, we identified subjects over age 70 years with serial MR and PET scans who met diagnostic criteria for dementia due to AD by clinical criteria 17 and, had abnormal PiB PET scans. ADRC visits were approximately 12 months apart. Of the 9 AD subjects, 5 had 2 scans, 2 had 2 scans, and 2 had 3 scans.

All study protocols were approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center Institutional Review Boards, and all cognitively normal subjects provided signed informed consent to participate in the study and in the imaging protocols. In participants with cognitive impairment, they and their accompanying family member jointly provided consent.

The participants in this study were diagnosed as being CN, or having MCI or dementia through a consensus process that used information from three sources: mental status examinations performed by study physicians, Clinical Dementia Rating completed by trained study coordinators that included interview of an informant as well as the participant, and a psychometric battery previously described for the CN group 13 – 15 and for the Mayo ADRC 18 .

Imaging methods for structural MR, FDG PET and PiB PET were identical to those described previously 10 , 12 , 19 . We used these imaging modalities to operationalize the preclinical AD groupings: PiB PET imaging for defining abnormal brain β-amyloidosis and structural MR measurement of hippocampal atrophy or FDG PET for glucose hypometabolism for defining abnormal neurodegeneration.

Amyloid PET images were acquired using a GE Discovery RX PET/CT scanner. Subjects are injected with 292–729 MBq 11 C PiB. The PiB PET scan consisting of four 5-minute dynamic frames and was acquired 40 minutes after injection 20 , 21 . FDG-PET images were obtained on the same day one hour after the PiB PET scan. A CT image was obtained for attenuation correction. Subjects were injected with 366–399 MBq of FDG, and imaged after 30–38 minutes, for an 8-minute image acquisition consisting of four 2-minute dynamic frames.

Quantitative image analysis for both PiB PET and FDG PET were performed using our in-house fully automated image processing pipeline 19 , 22 . Statistics on image voxel values were extracted from automatically labeled cortical regions of interest (ROIs) using an atlas 23 modified in-house. A cortical PiB PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) was formed by combining the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate/precuneus ROI values normalized by the cerebellar gray matter ROI of the atlas. FDG PET scans were analyzed in a similar manner using angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal cortical ROIs to define an “Alzheimer signature composite” 24 , normalized to pons and vermis. In addition to this AD composite ROI, we examined individual FDG PET ROIs defined by the atlas.

All subjects underwent MR scanning at 3T with a standardized protocol that included a 3D-MPRAGE sequence 19 . MPRAGE images were corrected for image distortion and bias field 25 as previously described 19 . For preclinical staging purposes, hippocampal volume was measured with FreeSurfer software (version 4.5) 26 . and each subject’s raw hippocampal volume was adjusted by their total intracranial volume 27 . We examined annual change in FreeSurfer hippocampal volume as well as annual change in regional grey matter (GM) volumes from the in-house atlas described above.

As previously described, we chose the cutpoints for each imaging biomarker that corresponded to 90% sensitivity in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD dementia from the Mayo ADRC. For abnormal brain β-amyloidosis, a requirement for all stages of the preclinical criteria, we used the cutpoint for the PiB PET global cortical ratio of 1.5. For the markers of brain injury required for stages 2 and 3, subjects were classified as having brain injury if they had abnormal hippocampal atrophy or abnormal FDG PET hypometabolism. The 90% sensitivity cutpoint for hippocampal volume adjusted for total intracranial volume was −0.70 cm 3 . which is interpreted as 0.7 cm 3 below the normative average after accounting for head size. For the FDG PET glucose metabolism ratio of the “AD signature” composite, the cut-point value for hypometabolism was 1.31.

CN subjects were divided into 4 groups based on the biomarker cutpoints described above: all biomarkers normal (stage 0), abnormal brain β-amyloidosis only (preclinAD stage 1), abnormal brain β-amyloidosis and brain injury without regard to cognitive test scores (preclinAD stage 2 + 3), and normal brain β-amyloidosis with brain injury without regard to cognitive test scores (suspected non-AD pathophysiology, “sNAP” group). A small group of subjects not classified (n=5) as stage 0, preclinAD stages 1–3 or sNAP were excluded from analyses 12 .

We fit linear regression models within each subject to estimate the annual change in grey matter volumes and FDG metabolism using all available time points. Using all available time points in participants with more than two scans provides more stable estimates of rates of change. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess pairwise differences in annual change between the biomarker-defined groups. We report differences in regional volumes in cm 3 and in glucose metabolism in SUVr. We did not adjust p values for multiple testing.

## Results
The demographic features of the 191 CN participants with a median age of 77 (range: 71–93) are shown in Table 1 by PreclinAD stage and sNAP group. Seventeen MCI due to AD and 9 AD dementia participants are also shown in Table 1 . The ages of all groups except CN stage 0 were comparable, and there was a higher proportion of APOE e4 genotype in PreclinAD stages 1 and 2+3 compared to CN stage 0 and sNAP. The lower baseline hippocampal volumes and glucose metabolic rates in the AD signature regions in CN preclinAD stages 2 + 3 and sNAP groups were by design based on how those groups were defined. The comparable or lower values in MCI and dementia groups were expected 5 . Compared to CN participants who were part of the study group with imaging at baseline that we previously reported 10 , the current group (the vast majority of whom were included in the prior study) had a comparable overall rate of decline to MCI (13% vs 10%). Rates of MCI conversion were estimated using only the next follow-up visit which was done approximately 15 months after the baseline visit. In the current group, the rate of conversion to MCI among preclinAD stages 2+3 (21%) was higher than the biomarker negative group (Stage 0, 7%), but not significantly different from preclinAD stage 1 (19%) or the sNAP group (16%).

We evaluated annual change in GM volume for the hippocampal formations in each group. As can be seen in Figure 1 , the annualized rate of volume loss in the hippocampal formations in preclinAD stages 2+3 exceeded that of stage 0 (p=0.001), stage 1 (p=0.005) and sNAP (p=0.003) groups by about 0.1 cm 3 /y on average. The rate of change in GM volume for the hippocampal formations in preclinAD stages 2+3 was comparable and not significantly different than that seen in participants with MCI. The rate of change in the preclinAD stages 2+3 was greater than in the group with dementia presumed due to AD, though this difference was not significant (p=0.10). There were no differences in annual rate of change between stage 0, preclinAD stage 1 and the sNAP group. Although there were group differences in baseline hippocampal volume, by design, even after adjusting for baseline differences in hippocampal volume and age, we still saw greater rate of volume loss in the preclinAD stages 2+3 group compared to the other CN groups ( Table 1 ).

We also examined GM volume loss in 19 other regions of interest of which we selected 6 regions for display in Figure 2 . The medial temporal region showed similar results to the hippocampus alone, with the greatest rate of volume loss in the preclinAD stages 2+3 compared to stage 0 (p=0.004), stage 1 (p=0.02), and sNAP (p=0.03). A lateral temporal ROI had greater rate of volume loss in preclinAD stages 2+3 compared to stage 0 (p=0.008) and the sNAP group (p=0.02) but not preclinAD stage 1 (p=0.19). In the insula (p=0.007) and primary visual cortex (p=0.04), the sNAP group had a lower rate of volume loss than preclinAD stages 2+3. None of the other regions showed significant differences between any CN groups.

Examination of differences in annual rate of change in glucose utilization in the AD signature ROI ( Figure 3 ) failed to show any group differences in the AD signature region in the CN participants, although greater declines in glucose utilization were seen in this group of ROI’s in the MCI and dementia participants. However, in examining individual brain regions (6 selected regions are shown in Figure 4 ), we found greater decline in glucose metabolism in the medial temporal region in preclinAD stages 2+3 compared to stage 0 (p=0.02) and sNAP (p=0.01), with a trend towards a difference from stage 1 (p=0.10). None of the other 18 regions showed significant differences in rate of change in FDG metabolism between preclinAD stages 2+3 and the other CN groups.

## Discussion
While all of our biomarker-defined subgroups of cognitively normal persons experienced some worsening of brain injury imaging biomarkers, it was only in those who had both levels of β-amyloidosis and brain injury (preclinAD stages 2+3) meeting criteria for “Alzheimer-like” at baseline that greater brain atrophy and glucose hypometabolism occurred. The structural and metabolic changes were limited to the medial temporal lobe. Interactions between β-amyloid and neurodegenerative changes in medial temporal lobe might represent an important antecedent event to the transition from cognitive normality to overt cognitive impairment in AD. In contrast, extra-temporal regions were not changing at this stage of AD pathophysiology.

Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that β-amyloidosis accelerates neurodegenerative changes in elderly CN individuals who already have some degree of brain injury. As we suggested recently 9 and others postulated previously 28 , 29 , neurodegenerative changes (including but not limited to tauopathy) arise independently of β-amyloidosis, but β-amyloidosis may be necessary to transform the neurodegeneration into a self-propagating process. The presence of the abnormal levels of β-amyloid alone (preclinAD stage 1) did not result in greater hippocampal atrophy or glucose hypometabolism than those CN participants in stage 0. Perhaps if we had much longer observation periods, or if we had studied persons with dominantly inherited AD 1 , the relationship might be seen differently. The presence of brain injury alone, as occurred in the CN sNAP group, was also not associated with a higher rate of brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism.

The annual percent changes in hippocampal volume that we observed in the preclinAD stages 2+3 group (−3.5%) and the MCI groups (−3.6%) were nearly identical to that reported in MCI subjects in ADNI 5 and in our prior work 30 . Our small group of AD dementia patients showed a lower rate of hippocampal volume loss than expected, despite the fact that they all had elevated PiB SUVr, low baseline glucose hypometabolism and a large decline in glucose metabolism over the followup.

Over a quarter of our CN participants had glucose hypometabolism of a magnitude seen in typical AD dementia patients (a value in line with two other large studies 31 ). Although we did not observe excess declines in glucose metabolism in the AD signature composite region, our follow-up analyses revealed excess hypometabolic changes in the medial temporal lobe in the preclinAD 2+3 group compared to the sNAP and stage 0 groups. Just like the structural imaging findings, changes in FDG PET were regionally circumscribed.

Our findings, using imaging to define risk status in CN participants, replicated and expanded an analysis in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid 1–42 and tau were used for defining risk groups. Among 107 CN participants in the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), entorhinal cortex atrophy occurred when there was low CSF β-amyloid 1–42 together with elevations of tau 181p 32 . The same result could be inferred from a prior ADNI analysis 33 . One other study of note stratified subjects only by amyloid status, and did not provide data on brain injury biomarker status. An analysis of 74 elders (mean age 76.6 yrs) from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study found that atrophy rates in cortical regions including the temporal lobe and posterior cingulate-precuneus were higher in those who had a PiB SUVr of >1.4 34 .

Reductions in hippocampal volume occur in CN persons destined to develop MCI 35 – 37 or in those with MCI who progress to dementia 38 . In persons with dominantly inherited AD, atrophy in the hippocampus occurs years before clinical symptoms appear 1 , 39 , 40 and precede changes in isocortex 39 , 40 . Other biomarkers such as CSF tau protein levels might change even earlier than hippocampal volume 1 , but we lacked CSF analyses in our cohort. Our findings extend prior observations by showing that the rate of medial temporal atrophy in CN individuals was greater in one particular biomarker-defined subgroup, those persons with both β-amyloidosis and brain injury.

We are not aware of any prior longitudinal studies of FDG PET in CN individuals in whom amyloid biomarkers were used to stratify subjects. However, the findings from other cohorts support the claim that larger changes in FDG PET in extra-temporal regions occur only after persons become symptomatic. In the ADNI cohort, the rate of change of hypometabolism in the AD signature region was highest in dementia due to AD, and least in CN participants 5 , 24 . To be sure, there were declines in the CN group in ADNI, but their rate was less than a fifth of that seen in AD dementia. Another study noted that worsening FDG hypometabolism can be detected in persons with MCI who progressed to dementia in contrast to stable MCI subjects 41 , but without knowledge of amyloid status, we cannot directly compare our findings.

The mechanism by which β-amyloidosis induces neurodegeneration is a matter of intense debate, and speculation is beyond the scope of this report. Many possibilities are on the table, but defective clearance seems most plausible. The joint presence of high levels of β-amyloid and tau in the entorhinal cortex 42 , 43 or adjacent inferior temporal isocortex 44 might overwhelm the ubiquitin-proteosomal and lysosomal-autophagy systems 6 , 45 . Such a failure would allow damaged proteins to remain in the neuronal cytoplasm, thus enabling aggregation of tau into insoluble polymers 46 .

In the sNAP group, two regions – insula and primary visual cortex – showed less longitudinal decline in volume in the sNAP group compared to preclinAD stages 1 and 2+3. We are uncertain of the implications of resistance to brain atrophy in these regions in non-AD pathophysiologies, but the slower changes are in contrast to the lack of difference compared to preclinAD in baseline GM volumes in these regions that we observed previously in the sNAP group 9 .

Limitations of our study should be noted. The number of subjects in preclinAD stages 2 + 3 was small, and the median follow-up was only 1.3 years. There should be caution in drawing comparisons between different types of biomarkers for hippocampal atrophy and isocortical hypometabolism. The two biomarkers were related cross-sectionally (Spearman r=0.44), but the correlation between rate of change of the two biomarkers was low (Spearman r=0.10). We have previously detailed a number of concerns with operationalizing the NIA-AA model of preclinical AD 10 , 12 , but to date, those concerns are mainly quantitative (ie, selecting biomarkers and defining cutpoints) rather than conceptual. Nonetheless, our observations are consistent with predictions from our sequential model of AD pathophysiology 7 .
