# Title
The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale: Initial Validity
and Internal Consistency Findings From Three Multisite Studies With Adolescents
and Adults

# Abstract
Research on suicide prevention and interventions requires a standard
method for assessing both suicidal ideation and behavior to identify those
at risk and to track treatment response. The Columbia–Suicide
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was designed to quantify the severity of
suicidal ideation and behavior. The authors examined the psychometric
properties of the scale. The C-SSRS’s validity relative to other measures of suicidal
ideation and behavior and the internal consistency of its intensity of
ideation subscale were analyzed in three multisite studies: a treatment
study of adolescent suicide attempters (N=124); a medication
efficacy trial with depressed adolescents (N=312); and a study of
adults presenting to an emergency department for psychiatric reasons
(N=237). The C-SSRS demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity with
other multi-informant suicidal ideation and behavior scales and had high
sensitivity and specificity for suicidal behavior classifications compared
with another behavior scale and an independent suicide evaluation board.
Both the ideation and behavior subscales were sensitive to change over time.
The intensity of ideation subscale demonstrated moderate to strong internal
consistency. In the adolescent suicide attempters study, worst-point
lifetime suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS predicted suicide attempts during
the study, whereas the Scale for Suicide Ideation did not. Participants with
the two highest levels of ideation severity (intent or intent with plan) at
baseline had higher odds for attempting suicide during the study. These findings suggest that the C-SSRS is suitable for assessment of
suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical and research settings.

## Method
The studies used in the analyses are described below. More detailed
descriptions of the studies and the relevant scales are included in a data
supplement that accompanies the online edition of this article. Convergent validity,
divergent validity, sensitivity, specificity, sensitivity to change, predictive and
incremental validity, and internal consistency, as defined in Table 1 , were analyzed as shown in Table 2 . Rates of suicidal ideation at study entry and
lifetime actual suicide attempts for the three studies are presented in Figure 1 .

The Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters study was a National
Institute of Mental Health multisite feasibility study designed to develop
and evaluate treatments to prevent suicide reattempts in adolescents.
Participants were 124 male and female patients 12–18 years of age
with a suicide attempt or interrupted attempt during the 90 days before
enrollment ( 34 – 36 ). Participants were evaluated at
baseline and at treatment weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, as well as during
intervening unscheduled visits. Evaluations included the C-SSRS, the
Columbia Suicide History Form, the Scale for Suicide Ideation, and
Beck’s Lethality Scale. All instruments were administered by
independent evaluators, who were Ph.D.-, R.N.-, or master’s-level
clinicians. Assessment of participants also included the self-report Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) at the same visits, as well as ratings by the
treating psychopharmacologist (who was not the independent evaluator) on the
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Any potential
suicidal events in the study were rated by the suicide evaluation board,
which was an independent panel of suicidology experts uninvolved in the
day-to-day management of the trial. The board, which was blind to original
event classifications, treatment status, and other potentially biasing
information, rated narratives according to predetermined criteria and
definitions of potential suicidal events. Unanimous consensus was reached in
cases where there was any initial disagreement.

Most participants (N=96, 77.4%) were assessed at
week 12; 87 (70.2%) were evaluated at week 18, and 83
(66.9%) at week 24. Attrition between the study visits was due to
participants refusing to continue study treatment or assessments.
Participants who refused treatment but continued with assessments were
included in the analyses. There was one death by suicide in the study during
the follow-up period. As previously reported ( 36 ), participants who remained in the study for
longer than the median duration were similar to those who were followed for
less than the median duration on all baseline predictors of suicidal events
except income.

Study 2 was an industry-sponsored multisite, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose clinical trial to evaluate
the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram
relative to placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( 37 ). Participants were 312 adolescents
11–17 years of age with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
The study excluded patients who were considered a “suicide
risk” by the investigators, including those who had suicidal
ideation or had made a suicide attempt, although approximately 5.5%
reported some level of ideation at study entry ( Figure 1 ).

The self-report Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior (the
version for grades 7–9) ( 38 )
and the C-SSRS were administered by the study clinicians at initial
screening, at baseline, and at weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 (or on early
termination). Patients who completed at least one postbaseline assessment
were included in the present analysis (N=259). The characteristics
of the validation sample were similar to the baseline characteristics of the
total sample ( 37 ).

Study 3, funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,
evaluated the identification and classification of recent suicide attempts
and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior by emergency department providers at
three sites. Participants (N=237) were at least 18 years of age and
presented to an emergency department for psychiatric reasons. They were
categorized as having made a suicide attempt prior to the emergency
evaluation, having engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior in the
week prior to the evaluation, or reporting psychiatric symptoms without a
suicide attempt or nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior prior to the
evaluation. Study clinicians administered measures in the emergency
department, including the C-SSRS, the Scale for Suicide Ideation,
Beck’s Lethality Scale, and the Columbia Suicide History Form.

Analyses of data from studies 1 and 2 were conducted with SAS, version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Analyses of data from study 3 were conducted
with SPSS, version 19 (SPSS, Chicago).

In study 1, to examine the convergent and divergent validity of the
ideation and behavior components of the C-SSRS, associations between the
scale and other instruments measuring corresponding constructs were
initially tested using Pearson’s r. Effect sizes were computed
(Cohen’s d=2r/sqrt[1−r 2 ])
in order to compare the magnitude of the correlations. A mixed-effects
regression model was used to adjust for the effect of repeated assessments
over the course of the study. The C-SSRS ideation scores were entered as
dependent variables and the scores from corresponding scales as independent
variables. Unstructured covariance structure was specified.

The choice of random effects was based on the following assumption:
each participant has his or her own systematic baseline on the measures, and
each starting point is treated as the result of a random deviation from some
mean intercept. This model captures both the repeated-measures effect and
random-intercept effect in individuals when the correlation between measures
is assessed. Intercept and time (days in treatment) were included as
random-effect variables. A Steiger’s z test for comparison of
correlated correlations evaluated whether the severity and intensity
subscales were more related to the suicidal ideation item than items
measuring somatic features of depression on the MADRS and the BDI.

In study 2, the analysis was parallel to that in study 1 except that
the self-report Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior total score
was used as the criterion measure for the convergent validity of the
intensity subscale. The convergent and divergent validity of the C-SSRS
behavior subscale and the lethality subscales were not examined in study 2
because no other behavior measure was available for comparison.

In study 3, the convergent validity of the severity subscale,
intensity subscale, and behavior subscale was evaluated with the phi
coefficient.

Analysis of specificity in studies 1 and 3 examined the rate of true
negatives on the C-SSRS behavior subscale relative to behavior ratings on
the Columbia Suicide History Form and, in study 1, also to the suicide
evaluation board ratings. The rate of true positives relative to the ratings
on the Columbia Suicide History Form and the suicide evaluation board
ratings was used to show the sensitivity of the behavior subscale.

In studies 1 and 2, mixed-effects linear regression was used to test
sensitivity to change of the severity and behavior subscales over the study
period as measured by criterion scales. The C-SSRS scores were entered as
dependent variables, and the scores from the Scale for Suicide Ideation
(study 1) or the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior (study 2)
were entered as independent variables. Unstructured covariance structure was
specified, and intercept and time (days in treatment) were included as
random-effect variables.

In study 1, the predictive validity of the worst-point lifetime
ideation on the severity sub-scale for 1) actual attempts and 2) actual,
interrupted, and aborted attempts combined as reported on the Columbia
Suicide History Form between weeks 1 and 24 was examined using logistic
regression. Similarly, the predictive validity of the severity subscale was
tested for the actual attempts classified by the evaluation board. The
C-SSRS severity scores were entered as a continuous variable, and suicidal
behavior, including multiple attempts, as a dichotomous variable. The
average length of time between the baseline administration of the C-SSRS and
the week 24 Columbia Suicide History Form ratings was 134.63 days
(SD=65.48), as some subjects had their week 24 visit beyond 168
days. This variability was addressed in the model by including time as a
covariate.

Incremental validity was evaluated by comparing the predictive
validity of the lifetime worst-point ideation (including past week) on the
C-SSRS severity subscale to the predictive validity of 1) the total score
and 2) the suicidal intent items on the Scale for Suicide Ideation for the
same time period. Because intent to die appears to confer heightened risk
for suicide ( 14 , 15 , 39 ),
it was hypothesized a priori that presence of ideation with at least some
intent (the two most severe levels of ideation on the C-SSRS) would confer
greater risk than presence of ideation without intent. Logistic regression
was used to test whether a history of ideation with at least some intent in
contrast to levels of ideation on the C-SSRS without intent resulted in a
greater risk of suicide attempts or combined ratings of aborted,
interrupted, and actual attempts classified on the Columbia Suicide History
Form and actual attempts classified by the evaluation board.

The internal consistency of the C-SSRS ideation subscale in all
three studies was tested with Cronbach’s alpha. The severity and
behavior subscales use an ordinal scale and are therefore not subject to
internal consistency analysis. Other types of reliability (e.g., interrater)
could not be examined because of the design of the studies.

## Results
At baseline, the C-SSRS severity subscale and the Scale for Suicide
Ideation assessment of worst-point ideation both capture the most suicidal
period during the patient’s lifetime; at all subsequent assessments, the
since-last-visit and worst-point assessments both measure the most severe
suicidal ideation since the last assessment.

The C-SSRS severity subscale was moderately correlated with the
worst-point score on the Scale for Suicide Ideation (r=0.52, p<0.001;
effect size=1.22, N=472). The C-SSRS intensity subscale
containing the frequency, duration, controllability, certainty, and deterrents
items for the most severe ideation was moderately correlated with the
worst-point ideation total score on the Scale for Suicide Ideation
(r=0.56, p<0.001; effect size=1.36, N=487). For the
since-last-visit assessments, there was a strong relationship between the C-SSRS
severity subscale and the MADRS suicidal ideation item (r=0.63,
p<0.001; effect size=1.61) as well as the BDI suicide item, which
asks subjects to rate on a 4-point scale their thoughts of killing themselves
(r=0.80, p<0.001; effect size=2.66) ( Table 3 ). For the since-last-visit assessments,
there was also a strong relationship between the C-SSRS intensity subscale and
the MADRS suicidal ideation item (r=0.69, p<0.001; effect
size=1.93) as well as the BDI suicide item (r=0.51, p<0.001;
effect size=1.19).

In study 2, the convergent validity of the C-SSRS with the self-report
Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior total score over the course of
the study was moderate for the C-SSRS severity subscale (r=0.36,
p<0.01; effect size=0.77) and low for the C-SSRS intensity subscale
(r=0.23, p<0.001, effect size=0.47) based on pair
correlations at multiple time points across the study (total number of
pairs=234).

In study 3, the correlation between the C-SSRS severity subscale and the
Scale for Suicide Ideation total score was moderate (r=0.69, p<0.001,
N=211). The C-SSRS intensity subscale total score correlated modestly
with the Scale for Suicide Ideation total score (r=0.34, p<0.001;
N=193).

In study 1, the C-SSRS’s sensitivity and specificity of behavior
classifications relative to the behavior classifications on the Columbia Suicide
History Form and those by the evaluation board were examined. A total of 15
study subjects had at least one actual, interrupted, or aborted attempt. The
total number of these three behaviors in the study based on all visits was 24,
including unscheduled (emergency) visits. Relative to the Columbia Suicide
History Form, the C-SSRS had 99.4% specificity and 100%
sensitivity in correctly identifying aborted attempts and 100%
sensitivity and specificity for both interrupted and actual attempts ( Figure 2 ). Two aborted attempts were
identified by the behavior subscale that were not identified using the Columbia
Suicide History Form. The C-SSRS demonstrated 100% sensitivity and
96% specificity relative to the evaluation board ratings using the
combined classifications of actual and interrupted attempts. Five cases of
behavior were identified on the behavior subscale but not by the evaluation
board. Because the board did not classify aborted attempts (of which two were
identified by the C-SSRS), the total number of attempts analyzed here is 22, not
24.

In study 2, the convergent validity of behavior classifications was not
examined because no parallel measure of suicidal behavior was available.

In study 3, the degree of association regarding the identification of
lifetime (including past week) actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts using
the C-SSRS and the Columbia Suicide History Form was high (phi values, 0.99,
0.92, and 0.94, respectively; all p values <0.001; N=237). The C-SSRS
had 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in correctly
identifying lifetime actual attempts and 99% specificity and 94%
sensitivity in correctly identifying lifetime interrupted attempts that were
recorded on the Columbia Suicide History Form. Two lifetime interrupted attempts
were identified on the Columbia Suicide History Form that were not identified
using the C-SSRS. The scale had 99% specificity and 93%
sensitivity in correctly identifying lifetime aborted attempts that were
recorded on the Columbia Suicide History Form. Four lifetime aborted attempts
were identified on the Columbia Suicide History Form that were not identified
using the C-SSRS.

The actual lethality subscale was robustly correlated with the
Beck’s Lethality Scale score from the Columbia Suicide History Form
(r=0.79, p<0.001; N=237). The lethality subscale is rated on
a 6-point scale (running from 0 to 5) using general anchors for lethality,
whereas the Columbia Suicide History Form lethality subscale is rated on a
10-point scale (running from 0 to 9) using anchors that correspond to the method
of injury.

In study 1, the divergent validity of the C-SSRS severity subscale was
examined by correlating raw scores on the fatigue, sleep, appetite, and loss of
energy items on the self-report BDI and similar items on the MADRS, administered
by the psychopharmacologist, with the C-SSRS’s most severe ideation
since last visit, administered by a different clinician. Effect sizes using
Cohen’s d were computed to evaluate the strength of the significant
correlations. As in the analyses of convergent validity, mixed-effects
regression was used to adjust for the effect of multiple assessments over time
( Table 3 ).

For the since-last-visit assessments, weak or moderate correlations were
observed between the C-SSRS severity and intensity subscales and the BDI and
MADRS somatic depression items. A much stronger association with the BDI and
MADRS suicidal ideation items, in contrast to the weak relationship with
nonsuicidal items demonstrated by the Steiger’s z test for comparison of
correlated correlations, further supports the divergent validity of the C-SSRS
( Table 3 ). When adjusted for the
effect of multiple assessments, the findings were similar—for example, a
one-unit increase in the severity subscale score for the since-last-visit
assessments correlated (on average) with 0.278 units on the BDI sleep
disturbance item ( Table 3 ).

The relationship of the C-SSRS intensity subscale total score to somatic
symptoms of depression on the BDI and MADRS was also examined. As seen in Table 3 , correlations between the intensity
subscale and the BDI and MADRS items were generally small to moderate, in
contrast to larger correlations with the C-SSRS severity sub-scale. Effect sizes
for these associations varied from small to large. When adjusted for the effect
of repeated assessments, a one-unit change on the BDI and MADRS scores expressed
in standard deviation units corresponded to measurable changes in the intensity
subscale, indicated by the beta coefficients.

The divergent validity of the C-SSRS severity and intensity subscales in
studies 2 and 3 was not examined.

In study 1, results from the random-effects mixed linear regression that
tested sensitivity to change of the C-SSRS on the criterion scales over the
study period showed that the scale’s ideation and behavior ratings were
related to other measures over time. In the linear regression, a one-unit
decrease in the “total current” ideation score on the Scale for
Suicide Ideation corresponded to a decrease of 0.106 units in the C-SSRS
severity subscale score (p<0.001). Similarly, change in the Scale for Suicide
Ideation worst-point ideation corresponded to a significant change on the C-SSRS
intensity subscale for since-last-visit assessments (beta=0.071,
p<0.001). Figure 3 demonstrates that the
mean severity subscale scores and the mean intensity subscale scores responded
similarly to the change on the Scale for Suicide Ideation. All
unscheduled/emergency visits (N=39) occurring between baseline and week
24 were excluded from these analyses.

To assess the behavior subscale’s sensitivity to change, three
types of suicidal behaviors (aborted, interrupted, and actual attempts)
identified by the independent evaluators were plotted against those identified
by the Columbia Suicide History Form at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 ( Figure 2 ) and against interrupted, actual, and one
completed attempt combined, as classified by the evaluation board. There was
full agreement for interrupted and actual attempts and moderate agreement for
aborted attempts relative to the Columbia Suicide History Form classifications
(kappa=0.66, 95% confidence interval
[CI]=0.23–1.00) and high agreement
(kappa=0.88, 95% CI=0.77–0.98) with the attempt
and interrupted attempt classifications made by the evaluation board ( Figure 4 ). Only cases in which both the
C-SSRS and Columbia Suicide History Form ratings (N=364) from the same
assessments were available were included in the analysis. All
unscheduled/emergency visits occurring between baseline and week 24 were
excluded from the analysis. All potential events on the C-SSRS were later
classified by the evaluation board and included in the analyses. One suicide
rated by the board after the study was completed was not rated on the scale.

In study 2, linear regression showed that a one-unit decrease in total
score on the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior corresponded to an
average decrease of 0.31 units in the C-SSRS severity subscale score
(p=0.01) and to a decrease of 0.17 units in the intensity of ideation
scores (p<0.001).

The predictive validity of the C-SSRS was evaluated using the Columbia
Suicide History Form and the suicide evaluation board classifications; the
severity subscale was examined continuously and categorically (with or without
intent). The results were comparable with either approach.

In study 1, baseline C-SSRS ratings (based on worst-point lifetime
suicidal ideation and conducted before patients received any treatment)
significantly predicted suicide attempts during treatment (odds
ratio=1.45, 95% CI=1.07–1.98, p=0.02) as
well as actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts combined on the Columbia
Suicide History Form between week 1 and week 24 (odds ratio=1.34,
95% CI=1.05–1.70, p=0.02) and classifications
made by the suicide evaluation board. In the parallel analyses predicting the
behavior classifications made by the suicide evaluation board from the baseline
severity of ideation ratings, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the
lifetime (including past week) severity of ideation on the C-SSRS, the odds of
actual attempts increased by 43% (odds ratio=1.43, 95%
CI=0.99–2.05, p=0.05). Analyses included all 124
participants who were assessed at baseline, using intent-to-treat model.

For every one-standard-deviation increase in the level of lifetime
suicidal ideation reported at study entry, the odds of attempting suicide during
the study increased by 45%. The odds of actual, interrupted, or aborted
suicide attempts combined as assessed by the Columbia Suicide History Form
increased by 34% for every one-standard-deviation increase in lifetime
severity of ideation score. Predictive validity was also evaluated using a
lifetime history of the most severe ideation with and without intent on the
C-SSRS severity subscale. The odds of suicide attempts scored on the Columbia
Suicide History Form during follow-up were compared in participants who endorsed
a lifetime history of the two most severe levels of ideation (where at least
some intent to die was present) reported at baseline and those who endorsed a
history of less severe ideation (types 0–3) (odds ratio=3.26,
95% CI=1.02–10.45, p=0.047). The lifetime
history of the two highest severity levels of ideation reported on the C-SSRS at
baseline were also associated with higher odds of actual, interrupted, and
aborted attempts combined on the Columbia Suicide History Form (odds
ratio=2.76, 95% CI=1.07–7.12, p=0.036).
In the parallel analyses, predicting from the dichotomously scored lifetime
severity of ideation to the behavior classifications by the evaluation board,
the odds of actual attempts were almost four times higher for those with a
lifetime history (including past week) of the two most severe levels of ideation
at baseline (odds ratio=3.85, 95% CI=1.07–13.86,
p=0.039).

We conducted similar analyses of predictive validity with the total
score (lifetime) and with the intent items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. No
significant results were observed for any of the outcomes. A
one-standard-deviation increase in the total score (lifetime) was not associated
with an increase in odds of suicide attempts on the Columbia Suicide History
Form (odds ratio=1.02, 95% CI=0.95–1.11,
p=0.57) or in odds of actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts combined
on the Columbia Suicide History Form at follow-up (odds ratio=1.01,
95% CI=0.95–1.07, p=0.79).

In the categorical analysis based on the intent items (a score
≥1 on item 4 or 5) from the Scale for Suicide Ideation, the odds of
attempts during the study were not higher for actual attempts (odds
ratio=1.44, p=0.76; all of the attempters endorsed intent) or
for the combined ratings of actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts (odds
ratio=2.19, p=0.49; all of the attempters endorsed intent).

Because baseline Scale for Suicide Ideation scores (either total score
or score on the intent items) were not significantly associated with attempts
during the study, the incremental predictive validity of the C-SSRS severity
sub-scale relative to the Scale for Suicide Ideation could not be estimated.

In study 1, the C-SSRS intensity subscale was examined at two assessment
intervals: since last visit and past week. The internal consistency of the
intensity subscale was high, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.937 for since
last visit and 0.946 for the past week. In studies 2 and 3, the internal
consistency of the intensity subscale across all visits was moderate, with a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.73.

## Discussion
We examined the psychometric properties of the C-SSRS and demonstrated
convergent, divergent, and predictive validity; sensitivity to change; sensitivity
and specificity of the instrument; and internal consistency of the intensity
subscale. The study design precluded examination of other indices of reliability,
although interrater reliability has already been demonstrated ( 31 , 32 , 36 ). In all three studies analyzed, the C-SSRS
ideation and behavior sub-scales showed strong convergent validity with established
ideation and behavior scales. The finding of only a moderate convergent relationship
between the C-SSRS severity and intensity of ideation scores and the Scale for
Suicide Ideation total score, as well as the Suicidal Ideation
Questionnaire–Junior score, was expected and was likely due to nonoverlap in
items and different construct operationalization. The C-SSRS demonstrated strong
divergent validity with items on the BDI and the MADRS that were not expected to
overlap with suicidal ideation and behavior (e.g., somatic depression symptoms such
as fatigue). Because suicide risk and protective factors are not orthogonal to
psychiatric diagnosis ( 40 ), establishing
divergent validity with measures of other constructs is essential. In suicidal
adolescents, ideation was most closely related to suicide-related items in other
measures, in contrast to other types of symptoms of psychiatric disorders or
physical illnesses.

Several other findings have important implications. In study 1, a decrease
in the severity of ideation from “active suicidal thoughts” to
“wish to die” or “no ideation” was accompanied by
corresponding decreases in Scale for Suicide Ideation score, suggesting that the
C-SSRS severity subscale is sensitive to clinical change. Similarly, the C-SSRS
identified almost an identical number of cases with specific types of suicidal
behavior compared to the Columbia Suicide History Form and the suicide evaluation
board ratings, and this agreement held over the course of the study. There was a
high degree of agreement in the classification of suicidal behavior between the
Columbia Suicide History Form, the evaluation board ratings, and the C-SSRS. The
behavior subscale demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity relative to behavior
classifications on the Columbia Suicide History Form and by the evaluation
board.

A striking finding in this study was that the C-SSRS demonstrated predictive
validity but the Scale for Suicide Ideation did not. The Scale for Suicide Ideation
has shown predictive validity for death by suicide with adults in other long-term
follow-up studies ( 41 , 42 ), but it did not predict near-term nonfatal suicidal
behavior in this study. As with any cross-study comparison, differences in
predictive validity may result from differences in clinical populations, assessment
context, and time. Another plausible explanation for this divergent finding is
scoring differences between the two scales. The Scale for Suicide Ideation total
score aggregates many characteristics of suicidal ideation along a continuum,
whereas the C-SSRS identifies types of ideation and classifies individuals as having
intent, as well as having intent and a plan. Factor structure analyses of the Scale
for Suicide Ideation have shown that certain clusters of items assessing
“plans” and “desire” show differential prediction of
past attempts and eventual suicide ( 21 , 43 ). The present study raises the question of
whether identifying specific types of suicidal ideation may be more useful for
prospective research and for risk stratification. Further prospective studies of
suicide risk using standardized measures are warranted.

Of particular interest are the results from study 1 suggesting that a
history of severe ideation with at least some intent to die may confer a greater
risk for suicidal behavior than a history of ideation with no intent to die.
Establishing clinically meaningful thresholds that indicate heightened suicide risk
and predict which individuals will go on to engage in suicidal behavior have been
elusive in efforts at suicide prevention ( 3 ).
Because ideation severity can be used to set criteria for clinical referral and
inclusion or exclusion criteria in research, operationalization of clinical
thresholds could facilitate enrollment of patients with suicidal behavior in
research studies, as well as clinical management more broadly.

As with any instrument, one must be mindful of the population one is working
with. Depending on the population, 25% to 60% of attempts are
considered “impulsive” ( 44 – 46 ), but the role of
impulsivity in suicide is far from clear ( 41 , 42 ), and “impulsive”
attempts may include prior ideation and planning ( 41 ). The results should be replicated in studies designed to test
psychometric properties of the scale, and the application of the scale in different
populations deserves further study, particularly in light of the different potential
routes to suicidal behavior (e.g., which severity items predict which behaviors, and
what other factors, such as substance abuse or family history, modify the risk
associated with the severity or intensity of ideation).

There are several significant limitations to this analysis. The studies
on which our analyses are based were not prospectively designed to examine
psychometric properties of the instruments, although the replication of findings
across three different studies is reassuring. The significant associations
between the C-SSRS and the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the Columbia Suicide
History Form may be attributed in part to the fact that the same interviewers
contemporaneously administered the scales; while this may be an advantage in
demonstrating convergent validity, it also increases the risk of interviewer or
rater bias. To address this issue, self-report measures (the BDI and the
Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire–Junior), ratings (on the MADRS) by a
study psychopharmacologist who was not administering the C-SSRS, and ratings by
the independent suicide evaluation board were analyzed, and the results were
similar. Nevertheless, further examination of concurrent and incremental
validity and interrater reliability of this scale with other measures of
suicidal ideation and behavior is warranted.

The incidence of aborted, interrupted, and actual attempts was very low
in the two prospective studies (studies 1 and 2), which limits the precision of
the sensitivity and specificity estimates. The generalizability of the
predictive validity findings is limited in study 1 because only adolescent
attempters were included in the sample (thus, predictive validity for that study
refers to prediction of re-attempt). Although there are advantages to using
diverse populations in these analyses, there may be limitations to the
generalizability of results. While study 1 included only adolescent attempters,
study 2 excluded individuals with current ideation or a history of suicide
attempt, and study 3 was a clinical sample of adults presenting to an emergency
department for psychiatric treatment. These findings must be replicated with
community samples.

## Conclusions
These analyses of the C-SSRS using data from three studies provide initial
promising data on the convergent and divergent validity, predictive validity,
sensitivity, specificity, sensitivity to change, and internal consistency of the
C-SSRS. Greater precision in the assessment of suicidal behavior and ideation is
necessary for improving identification and clinical management, as well as for
research-derived risk-benefit analyses. The use of a standardized measure such as
the C-SSRS that comprehensively assesses suicidal behavior and ideation permits
comparison of findings across research and clinical populations, as well as trends
over time, providing data to guide treatment recommendations for suicidal patients
and suicide prevention efforts.
