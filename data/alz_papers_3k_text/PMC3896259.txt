Meta-analysis of 74,046 individuals identifies 11 new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) were identified by previous studies; however, a large portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained. We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2,11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 11,312 controls. In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E), 19 loci reached genome-wide significance ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly associated with Alzheimer’s disease.

## ONLINE METHODS
All case-control studies are described in Table 1 , in the Supplementary Note (see full description of the I-GAP data sets) and in Supplementary Tables 1, 7 and 8 . Written informed consent was obtained from study participants or, for those with substantial cognitive impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian or other proxy, and the study protocols for all populations were reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.

After quality control criteria were finalized for each individual and each sample collection (SNPs with call rates of <95% were excluded; Supplementary Note ), IMPUTE2 (ref. 42) or MaCH/Minimac 43 software ( Supplementary Table 2 ) was used to impute the genotypes of all participants with haplotypes derived from samples of European ancestry in the 1000 Genome Project (2010 interim release based on the sequence data freeze from 4 August 2010 and phased haplotypes from December 2010). In each data set, SNPs with R 2 or info score quality estimates of less than 0.3, as indicated by MaCH or IMPUTE2, respectively (with these two quality estimates described to be equivalent), were excluded from analyses. Similarly, SNPs with a MAF of <1% were also excluded. After these procedures, a maximum of 8,133,148 SNPs were retained that were present in at least 1 data set.

In each case-control data set, the association of LOAD with genotype dosage was analyzed by a logistic regression model including covariates for age, sex and principal components to adjust for possible population stratification ( Supplementary Table 2 ). For the three CHARGE cohorts with incident Alzheimer’s disease data, Cox proportional hazards models were used. The four consortia used different but analogous software for these analyses (PLINK 44 , SNPTEST 45 , ProbABEL 46 or R; Supplementary Table 2 ). Three of these tools were applied to the EADI data set for quality control, and very similar results were observed. After the exclusion of SNPs showing logistic regression coefficient |β| > 5 or P value equal to 0 or 1, the maximum number of SNPs in any data set was 8,131,643. Each consortium uploaded summarized results for each SNP to an internal I-GAP website for access by members of each consortium.

SNPs genotyped or imputed in at least 40% of Alzheimer’s disease cases and 40% of control samples were included in the meta-analysis. This threshold represented the best compromise between maximizing the total number of SNPs and maximizing the number of samples in which the given SNP was present. Indeed, analyzing all SNPs available in at least one study could have greatly increased the risk of false positives. On the other hand, studying SNPs only present in all studies could have led to the removal of SNPs of potential interest, even if those SNPs could have reached adequate statistical power in a more limited number of data sets (false negatives). This approach allowed us to increase homogeneity between studies for some SNPs by excluding poor quality data present only in a limited number of data sets of small size. This last selection step led to a final number of 7,055,881 SNPs in stage 1 analysis.

SNPs associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk and exhibiting P value < 1 × 10 −3 in stage 1 analysis were selected for replication. A list of 19,532 SNPs was submitted to a devoted Illumina website to develop an iSelect microarray. A total of 16,732 SNPs exhibiting an Illumina score superior or equal to 0.4 were selected for microarray production. During the Illumina production process, 2,287 SNPs failed oligonucleotide synthesis, leading to a final number of 14,445 SNPs for which genotyping was attempted. Genotyping failure led to the further exclusion of an additional 1,999 SNPs as a result of the SNPs (i) having no intensity signal ( n = 559), (ii) not being polymorphic ( n = 1,176), (iii) only being found in a heterozygous state ( n = 248) or (iv) having mismatched alleles compared to 1000 Genomes Project data ( n = 16). Finally, several quality control measures were applied to the remaining 12,446 SNPs to detect potential biases in genotyping. We first tested for discrepancies in allelic frequency between the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel and stage 2 data. Allele frequencies for stage 2 data were estimated on 10,750 controls (see “Stage 2 sample quality control”) and after exclusion of Finnish individuals. The allelic test was performed with PLINK, and P values were computed by performing 4,500,000 permutations to avoid an assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In total, 798 SNPs showed a highly significant difference in terms of allele frequency between the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel and stage 2 data ( P < 1 × 10 −5 ; Supplementary Fig. 18 ) and were excluded from the analysis.

Other SNP quality control steps were performed separately in data for each country. A SNP was considered of low genotyping quality in a country data set if it had missing genotype data for more than 10% of the individuals, if the P value for the Hardy-Weinberg test in controls was lower than 1 × 10 −6 or if the P value for the test for differences in missingness between cases and controls was lower than 1 × 10 −6 (see Supplementary Table 9 for differences in missingness assessed for suggestive and significant hits across European populations). These quality control steps led to the removal of 16 SNPs with low genotyping quality in data from all countries.

After SNP quality control, 11,632 SNPs were considered to be of high genotyping quality in at least 1 country and were analyzed in stage 2. For imputed data sets, SNPs were considered to be of low imputation quality if their info score was <0.3.

Of note, of the 7,086 SNPs that we were unable to successfully genotype, only 471 were not tagged by another successfully genotyped variant (±100 kb) and associated with a P value at least 10 times higher than that of the missing SNP. Because the vast majority of the untagged SNPs exhibited stage 1 P values between 1 × 10 −3 and 1 × 10 −4 (92%), the likelihood of missing a true association was considered to be low.

The iSelect microarray contained 33,368 SNPs, of which 11,632 were devoted to stage 2. These supplementary SNPs included various genetic data that allowed us to further refine our quality control processes. On the basis of data for all of these SNPs, we excluded individuals who had more than 3% missing genotypes, showed a discrepancy between reported sex and sex estimated on the basis of genetic data (genetic sex) or showed evidence of non-European ancestry. Duplicated and related individuals were identified ( Supplementary Table 10 ). Briefly, discrepancies in sex were examined using genetic sex as estimated by PLINK on 40 SNPs on chromosome X. We also removed 93 individuals from a single plate for whom an abnormal number of discrepancies in sex were observed, suggesting that sample mixing had occurred. Using a panel of 261 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs), we performed a principal-component analysis (PCA) on HapMap 2 data with the function SMARTPCA from EIGENSOFT 4.2 software 47 . For each country, individuals were projected onto the first two PCA axes to define their genetic ancestry. Individuals with evidence of non-European ancestry were then identified by applying a Bayesian clustering approach 48 to their coordinates on the first two axes. Identity by descent (IBD) was computed for all pairs of individuals using PLINK, and individuals in a pair with IBD greater than 0.98 were considered to be duplicates. If clinical data for duplicated individuals were discordant, both individuals were excluded. Otherwise, the individual with the greater proportion of missing genotype was excluded. Similarly, IBD was computed for all pairs of individuals in data from each country separately, using 6,764 autosomal SNPs with MAF of >1% and selected to minimize LD. Individuals in pairs with IBD greater than 0.2 were considered to be related and were iteratively removed so as to obtain a sample of unrelated individuals within each country data set.

Finally, individuals with missing clinical data and controls less than 25 years of age were excluded from the analysis. After sample quality control ( Supplementary Table 10 ), 19,884 individuals (8,572 cases and 11,312 controls) were available for analysis in stage 2.

For the stage 1 meta-analysis, we undertook fixed-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis with the standard errors of the β-coefficient scaled by the square roots of study-specific genomic inflation factors estimated before combining the summary statistics across data sets. Each consortium performed an independent stage 1 meta-analysis after downloading the data files available on the I-GAP website. Two software packages were used for meta-analysis: METAL 49 and GWAMA 50 . Very similar results were generated independently of the software used and as expected, perfect matching was observed between the analyses undertaken by each of the 4 consortia.

For stage 2, association tests were performed for each country for all high-quality genotyped SNPs under an additive model, using logistic regression as implemented in PLINK. Analysis was adjusted for age, sex and principal components, when necessary. Using SMARTPCA, PCA was performed on individuals from each country separately. Difference in PCA coordinates between cases and controls were tested for the first four principal components, and analysis was further adjusted on principal components if the P value of this test was lower than 0.05. PCA for Bonn stage 2 samples was based on GWAS data. For imputed data sets, association tests were performed using likelihood score tests for missing data as implemented in SNPTEST. Genotyped and imputed German samples were analyzed separately, and results were then combined by fixed-effects meta-analysis using the inverse variance approach as implemented in METAL. Using this approach, a fixed-effects meta-analysis was then performed to combine stage 2 results from the different countries. We also performed the analysis separately for each center in stage 2 and combined the results by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Results were similar to those obtained when analysis was performed by country (data not shown).

We finally generated fixed-effects inverse variance–weighted meta-analyses by combining summary statistics across ADGC, CHARGE, EADI, GERAD and stage 2 data by country. At this point, we performed Cochran’s Q test for heterogeneity and generated I 2 estimates with METAL to evaluate the possible effect of study heterogeneity on the results.

A graphic representation of the association signal in the stage 1 data was generated with LocusZoom software 51 for all the loci of interest reaching a genome-wide significant level after combined stage 1 and stage 2 analyses.

PAF was calculated using the Levin equation 52 .

To gain further biological insights, we explored reported associations between SNPs in the top I-GAP loci and gene expression. We first selected all SNPs that reached genome-wide significance ( P value ≤ 5 × 10 −8 ) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis and were located in a 500-kb window upstream or downstream of the top SNP at each locus ( Table 2 ). We then searched for published data on gene expression associated with each of these SNPs in the eQTL database from the Pritchard laboratory (see URLs). For each reported eQTL gene and each type of eQTL association as defined in this database, we then counted the number of reported eQTL SNPs and selected the one with the lowest P value.
