# Title
Direct Observation of Heterogeneous Amyloid Fibril
Growth Kinetics via Two-Color Super-Resolution Microscopy

# Abstract
 The
self-assembly of normally soluble proteins into fibrillar amyloid
structures is associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders,
such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. In the
present study, we show that specific events in the kinetics of the
complex, multistep aggregation process of one such protein, α-synuclein,
whose aggregation is a characteristic hallmark of Parkinson’s
disease, can be followed at the molecular level using optical super-resolution
microscopy. We have explored in particular the elongation of preformed α-synuclein
fibrils; using two-color single-molecule localization microscopy we
are able to provide conclusive evidence that the elongation proceeds
from both ends of the fibril seeds. Furthermore, the technique reveals
a large heterogeneity in the growth rates of individual fibrils; some
fibrils exhibit no detectable growth, whereas others extend to more
than ten times their original length within hours. These large variations
in the growth kinetics can be attributed to fibril structural polymorphism.
Our technique offers new capabilities in the study of amyloid growth
dynamics at the molecular level and is readily translated to the study
of the self-assembly of other nanostructures.

## Amyloid Growth from Seed Fibrils Is a Bidirectional
Process
In order to visualize α-synuclein fibrils using d STORM, we prepared separate batches of covalently labeled
cysteine
variants (N122C) of the protein with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) and with
Alexa Fluor 568 (AF568) dyes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) (see
Materials and Methods in Supporting Information ). We verified that the dye labels do not interfere with the aggregation
process and that the fibril morphology and the kinetics of fibril
formation are indistinguishable from those of the unlabeled protein,
as revealed by AFM and ThT assays (see Supporting
Information ). We chose to use direct covalent labeling of α-synuclein
rather than immunofluorescence staining because of the very small
size of the Alexa dye labels compared to antibody molecules, and because
of the high specificity of labeling afforded by use of covalent linkages,
both of which result in an increase in the resolution of the imaging
process. 25 , 26 We found the optimal labeling ratio for
two-color d STORM to be ca. 1:20 for the fraction
of labeled relative to unlabeled protein; too high a labeling density
would compromise resolution (by increasing the likelihood that proximate
fluorophores emit simultaneously and therefore cause mislocalization)
and might potentially lead to steric interferences of the dye with
the amyloid protein. Figure 1 a,c show the conventional,
diffraction limited fluorescence images of α-synuclein fibrils;
the corresponding d STORM images are shown in Figure 1 b,d. From the d STORM images, we
inferred an average fibril diameter of 18 ± 2 nm, which shows
that the resolution achieved approaches that of techniques such as
AFM. 29

and super-resolution images

(diffraction limited) fluorescence images of the fibrils, labeled
with AF647 and AF568, respectively; (b,d) corresponding d STORM images, demonstrating the dramatic resolution enhancement obtainable
over conventional imaging.

Having established that α-synuclein fibrils can be
reliably
imaged using our super-resolution technique, we proceeded to perform
two-color d STORM experiments and to analyze the dynamics
of fibril growth. We visualized the process of fibril elongation using
a seeded aggregation assay; 30 , 31 the starting point
was a solution of preformed fibrils of α-synuclein with an average
length of 400 nm, labeled at 5% with AF568 (green) (see Materials
and Methods in Supporting Information for
details). At the start of each such assay, a solution containing α-synuclein
in its monomeric state with 5% of the protein molecules labeled with
AF647 (red) was added to the initial sample at a 10-fold excess (by
mass); under these conditions the only relevant molecular process
is elongation, 31 , 32 permitting the direct measurement
of the rates of this specific process. The solution was left to incubate
for 24 h at 37 °C and under quiescent conditions in which breakage
of fibrils is minimal. At different time points during the aggregation
reaction aliquots were taken from the solution and deposited onto
glass coverslip chambers containing photoswitching buffer, optimized
for two-color d STORM (see Materials and Methods in Supporting Information ). The fibrils had therefore
been allowed to elongate in bulk solution in the absence of any sample-substrate
interactions that might have affected the growth kinetics. 11 , 13 Figure 2 shows the elongation of the seed
fibrils as a function of time. In Figure 2 a,
the seed fibrils, labeled with green AF568, are shown before addition
of the monomeric protein. At the beginning of the experiment ( t = 0 h) monomeric protein labeled with red AF647 was added
and two-color super-resolution images were recorded at different time
points during 24 h of fibril growth, as shown in Figure 2 b–h.

Using two-color d STORM
we are able to distinguish
between the seed fibrils initially present (indicated by arrowheads
and rendered in green color) and the freshly added protein (indicated
by arrows and rendered in red color). We can therefore monitor the
process of fibril elongation over hours or even days in the absence
of any destructive sample preparation steps such as drying or shaking,
which are known to induce breakage. Indeed, fibril breakage was observed
to be negligible in our experiments, as all fibrils we had imaged
contained either elements of both green fluorescence (AF568 from the
seed species) and red fluorescence (AF647, signifying the newly added
protein), or just green fluorescence (AF568, the latter also indicating
that no detectable growth had taken place); no fibrils were observed
that were solely labeled with red fluorophores, indicating that neither
monomer nucleation, nor fibril breakage were significant under the
experimental conditions reported here. In contrast to conventional
TIRF fluorescence imaging (Figure 2 i), two-color d STORM (Figure 2 h) clearly distinguishes
between the original fibril seeds and the grown regions of the fibrils.
Importantly, our data establish unambiguously that α-synuclein
fibril elongation under the conditions used here is a bidirectional
process, that is, that it proceeds from both ends of fibril seeds.
In previous experiments, both bidirectional 10 , 12 , 13 and unidirectional 6 , 7 , 9 growth of different amyloid fibrils such
as Aβ, amylin, and α-synuclein have been reported, although
issues such as substrate interference with fibril growth could not
be excluded, or the resolution from conventional techniques was limited.
Here, the elongation reaction occurs in an undisturbed environment
in bulk solution, and hence is unaffected by such interference. Furthermore,
the resolution achieved with two-color d STORM enables
to conclusively establish that fibril growth is bidirectional.

We performed additional control experiments using solutions containing
either seed fibrils in the absence of monomeric protein, or solutions
containing monomeric protein in the absence of seed fibrils. Incubation
of these samples for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in no observable
fibril elongation or fibril formation (see Supporting
Information Figure 3). These results confirm that seed fibrils
are inert in the absence of monomeric protein and therefore do not,
for example, join together by mutual interaction of their free ends.
Also, de novo formation of α-synuclein amyloid
fibrils via primary nucleation occurs at a negligible rate relative
to fibril growth, confirming elongation of seeds as the only significant
process during the aggregation reactions presented here.

## Analysis of Fibril
Elongation Kinetics Reveals Inhomogeneous
Growth Rates and Distinct Fibril Populations
In order to
investigate possible variations in growth kinetics for individual
fibrils, we analyzed multiple d STORM images of growing
fibrils, recorded at different time points during the aggregation
reaction and in different regions of the glass coverslips (see Materials
and Methods in Supporting Information for
details); we then studied the distribution of elongation values as
a function of time. In Figure 3 a, histograms
of the measured elongation lengths of individual fibrils are shown
( d STORM, red channel) for different time points up
to 24 h of the aggregation reaction. The width of the observed distributions
of fibril elongation values can be seen to increase significantly
with time; for example, after t = 24 h, some fibrils
have reached lengths of up to 7 μm, but others show either no,
or only a very small, increase in length. In Figure 3 b, we have plotted the histograms of the corresponding average
growth “velocities” (calculated as the length increase
divided by the overall growth time) at the same time points as depicted
in Figure 3 a. These histograms show that the
variation in elongation rates remains approximately constant over
time, indicating that at each time point there is a range of fibrils
displaying distinct growth rates.

We further investigated the
two extreme elongation values; namely the frequency of the occurrence
of seeds that show no detectable growth (denoted by the absence of
any red regions that would indicate that fibril elongation had taken
place) or that of species exhibiting very fast growth rates. The most
striking feature of the data presented in Figure 3 c is that a significant proportion of seed fibrils (17%) did
not exhibit any growth in the presence of monomeric protein and remained
at their initial length. 100 In contrast,
the majority of the fibrils (63%) grew up to 10 times their initial
length in 24 h; indeed, a small fraction of fibrils (20%) grew more
than 10 times their initial length. Taking the average of all individual
rates observed, including data from fibrils that had not elongated,
we obtained a mean growth rate of 1.4 nm/min over 24 h, with a standard
deviation of 1 nm/min, which is in good agreement with the values
for average growth rates obtained using ThT ensemble measurements. 31 Clearly, the observed ensemble kinetics are
a consequence of a larger number of elementary reaction steps that
cannot be resolved in ensemble measurements in which it is assumed
that the growth of all fibrils contributes equally to the observed
total increase in fibril mass. Of particular interest is the finding
that some seed fibrils remain inactive throughout the entire duration
of the experiment (24 h) that suggests that individual seeds can have
very different elongation capacities.

Two-color d STORM images
reveal details of the
elongation of α-synuclein fibrils through addition of soluble
protein molecules, in vitro . (a) The initial sample
consists of α-synuclein seed fibrils at 8 μM concentration,
labeled with AF568 (green). At t = 0 h, monomeric
α-synuclein at a total concentration of 80 μM (76 μM
wild type, 4 μM AF647-labeled N122C) (red) was added to the
solution. (b–h) Aliquots were taken during the aggregation
reaction and imaged with two-color d STORM. The images
show the overlay of the two channels (green, AF568 and red, AF647).
The time points after the initiation of aggregation are (b) t = 1 h, (c) t = 2 h, (d) t = 3 h, (e) t = 5 h, (f) t = 6
h, and (g,h) t = 24 h. Each fibril consists of the
initial seed (green, indicated by an arrowhead) and the extended region
formed through addition of monomeric protein (red, indicated by an
arrow). The lengths of the fibrils reach several micrometers with
the initial seed fibril being extended from both ends. (h) Two-color d STORM image of a fibril at t = 24 h and
(i) conventional fluorescence image in TIRF of the same fibril as
in (h), showing that the increase in resolution achieved by d STORM enables the original and the newly formed section
of the fibril to be clearly distinguished.

## The Mechanism of α-Synuclein Fibril Elongation Deviates
from a Purely Stochastic Process Involving Random Growth
To gain insights into possible molecular mechanisms underlying the
observed variations in elongation rates we carried out a more detailed
analysis of rate distributions and studied the results in the context
of different models of fibril elongation. For a random (stochastic)
process involving discrete events, such as the addition of monomeric
protein molecules to fibril ends, the probability of a certain number
of these events occurring in a given time is governed by Poisson statistics.
In each histogram of Figure 3 a, we have therefore
overlaid curves depicting the corresponding Poisson distributions
for the number of attached monomers, based on the averages of the
elongation values obtained from the histograms and assuming that addition
of a single monomer of α-synuclein leads to a fibril length
increase of 0.5 nm. 31 The data indicate
that the measured distributions are not at all represented by Poisson
distributions and that much larger variations in elongation rates
are observed than predicted by this analysis, again indicating rapid
growth of certain fibrils whereas others exhibit imperceptible growth,
as schematically depicted in Figure 4 .

A different model to account for inhomogenous growth kinetics invokes
the so-called “stop-and-go” mechanism, which has been
discussed for amyloid fibrils of Aβ 25–35 14 and glucagon. 16 In
these studies, it was proposed that the origin of the observed switching
between active (“go”) and inactive (“stop”)
states lies in the occasional incorrect addition of a monomer onto
a fibril end, such that the templating effect is lost until this monomer
detaches or rearranges into the correctly folded state. 33 The consistency of this hypothesis with the
reported in these studies data can, however, be probed by a simple
argument; the free energy barrier for the dissociation of a correctly
incorporated monomer from a fibril end must represent an upper bound
for the energy barrier of dissociation, or for the rearrangement of
improperly attached monomers, given that the correctly incorporated
monomer is likely to represent the minimum in the free energy landscape. 34 The data presented in ref ( 14 ) allowed the elongation
rate constants during the growth phases, k + , to be determined as ∼10 6 M –1 s –1 and the critical concentration, c crit to be ∼10 μM. At equilibrium, the fluxes
of growth and dissociation are equal, and therefore the equilibrium
constant is K = 1/ c crit = k + / k off , where k off is the rate constant of
dissociation. From this analysis we estimate k off ≈ 10 s –1 , which represents a rate
more than 2 orders of magnitude faster than that of switching between
the growth-incompetent and the growth-competent states reported in
ref ( 14 ) (∼0.03
s –1 ). It therefore seems likely that additional
factors determine the duration of the inactive periods in the experiments
reported; one possibility is interactions with the surfaces on which
the fibrils grow. In the present study, the seed fibrils grow in solution
and are only deposited onto a surface for imaging, therefore minimizing
such additional interactions.

that each monomer has a length of 0.5 nm. (b) Histograms showing the

568 and the red spheres correspond to the monomeric protein labeled
with Alexa Fluor 647. k e denotes the average
elongation rate constant.

We next explored whether or not the heterogeneous growth
kinetics
for individual fibrils observed in our experiments are compatible
with a “stop-and-go” model. Looking at the histograms
in Figure 3 it is apparent that some fibrils
have inactive periods of several hours. Assuming that a fibril will
become active again when an incorrectly folded monomer becomes detached
at its end we can estimate using similar arguments as above whether
this time scale is compatible with such a hypothesis: using a critical
concentration of α-synuclein of ∼2 μM, 34 and the determined average growth rate of k + ≈ 10 3 ± 375 M –1 s –1 (this work and ref ( 31 )) we obtain an estimate for the lower bound for
the average dissociation rate, k off ≈
(2.0 ± 0.8) × 10 –3 s –1 . Although this value may deviate from that for individual fibrils,
it cannot account for the observation that some fibrils are inactive
for the entire duration of the experiment, that is, for at least 24
h. Additionally, since this process should affect fibrils of all lengths
equally, it is unlikely to provide an explanation of the observed
heterogeneity in fibril elongation rates. Therefore we suggest the
following alternative explanations:

(1) Certain amyloid templates/seeds
are not efficient in recruiting
monomeric protein, leading to different fibril morphologies and growth
rates (fibril polymorphism). 35 This mechanism
has been proposed for several proteins such as the yeast prion Sup35, 36 − 38 glucagon, 39 Aβ, 40 − 44 tau, 45 and α-synuclein. 46 , 47

(2) The spatial arrangement of fibrils, for example, because
of
assembly into higher order structures 31 or variations in protofilament organization, 41 may block the access needed for monomers to attach to fibril
ends. Additionally, the ends of seed fibrils may become damaged during
production, although this is unlikely here, because neither sample
drying nor harsh fragmentation methods, such as sonication, were used.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the development and application
of two-color d STORM as a powerful tool for the visualization
of α-synuclein fibril growth from seed templates and have carried
out a quantitative analysis of the kinetics of this process. With
this technique, we are able to distinguish de novo growth of fibrils from the original seed and to follow elongation
at nanometer resolution. Our method proves conclusively that α-synuclein
fibril elongation, under the conditions used here, is a bidirectional
process. In addition, no end-to-end association of seed fibrils was
observed to occur and elongation of seeds was evident only in the
presence of monomeric protein. The kinetics of fibril growth are not
adequately described by a single elongation rate parameter; rather,
a large variation in growth rates was found to exist. The observed
process is neither consistent with a “stop-and-go” type
mechanism in which misfolded species at the fibril end need to be
removed before growth can resume, nor with the notion that monomer
addition is a diffusion controlled, stochastic process, for which
variations in growth rates would be much smaller. We therefore suggest
two alternative mechanisms that can be explored in future studies.
Furthermore, the methodology described here can be readily extended
to in situ applications in biological samples, for
example, to monitor aggregation within cells and to elucidate the
various parameters that affect fibril growth. It could also be used
to identify different fibril strains, which may arise in vivo , and to investigate their role in the production and spreading of
amyloidogenic species in disease.
