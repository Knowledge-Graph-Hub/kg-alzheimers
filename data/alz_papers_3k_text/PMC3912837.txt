# Title
Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia that
overlaps with bipolar disorder

# Abstract
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with a lifetime risk of
about 1%, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and cognitive
deficits with heritability estimated at up to 80% 1 , 2 . We adopted two analytic approaches to determine the
extent to which common genetic variation underlies risk of SCZ using genome-wide
association study (GWAS) data from 3,322 European individuals with SCZ and 3,587
controls. First, we implicate the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
Second, we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic
component to risk of SCZ involving thousands of common alleles of very small
effect. We show that this component also contributes to risk of bipolar disorder
(BPD), but not to multiple non-psychiatric diseases.

## METHODS SUMMARY
Cases satisfied criteria for SCZ. Clinical characteristics and copy number
variation have been described previously 15 . DNA was extracted from whole blood, with approval from
institutional review boards. Genotypes were called using the Birdseed/Birdsuite
algorithm 25 and analyses
were performed with PLINK v1.05 26 .
Association analyses used a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and logistic regression
with covariates for sample site and ancestry. In the simulations, we generated
datasets with pairs of unobserved variants and marker SNPs in varying degrees of
within-pair LD, based on the effective number of independent SNPs in the ISC and
assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium between different pairs
of SNPs. We considered a large grid of possible values for allele frequency and
effect size distributions, also varying the proportion of non-null variants and the
LD between causal allele and observed marker. We retained models that produced
similar profiles of target sample R 2 compared to the
original ISC analysis, for the same range of p T thresholds, and
calculated the implied total genetic variance under these models, assuming
additivity within and across loci. See Supplementary Information for details.
