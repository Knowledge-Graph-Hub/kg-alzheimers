Therapeutic modulation of eIF2α-phosphorylation rescues TDP-43 toxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease models

# Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative disease primarily impacting motor neurons. A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and Ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules. Unexpectedly, we found that genes that modulate stress granules are striking modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster , eIF2α phosphorylation is upregulated by TDP-43 toxicity in flies, and TDP-43 interacts with a central stress granule component polyA binding protein (PABP). In human ALS spinal cord neurons, PABP accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis. We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2α-phosphorylation in ALS models. This treatment mitigated TDP-43 toxicity in flies and mammalian neurons. These findings indicate that dysfunction induced by prolonged stress granule formation may contribute directly to ALS and that compounds that mitigate this process may represent a novel therapeutic approach.

## INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons, resulting in debilitating and lethal paralysis 1 , 2 . There is no cure and only one effective treatment, riluzole, which extends life by only 3 months on average. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. The genetic underpinnings of sporadic and familial ALS are heterogeneous and incompletely characterized, but almost all cases of ALS share a pathological endpoint: ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions that contain the RNA binding protein TDP-43 3 . Focus on TDP-43 and other RNA-binding proteins has intensified as mutations in members of an expanding family of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins with prion-like domains, FUS/TLS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA2B1, and hnRNPA1, have been found in ALS patients 4 – 7 . Efforts to identify the molecular functions of TDP-43 that may be relevant to its role in proteinopathy have elucidated several roles in RNA processing 8 , including a possible function in the formation and regulation of RNA granules that form in conditions of stress 9 – 11 .

When primary neurons and cultured cells are stressed, TDP-43 translocates from the nucleus to cytoplasmic stress granules 11 , 12 . Stress granules are thought to be protective during cellular stress, harboring translationally arrested poly(A)+ mRNA, polyA-binding protein (PABP), 40S ribosomal subunits, and eukaryotic initiation factors 13 . The importance of nuclear-to-cytosolic trafficking of TDP-43 in stressed cells is not yet clear. The parallels between these observations in cells and the cytoplasmic mis-localization of TDP-43 and inclusion formation in patient spinal cord tissue has raised the possibility that stress granule formation may represent sites of early protein aggregation in ALS 14 – 17 . Prolonged stress granule activity is predicted to lead to a prolonged stressed state and prolonged translational repression, which would be deleterious 15 , 18 – 20 . In prion disease models, sustained translational repression by eIF2α phosphorylation mediates neurodegeneration 21 , 22 .

To define toxic features of TDP-43 that may be relevant to human disease, we have used yeast and fly models coupled with human patient tissue analysis. Yeast and fly have proven to be powerful model systems for revealing mechanistic insight into several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases 23 – 28 . High throughput screens in yeast, coupled with functional testing in the Drosophila nervous system, have been highly successful at identifying modifiers of disease genes with findings that extend to the human condition 5 , 25 . Here we find that a genome-wide yeast screen revealed genes in RNA metabolism, including several RNA-binding proteins with connections to stress granules, as critical to TDP-43 toxicity. Pursuing this, we unexpectedly found that eiF2α-phosphorylation, indicative of stress granules and translational repression, becomes abnormally upregulated upon TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration in Drosophila , and key genes that modulate eiF2α–phosphorylation dramatically affect the ability of TDP-43 to be neurotoxic. We pursued these studies to reveal a role of polyA binding protein, then extended these studies to show that a small molecule that mitigates eiF2α-phosphorylation may provide a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in disease.

## RESULTS
We previously developed a TDP-43 yeast model that recapitulates key features of TDP-43 associated with disease including toxicity and aggregation 29 , 30 . Using this model, we performed a screen for genes that when upregulated would modify TDP-43 toxicity 25 , 29 – 31 . A yeast query strain carrying an integrated copy of TDP-43 under the control of a galactose inducible promoter was transformed with the yeast FLEX gene library, which contains an arrayed set of 5500 genes that are overexpressed upon galactose induction 24 , 32 . Transformed yeast cells were subsequently plated on glucose (TDP-43 expression OFF) and galactose plates (TDP-43 expression ON), and screened for genes that suppressed or enhanced TDP-43 toxicity. We identified 40 hits, which included 13 suppressors and 27 enhancers of TDP-43 toxicity ( Table 1 ). GO term analysis on the entire set of screen hits showed a striking enrichment in RNA metabolic process, cell cycle, transport and protein modification process genes ( Fig. 1a ). While there was little overlap between the hits found in this TDP-43 screen and in a previous FUS overexpression screen 33 , both screens were enriched for RNA metabolic processes, and to a lesser extent cell cycle genes ( Fig. 1a,b ). We performed the screen in triplicate, and hits confirmed all three times were independently verified with more sensitive spotting assays ( Fig. 1c ).

Analysis of the TDP-43 screen hits revealed that stress granule and P-body components (involved in RNA triage and degradation 34 ) were significantly enriched ( Table 1 ; 5 out of 40 hits, 12.5%, versus 50 out of 6311 genes in the yeast genome, 0.8%; P =1x10 −4 ). These included both enhancers and suppressors of toxicity ( Fig. 1b,c ). Among the genes was PBP1, the yeast homolog of Ataxin-2, which we previously defined as a protein that synergizes with TDP-43 in promoting toxicity, and whose polyQ repeat expansions are a genetic contributor to ALS 25 , 35 – 37 . Because of the importance of RNA metabolic processes in ALS pathogenesis 36 and the enrichment of RNA-binding proteins as modifiers, we performed a network analysis of the identified RNA-binding proteins, defining genetic and physical interactions between hits and additional genes that interacted with the hits ( Fig. 1d ). Strikingly, this analysis revealed multiple interactions between genes from the screen and PAB1 , which encodes polyA-binding protein. Additionally, a previously uncharacterized yeast gene, YGR054W , was identified as interacting physically and genetically with several of the TDP-43 modifier genes ( Fig. 1d ); YGR054W encodes the yeast homolog of a translation initiation factor EIF2A 38 . This network analysis and the additional interactors predicted by it helped us to focus our further analyses on PAB1 and translation initiation factors (see below).

Given these findings, we then asked whether TDP-43 colocalized with the stress granule marker PUB1. These studies revealed that TDP-43 accumulations in yeast co-localize with PUB1 ( Fig. 1e ). Stress granule and P-body markers have been found to colocalize with TDP-43 aggregates in patient samples and multiple models of disease 10 , 39 , the results of this unbiased genetic screen indicate that stress granule components, and the stressed state induced by such components, may play a direct role in TDP-43 toxicity, as modifying their expression impacts TDP-43 toxicity. Thus, not only are RNA granules markers of TDP-43 pathology in disease, but they may play a more direct role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

To test the significance of the interaction between stress granules and ALS-associated RNA binding protein toxicity in the nervous system, we used Drosophila . Although it is challenging to image stress granules in vivo in flies, eIF2α-phosphorylation induces the accumulation of non-functional translation initiation complexes that concentrate in stress granules, thus levels of eIF2α-phosphorylation are directly correlated with the levels of stress granules 13 . We extracted protein from heads of control and TDP-43-expressing animals, and immunoblotted extracts with a phospho-specific eIF2α antibody (Ser51). This approach revealed a progressive increase in eIF2α-phosphorylation upon expression of TDP-43 in the brain: there was no difference between control and TDP-43-expressing flies in the levels of eIF2α-phosphorylation at 5d, but by 8d and 14d, the levels of eIF2α-phosphorylation were significantly increased to 1.4±0.1-fold (s.e.m.), and 1.6±0.1-fold (s.e.m.), respectively ( Fig. 2a ). There was no observed increase in levels of eIF2α protein, showing that the change in phospho-eIF2α levels represented a change in the stress granule specific form ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These data suggest that TDP-43 expression in the fly brain induces chronic eIF2α-phosphorylation. Moreover, the increase in eIF2α-phosphorylation indicates a state of prolonged translational repression 22 .

To determine whether modulation of this could have an effect on TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration, we examined whether altering the levels of key genes that impact eIF2α-phosphorylation could modulate TDP-43 toxicity in vivo . We knocked down the levels of PEK , Rox8 , and Gadd34 by RNAi in the presence of TDP-43 and examined the progressive effects on TDP-43-induced climbing dysfunction. PEK is the homolog of mammalian PERK and is a kinase that phosphorylates eIF2α, Rox8 is the Drosophila homologue of TIA1 which facilitates the physical aggregation of stress granules, and Gadd34 is a phosphatase for eIF2α 40 – 43 . In mammalian cell lines, loss of PERK blocks calcium-induced stress granule formation, stimulation of eIF2α-phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for stress granule induction 44 , expression of dominant negative TIA1 prevents stress granule formation 45 , and GADD34 inhibitor treatment induces massive stress granule formation 46 . Thus, reduction of PEK and Rox8 are predicted to inhibit, whereas knockdown of Gadd34 should enhance, stress granule formation in Drosophila .

Flies expressing TDP-43 show a markedly reduced climbing ability compared to normal animals aged to 14d (28±5% (95% CI) compared to 82±5% in controls, Fig. 2b ). This climbing deficit was greatly suppressed by knockdown of either Rox8 or PEK, with 62±6% (95%CI) of flies retaining climbing ability; conversely, knockdown of Gadd34 led TDP-43-expressing flies to lose their motility almost entirely ( Fig. 2b ). Importantly, we confirmed that downregulation of PEK decreased eIF2α-phosphorylation, and that Gadd34 increased eIF2α-phosphorylation ( Fig. 2c ). Knockdown of Gadd34, PEK or Rox8 on their own had no effect on climbing abillity (data not shown). Intriguingly, Gadd34 reduction, which enhanced TDP-43 toxicity in our locomotion assay, also led to accumulation of TDP-43 protein in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2d ). Taken together, these data indicate that TDP-43-induced neural toxicity can be dramatically enhanced and suppressed by altering genes that converge on eIF2α phosphorylation.

To provide more insight into this potentially critical role of stress granules in TDP-43 toxicity, we investigated in greater detail the interaction between Ataxin-2 and TDP-43. Ataxin-2, like TDP-43, localizes to stress granules and regulates their assembly and functions 47 , 48 . PolyQ expansions in Ataxin-2 are a risk for ALS, and the Ataxin-2 protein has several functional motifs including one for the key stress granule protein, PolyA Binding Protein (PABP) 49 . We generated transgenic fly lines that express human Ataxin-2 with a normal length polyQ repeat (ATXN2-22Q), or an expanded repeat within the risk range for ALS (ATXN2-32Q). As with fly Ataxin-2 25 , co-expression of either protein with TDP-43 dramatically enhanced toxicity, with faster loss of lifespan and climbing ability ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Intriguingly, ATXN2-32Q enhanced the toxicity of TDP-43 measured by lifespan more significantly than ATXN2-22Q, demonstrating that an expansion of only ten glutamine repeats from normal into the ALS-associated range has a significant effect in vivo.

Ataxin-2 has two key domains implicated in RNA binding function ( Fig. 3a ): the Lsm (like Sm) domain is important for RNA binding affinity 50 , whereas the PAM2 motif mediates interaction with PABP 51 . We generated domain deletion forms of ATXN2-32Q and selected transgenic lines that express these proteins at the same level as intact ATXN2-32Q. Expression of the deletion-bearing ATXN2-32Q proteins alone showed effects comparable to the intact ATXN2-32Q protein: a mild disruption of retinal structure and slightly reduced lifespan ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). When we then assessed the ability of these forms to enhance toxicity of TDP-43. Strikingly, whereas the ATXN2-Q32-ΔLSM protein acted the same as ATXN2-Q32, the ATXN2-32Q-ΔPAM2 protein completely lost the ability to interact with TDP-43 in retinal toxicity ( Fig. 3b-c ). These results were similar for lifespan and climbing ability, with the ATXN2-32Q-ΔPAM2 form showing almost complete loss of interaction with TDP-43 ( Fig. 3 ). TDP-43 protein accumulation was also unaffected by ATXN2-32Q-ΔPAM2 ( Fig. 3e ), consistent with functional loss of the interaction. This finding raised the possibility that PABP, which binds the PAM2 motif, may have a role in TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration and that the shared interaction of TDP-43 and Ataxin-2 with PABP may represent a critical axis in stress granule formation and the biological effects of that stress.

To investigate the potential role of PABP in ALS-associated gene toxicity, we examined the effects of the fly gene dPABP (the Drosophila homologue of the cytoplasmic protein PABPC1) on toxicity of TDP-43 and ATXN2. Whereas upregulation of dPABP on its own had minimal effects, co-expression with either TDP-43 or ATXN2-32Q enhanced toxicity, resulting in more severe retinal degeneration ( Fig. 4a ). Consistent with a role for dPABP in conveying toxicity due to the interaction of TDP-43 with ATXN2, dPABP did not modulate ATXN2-32Q-ΔPAM2 ( Fig. 4a ). The effect of dPABP on TDP-43 was exquisitely dose-dependent: reduction of endogenous levels using RNAi significantly delayed the progressive loss of motility that occurs upon expression of TDP-43 in the nervous system ( Fig. 4b ). dPABP downregulation did not impact total TDP-43 protein levels in the brain, but did cause a reduction to 0.7±0.1 (s.e.m.) fold of the cytoplasmic levels of TDP-43, compared to TDP-43 with normal dPABP levels ( Fig. 4c ). Consistent with the essential function of the RNA binding activity of TDP-43, expression of TDP-43 with point mutations in the aromatic residues of the RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) 25 , 52 failed to induce neurodegeneration or synergize with ATXN2 or dPABP ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). We confirmed that dPABP had no effect on the efficiency of the GAL4/UAS driver system ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). These data indicate that interactions with PABP modulate TDP-43 toxicity, suggesting that PABP function may be critical in human disease.

To determine if PABP function may be altered in human disease, we immunostained control and ALS patient spinal cord tissue for PABPC1 protein, the cytoplasmic PABP, to examine whether there were pathological associations between PABPC1 localization and ALS disease. In control spinal cord neurons, PABPC1 shows a diffuse cytoplasmic localization pattern in most neurons ( Fig. 5a ), occasionally being present in denser accumulations (2±0.7% (s.e.m.) motor neurons, Fig. 5b, 5e ). In ALS patient spinal cord tissue, robust cytoplasmic inclusions of PABPC1 were observed in 13±4% (s.e.m.) of motor neurons ( Fig. 5c-e ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Recent analysis of co-localization pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 with PABPC1 indicated ~70% overlap in ALS human tissues 10 . These data suggest that interactions with or altered function of PABPC1 may occur in ALS disease, and that these punctate accumulations containing PABPC1 in ALS spinal cords may represent structures with a functional role similar to that of stress granules, and be indicative of a prolonged stress state and associated altered signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings raised the possibility that treatment approaches that alter activities that impact stress granules, and their contingent effects on translation and signaling pathways, may impact ALS disease progression.

To test the idea that targeting eIF2α-phosphorylation in a therapeutic manner may modulate TDP-43 toxicity in the nervous system, we turned back to the fly. Our data with gene manipulation indicated that inhibition of PEK activity might be effective to mitigate TDP-43 toxicity. Compounds that inhibit PERK, the human homologue of PEK, have been developed. We therefore tested whether treating flies with the PERK inhibitor compound GSK2606414 53 could impact TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration. Flies fed 10uM GSK2606414 showed a markedly reduced level of eIF2a-phosphorylation, to 63±3% (s.e.m.) of that in heads of TDP-43-expressing animals ( Fig. 6a ). Remarkably, at this level of treatment, there was a dramatic mitigation of TDP-43-induced climbing dysfunction: whereas normally at 12d, TDP-43-expressing flies had only 18±5% (95% CI) climbing ability, with inhibitor treatment they now retained 42±7% (95% CI) climbing ability ( Fig. 6b ).

To extend these studies to the mammalian neurons, we assessed the ability of the PERK inhibitor to mitigate toxicity of TDP-43 to primary neurons. Rat primary cortical neurons were transfected with two constructs: one expressing mApple, and the other expressing either enhanced green florescent protein (EGFP) alone or EGFP tagged TDP-43. We imaged ~800–1000 individual neurons from each condition at 24-hr intervals for 7d using automated microscopy 54 . Death of neurons was scored by the loss of detectable cell body mApple fluorescence. Previous studies have shown that upregulation of TDP-43 is toxic to neurons, inducing degeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 and aggregation of the protein 55 , thus reflecting fundamental features of pathological TDP-43 associated with disease. To then assess the ability of GSK2606414 to mitigate TDP-43 toxicity, we first performed a dose-response to the compound, testing a range of compound concentrations (100, 250, 500nM, 1, 2, 5 uM). Concentrations of 1 uM or higher were deleterious on their own, but the nM concentrations were tolerated ( Fig. 6d-e ; Supplementary Table 2 ). We thus assessed the effect of compound on TDP-43 toxicity with concentrations of 100, 250 and 500 nM. These studies showed that treatment of primary neurons with PERKi GSK2606414 mitigated TDP-43 toxicity at 250 and 500 nM ( p <0.01, Fig. 6e , Supplementary Table 2c ). Taken together, these data indicate that prolonged activity of eIF2α-phosphorylation functionally impacts TDP-43 toxicity, and suggest the possibility that compounds that mitigate this, such as GSK2606414, could be developed as a therapeutic strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies.

## DISCUSSION
A common biological feature of several RNA-binding proteins connected to neurodegenerative diseases is their localization to cytoplasmic stress granules, and a working hypothesis for disease is that stress granule formation facilitates or promotes TDP-43 aggregation in ALS 11 , 15 , 17 – 20 , 39 Moreover, stress granule markers such as TIA1 and eIF3 co-localize with TDP-43 inclusions in ALS and the clinicopathologically-related disorder, FTLD-U 16 . However, the relationship between these observations and neurotoxicity is not clear. These findings do suggest, however, that ALS may be associated with a prolonged stress state and the outcome of such a state. Thus, it has been unclear whether genes that impact stress granule formation could directly affect TDP-43 neurotoxicity. The impact of prolonged stress granules would long-term translational repression and altered signalling pathways; sustained translational repression is thought to be causal in prion-mediated neurodegeneration and mitigating this has an effect to mitigate disease 21 , 22 . Here, we show that eIF2α-phosphorylation is increased upon TDP-43-induced neural dysfunction in Drosophila , that genes that are implicated in stress granule formation impact TDP-43 toxicity in yeast, and that TDP-43 induced climbing deficits are mitigated by knockdown of genes whose activity normally modulates eIF2α-phosphorylation. Moreover, the interaction between Ataxin-2 and TDP-43 is mediated through PABP, which is mislocalized in ALS. As a proof of principle that modulating eIF2α-phosphorylation could be beneficial, a small molecule inhibitor of PERK activity significantly suppressed TDP-43 toxicity in vivo in the fly , and mitigated TDP-43 toxicity to mammalian primary cortical neurons. Thus, inhibitory activity of molecules on stress granule formation, and thus on a potentially prolonged stress state in disease, may accurately gauge potential therapeutic activity in vivo . Molecules that decrease stress granule formation or stability could be a promising treatment avenue for ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies. Such compounds may affect TDP-43 accumulation, and also mitigate the outcome of prolonged stress on cells that contributes to their degeneration.

## Online Methods
The query strain was generated by integrating TDP-43 into the HIS3 locus using a p303-GAL-TDP-43 vector 25 . Plasmids from the yeast FLEXgene collection (5500 full-length yeast ORFs) were transformed into the query strain. The screen was performed similarly to previous screens 33 and as described 25 , 31 . The screen was replicated three times and only those hits that consistently reproduced were considered to be modifiers of TDP-43. A control strain with YFP (p303-GAL-YFP) integrated into the HIS3 locus was used in experiments to confirm that the overexpression strains did not lead to toxicity or a growth advantage when expressed in the absence of TDP-43. GO-term analysis of the hits was performed using the GO-slim mapper tool available at the SGD website, www.yeastgenome.org . GeneMANIA 56 was used to search for interacting genes based physical and genetic interactions.

PEG/Lithium acetate yeast transformations and spotting assays were performed according to standard protocols.

A plasmid expressing PUB1-mCherry, a stress granule marker 57 , was transformed into the wild type yeast strain BY4741. Subsequently, p415-GAL-GFP or p415-GAL-TDP-43-GFP plasmids were transformed into the strain. The TDP-43 expression plasmid was created using an LR reaction with the destination vector p415-GAL-ccdB-GFP and the donor vector pDONR221-TDP-43 (CCSB Human ORFeome Collection).

Transformants were grown overnight in raffinose-containing selective media (CSM-Ura-Leu) and then added to galactose-containing selective media and allowed to grow for 6 hours to induce the expression of the galactose inducible genes. Yeasts were mounted in the media they were growing in on coverslips coated with concanavalin A (Sigma #L7647) 58 . Images were captured on a Leica DM6000B with a ProEM EMCCD camera (Princeton Instruments).

Drosophila stocks were maintained on standard cornmeal agar media at 25°C unless otherwise noted. elav 3A –GAL4 was a gift from Mark A. Tanouye 59 . UAS-TDP-43 is described previously 25 . The Bloomington stock center provided other fly stocks.

For generating random insertion transgenic lines, we used the pUAST vector 60 . Human ATXN2 cDNA that has 32 CAG repeats was cloned into pUAST vector as BglII-XbaI fragments. The pUAST-ATXN2-Q32-ΔPAM2 construct was generated by deleting the region encoding amino acids 910-922 of the PAM2 domain. The pUAST-ATXN2-32Q construct containing encoding the full length ATXN2 protein with 32Q repeats was used as a template for two PCR reactions. The region 5′ of the PAM2 domain was amplified using a forward primer containing an attached Bgl II cut site primer PAM2-N1 (primer sequences listed in Supplementary Table 3 ) and a reverse primer complimentary to the beginning of the PAM2 domain and containing an attached Hind III cut site primer PAM2-N2. The region 3′ of the PAM2 domain was amplified using a forward primer complimentary to the end of the PAM2 domain and containing an attached Hind III cut site primer PAM2-C1 and a reverse primer containing an attached Xba I cut site primer PAM2-C2. Each PCR product was subcloned into TOPO vectors, cloned into pUAST vectors, cut out of the pUAST vector, ligated together, and reinserted into a pUAST vector.

Similarly, the pUAST-ATXN2-Q32-ΔLSM construct was generated by deleting the region encoding amino acids 267-325 of the PAM2 domain. The pUAST-ATXN2-Q32 construct was used as a template for two PCR reactions. The region 5′ of the LSM domain was amplified using a forward primer containing an attached Bgl II cut site primer LSM-N1 and a reverse primer complimentary to the beginning of the LSM domain and containing an attached Hind III cut site primer LSM-N2. The region 3′ of the LSM domain was amplified using a forward primer complimentary to the end of the LSM domain and containing an attached Hind III cut site primer LSM-C1, and a reverse primer containing an attached Xba I cut site primer LSM-C2. Each PCR product was subcloned into TOPO vectors, cloned into pUAST vectors, cut out of the pUAST vector, ligated together, and reinserted into a pUAST vector.

For generation of site-specific integration transgenic lines, we used pJFRC5 and pJFRC5-myc vector 61 . ATXN2 cDNAs that with 32 CAG or 22 CAG repeats were cloned into pJFRC5-myc vector as Swa I -Xba I fragment. These DNA constructs were integrated into the attP2 landing site.

For fly eye pictures, we used a Leica Z16-Apo A motorized zoom microscope system with DFC420 digital camera and Leica Application Suite Montage module software (Leica Microsystems). Retinal tissue was visualized by autofluorescence in horizontal paraffin sections. 0-1d males were used for experiments.

0-1d males were separated and transferred onto experimental vials containing fly media mixed with or without RU486 (20μg/ml or 40μg/ml) at a density of 20 (for life span) or 25 (for climbing assay) flies per vial. Dead flies were scored everyday and flies were transferred to fresh media every other day. All flies for climbing assays or life span analysis raised at 29°C. Adult locomotor function was assessed by a previously described method, with 125 flies per genotype per time point in all experiments, except for SFig. 2d where 150 flies per genotype per time point were used 62 . Experiments were repeated twice to assure consistent results.

For total protein extraction, 10 male fly heads were homogenized in 1X LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). For subcellular fractionation, 20 male fly heads were lysed in NE-PER extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracts (equivalent to 2 heads/lane) were then run on 3–8% Tris Acetate gel or 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-TDP-43 (1:800, Proteintech, catalog # 10782-2-AP); anti-β-Actin (1:2000, Abcam, catalog # ab16039); anti-α-Tubulin (1:2000, conjugated with HRP, Cell Signaling, catalog # 9099); anti-Lamin C (1:1000, Deveopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, catalog # LC28.26); anti-phospho-eIF2α (1:1000, Cell signaling tech, Catalog #9722); anti-mouse-Ataxin-2 (1:300, BD biosciences, catalog # 6113378), anti-rabbit-eIF2α (1:1000, Abcam, catalog # ab26197) and anti-mouse β-galactosidase (Promega, catalog # Z3781). After incubation with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit diluted 1:2000 and goat anti-mouse diluted 1:2000; Pierce), blots were visualized using ECL plus or prime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of Western blots was performed using ImageGauge4.22 (GE Healthcare).

Human spinal cord tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin was processed into paraffin wax. The tissue was cut into 7 μm sections and PABPC1 was immunolocalized with antigen retrieval (Antigen unmasking solution, citric acid based, Vector Laboratories, catalog # H-3300) and the avidin-biotin complex detection method with 3,3-diaminobenzidine as the chromagen (Vectastain ABC detection kit, Vector Labs, catalog # PK-6100). PABPC1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was used at 1:800 (Cell Signaling, catalog # 4992S). Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, catalogue #: BA-1000) was used at 1:1000. Stained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.

GSK2606414 (PERK inhibitor, EMD Millipore, catalog #: 516535) was added directly to media from a 1mg/ml stock (dissolved in DMSO) to give final concentration 10μM. The same amount of DMSO was added for vehicle control.

For climbing and immunoblot quantifications, data were analyzed by Student’s t -test (Vassar Stats, www.vassarstats.net ) or first analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (GraphPad Prism Software, La Jolla, CA). Human immunohistochemistry data was analyzed by one-tailed Mann-Whitney test (VassarStats). Differences were considered significant when p <0.05, and are indicated as follows: * p <0.05; ** p <0.01; *** p <0.001; # p <0.0001; n.s., not significant.

For primary cell culture, human TDP43 was cloned into pGW1-CMV plasmid, C-terminally fused to EGFP as described 55 . EGFP and mApple were cloned into pGW1-CMV as described 55 , 63 .

Cortical neurons were isolated from E20-21 Long Evans rat embryos (Charles River) and cultured at 100,000 cells/well of 96 well plate in serum-free Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, GlutaMax, and pen/strep (Invitrogen). At 4d in vitro (DIV), neurons were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per manufacturers protocol. Neurons were cotransfected with plasmids encoding survival markers (mApple) or proteins of interest (TDP43-EGFP or EGFP control) in a 1:1 molar ratio for a total of 0.2 μg total DNA per well. After transfection cells were returned to Neurobasal media mixed 1:1 with conditioned media. For cells treated with PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414, CalBiochem), drug was added once immediately after transfection.

For neuronal survival analysis, we use a robotic imaging system as described 63 . Briefly, images are obtained with an inverted Nikon microscope (Ti-E) equipped with PerfectFocus, an extra-long working distance (ELWD) 20x objective lens, and a back-illuminated Andor iXON 888 14-bit, cooled, electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD). Illumination is provided a xenon lamp and liquid light guide. All movements of the stage are controlled with electrical stepper motors. Coordination of fluorescence excitation and emission filters, stage movements, focusing, and imaging acquisition are accomplished with custom-designed and commercially available programs.

Digitized images were assembled into montages in Pipeline Pilot and ImageJ using original programs. Background fluorescence from neighboring regions of interest was subtracted, montages from each time point are assembled into stacks in chronological order and aligned with one another. Cell bodies of transfected neurons, identified by morphology marker fluorescence (mApple), were automatically segmented and followed over time. Cell death was determined by an abrupt loss of fluorescence, indicating shrinkage or disappearance of the cell body. The time of death for each neuron was considered the last time that the neuron was present. Kaplan-Meier and cumulative risk of death curves were generated in R. Statistical significance of survival differences between cohorts of neurons is determined by the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards analysis used to measure the relative change in the risk of death attributed to various experimental conditions.
