# Title
Axonal transport of TDP-43 mRNA granules in neurons is impaired by ALS-causing mutations

# Abstract
The RNA binding protein TDP-43 regulates RNA metabolism at multiple
levels, including transcription, RNA splicing, and mRNA stability. TDP-43 is a
major component of the cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and some types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The
importance of TDP-43 in disease is underscored by the fact that dominant
missense mutations are sufficient to cause disease, although the role of TDP-43
in pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic mRNP
granules that undergo bidirectional, microtubule-dependent transport in neurons in vitro and in vivo and facilitate
delivery of target mRNA to distal neuronal compartments. TDP-43 mutations impair
this mRNA transport function in vivo and in
vitro , including in stem cell-derived motor neurons from ALS
patients bearing any one of three different TDP-43 ALS-causing mutations. Thus,
TDP43 mutations that cause ALS lead to partial loss of a novel cytoplasmic
function of TDP-43.

## Introduction
Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a highly conserved,
ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that is primarily
nuclear, but shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. TDP-43 was initially
identified as a transcription repressor ( Ou et al.,
1995 ) and splicing regulator ( Buratti et
al., 2001 ), but later recognized as the major component of pathological
cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and inclusion body myopathy ( Neumann et al., 2006 ; Salajegheh et al., 2009 ). Dominant mutations in TDP-43 are
sufficient to cause familial forms of those diseases, underscoring its role in
pathogenesis ( Al-Chalabi et al., 2012 ). The
identification of mutations in related RNA processing proteins has focused interest
on perturbed RNA metabolism as a potential common defect underlying
neurodegenerative diseases ( Kim et al., 2013 ; Kwiatkowski et al., 2009 ; Lefebvre et al., 1995 ; Ramaswami et al., 2013 ), yet the role(s) of TDP-43 in RNA
metabolism is far from complete. How disease-causing mutations disrupt TDP-43
function(s), the relative contribution of toxic gain vs. loss of function to
disease, and the cellular compartment(s) in which this perturbation occurs, remains
to be determined.

TDP-43 binds to thousands of mRNAs, many of which are important in brain
development and synaptic function, but regulates alternative splicing of a small
subset of these ( Colombrita et al., 2012 ; Polymenidou et al., 2011 ; Tollervey et al., 2011 ; Xiao et al., 2011 ). Isolation of TDP-43 from a cytoplasmic
fraction of human brain revealed binding to the 3'-UTR of numerous target mRNAs,
suggesting a role in mRNA stability and/or transport ( Tollervey et al., 2011 ). TDP-43 co-purifies with proteins
involved in RNA transport ( Freibaum et al.,
2010 ), is trafficked in neurons ( Fallini
et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2008 ),
and is detected in distal compartments such as the presynaptic membrane of axon
terminals in the neuromuscular junction in mice ( Narayanan et al., 2012 ). As such, it has been suggested that TDP-43
plays a role in the transport of certain target mRNAs into distal neuronal
processes, but direct evidence is lacking ( Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010 ). The extent to which this hypothetical
function might be compromised by disease mutations has not been explored.

TDP-43 is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, and knockout of
the gene encoding TDP-43 is lethal in mouse ( Sephton et al., 2010 ). We used several model systems, including Drosophila , mouse, and human stem cell–derived motor
neurons to systematically study TDP-43 function and the consequence of disease
mutations. Drosophila that lack TBPH, the TDP-43 ortholog,
typically die as pupae and escapers exhibit motor neuron synaptic dysfunction,
progressive loss of motor neurons, and reduced life span ( Diaper et al., 2013 ; Feiguin et al., 2009 ; Vanden†Broeck et al., 2013 ). This loss of function phenotype
can be rescued by stably introducing wild-type human TDP-43
(TDP-43 WT ) illustrating conservation of TDP-43 function and
validating Drosophila as a relevant model system ( Fig. S1A ). By contrast,
introduction of TDP-43 harboring ALS-causing mutations (TDP-43 M337V )
at equivalent expression levels fails to rescue the motor neuron defect ( Fig. S1A ), suggesting
that at least one consequence of disease-causing mutation is partial loss of
function. To study TDP-43 in Drosophila in more detail we used
PhiC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis to generate animals expressing equal
levels of fluorescently tagged TDP-43 WT , or either of the two
ALS-causing mutants TDP-43 M337V or TDP-43 A315T ,and
monitored protein localization in motor neurons of animals with matched total
expression levels ( Fig. S1
G-H ). The distribution of TDP-43 WT was primarily nuclear
as expected, ( Fig. S1 B-C,
G ), but we also observed numerous cytoplasmic granules along the
length of axons and extending into the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where
TDP-43 fluorescence was diffuse ( Fig. S1 G ). By contrast, TDP-43 M337V and
TDP-43 A315T accumulated in the cell soma and proximal axons
( Fig. S1 B-D ) but
was absent or reduced at distal axons and the NMJ ( Fig. S1 E-F ). Live
imaging of Drosophila motor neurons revealed that both
wild-type ( Movie S1 )
and mutant TDP-43 granules were transported bidirectionally for long distances
with brief pauses ( Fig. 1 A ). We also
observed that mutant TDP-43 granules were not transported efficiently along
neuronal axons and displayed a less continuous movement that is evident when
plotted using kymographs ( Fig. 1A-F ). The
marked difference in subcellular distribution and transport behavior of
wild-type and mutant TDP-43 prompted us to analyze the kinetics of TDP-43
transport in motor neurons. We observed a significant reduction in net
anterograde displacement of TDP-43 M337V and TDP-43 A315T granules relative to TDP-43 WT granules (p= 0.027 and 0.018
respectively; Fig. 1G , Table S1 ). Interestingly,
we also observed that a greater fraction of TDP-43 M337V and
TDP-43 A315T granules moved in the retrograde direction relative
to TDP-43 WT granules ( Fig. 1I ).
These data suggest impaired anterograde movement of TDP-43 M337V and
TDP-43 A315T granules along motor neuron axons in
vivo , leading to mutant TDP-43 accumulation in the cytoplasm and
proximal axons and deficiency at the NMJ.

The presence of TDP-43 in cytoplasmic granules in vivo that are dynamic and transported along axons in Drosophila ,
prompted us to study the biology of these motile granules in primary mouse
cortical neurons. Under normal conditions, endogenous TDP-43 was predominantly
nuclear, as described previously ( Barmada et al.,
2010 ), though cytoplasmic puncta in neurites were also observed in
most cells ( Fig. S2A ).
Exogenous expression of mCherry-TDP-43 WT showed the same
distribution, and enabled live imaging of TDP-43 ( Fig. S2B-C ). Time-lapse
imaging of mCherry-tagged TDP-43 granules in the axons of cortical neurons
maintained in culture for 5 to 7 days revealed rapid, bidirectional,
intermittent movement ( Fig. 2A-B ),
consistent with the kinetics of TDP-43 granule transport observed in Drosophila motor neurons. The instantaneous velocities of
TDP-43 granules in vivo and in vitro ( Table S1 ) were consistent
with microtubule-dependent fast axonal transport. TDP-43 granule movement was
unaffected by treatment with latrunculin, which disrupts actin filaments, but
abolished by treatment with nocodazole, which disrupts microtubules ( Fig. 2C ). This microtubule-dependent
transport of TDP-43 granules is consistent with long-range axonal transport of
protein complexes in neurons ( Brown,
2013 ). To determine whether the ALS-causing mutations in TDP-43 influence
granule trafficking, we compared trafficking parameters in neurons transfected
with either mCherry-TDP-43 WT , mCherry–TDP-43 M337 ,
or mCherry–TDP-43 A315T . Although the granule transport
instantaneous velocities were indistinguishable,
mCherry–TDP-43 M337 and
mCherry–TDP-43 A315T granules were more frequently immotile
(p=0.036 and 0.0027, respectively) and reversed direction significantly more
frequently (p=0.0017 and 0.0032, respectively; Fig
2 D-E ). These altered trafficking parameters of mutant TDP-43
granules were reflected in significant reductions in net displacement of
TDP-43 M337V and TDP-43 A315T (TDP-43 M337V :
p<0.001 in both directions; TDP-43 A315T : p= 0.030 anterograde
and 0.045 retrograde; Fig. 2F , Table S1 ). Interestingly,
we observed a significant increase in retrograde movement of mutant TDP-43
granules as compared to wild-type (TDP-43 M337V : p= 0.037;
TDP-43 A315T : p= 0.042; Fig.
2H ).

To determine whether TDP-43 mutations result in generalized disruption of
anterograde transport, we monitored mitochondrial trafficking and TDP-43 granule
trafficking simultaneously in the same cells . In primary cortical neurons,
axonal transport of mitochondria was indistinguishable between cells expressing
WT or mutant TDP-43 (M337V or A315T mutants) at 5-7 days in culture ( Fig. 2G, I ; Table S1 ) despite a
significant defect in axonal transport of TDP-43 granules. We conclude that
TDP-43 mutation results in a selective defect in the trafficking of
TDP-43-containing granules, although this could lead to broader cellular
toxicity and a more generalized defect in axonal transport in neurons cultured
for longer periods of time ( Wang et al.,
2013 ).

We and others have shown that TDP-43 interacts with a network of
RNA-binding proteins ( Fallini et al.,
2012 ; Freibaum et al., 2010 ; Ling et al., 2010 ). The TDP-43
interactome includes numerous proteins involved in RNA trafficking, suggesting
that some fraction of TDP-43 is a component of mRNP granules transported along
neuronal axons. TDP-43 co-immunopurifies and colocalizes with the RNA
trafficking protein Staufen ( Fig. S3 A-B ). Further, we determined that actively transported
axonal TDP-43 granules stain positively with SYTO RNASelect Green fluorescent
stain, consistent with the notion that TDP-43 granules transported along axons
of cortical neurons contain RNA ( Fig. S3C ).

A limitation of SYTO RNASelect stain is that it is a non-specific,
general RNA dye. To investigate the association of TDP-43 with one of its
well-characterized mRNA targets, we designed a “mRNA beacon”
consisting of a Cy3-tagged oligonucleotide that specifically hybridizes to mouse
or human Neurofilament-L ( Nefl or NEFL ,
respectively) mRNA and studied mRNA trafficking in live cells ( Fig. 3A , Fig. S3 D-E ).
Neurofilament-L mRNA has a consensus TDP-43 binding site in its 3’-UTR
and binds TDP-43 in extracts from human and mouse brain tissue ( Polymenidou et al., 2011 ; Volkening et al., 2009 ). Fluorescence
emission from the mRNA beacon is quenched until hybridization to Nefl mRNA and conjugation to a NeutrAvidin polypeptide
prevents accumulation of beacon in the nucleus ( Fig. 3A ; Fig.
S3E ). Live-fluorescent imaging of mouse cortical neurons showed that Nefl mRNA is present throughout the axonal compartment and
can be observed distally, even in the growth cones ( Fig. 3B-C ). Nefl mRNP granules moved
bidirectionally along axons with intermittent rapid movements indistinguishable
from those of TDP-43 granules ( Fig. 3D , Movie S2 ). Nefl mRNP granules existed in two fractions: co-localized
with fluorescently labeled TDP-43 ( Fig. 3E )
and those without any TDP-43 staining. Importantly, these two fractions showed
different trafficking behavior. Specifically, Nefl mRNP
granules that contained TDP-43 showed net anterograde movement, whereas those Nefl mRNP granules without TDP-43 showed net retrograde
movement ( Fig. 3F ). We conclude that TDP-43
is specifically associated with mRNP granules that promote anterograde transport
of certain mRNAs, is a marker of such granules, and could even participate in
this process.

The data derived from Drosophila motor neurons and mouse
cortical neurons consistently show that TDP-43 granules undergo bidirectional
transport and that this is selectively impaired by ALS-causing mutations in
TDP-43. These data were generated by monitoring the trafficking of exogenous,
fluorescently-tagged TDP-43. While this is standard in the trafficking field,
there remains a possibility that over-expression of TDP-43 influences its
behavior in these assays. The mRNA beacon we describe here, combined with recent
advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology to generate motor
neurons from ALS patients, affords a novel opportunity to corroborate our
results in a relevant human cell type with endogenous wild-type or mutant TDP-43
expressed at physiological levels. Thus, we analyzed NEFL transport in iPS cell-derived human motor neurons carrying both of the
ALS-causing mutations we analyzed in Drosophila and mouse
cortical neurons (M337V and A315T) and one additional ALS-causing mutation
(G298S). The cells derived from an ALS patient with the M337V mutation were
described previously ( Bilican et al.,
2012 ). These motor neurons exhibit increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 in the
soma, accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 and accelerated cell death relative to
control cells ( Bilican et al., 2012 ). We
monitored the movement of NEFL mRNP granules in axons of
HB9-positive control or ALS motor neurons (TDP-43 M337V ; patient 31)
in 3 time windows over 2 consecutive weeks following plating and prior to the
observation of cell toxicity. NEFL mRNP granules underwent
bidirectional, rapid movements that were interrupted by brief pauses in the
axons of control and ALS motor neurons ( Fig.
4B , Movie
S3 ). The cells were monitored for a period of 2 weeks, after which it was
not possible to clearly recognize individual axonal tracks extending from the
cell soma to the growth cones without obstruction by glial cells or a
significant decrease in the fluorescent intensity of the mRNA beacon. During the
first week after plating, granule transport velocities, net displacement and
directionality were indistinguishable between control and ALS motor neurons. By
days 9-13, a defect in the transport of NEFL mRNP granules
became apparent in ALS motor neurons. Specifically, anterograde transport of the NEFL mRNP granules significantly decreased ( Fig. 4C ). The frequency of reversals and the
overall fraction of retrogradely moving granules also increased significantly in
the ALS motor neurons (p=0.011 and p= 0.028, respectively), demonstrating less
efficient transport mechanisms of NEFL mRNA ( Fig.
4 C, E-F ).

Given the inherent variability in motor neurons differentiated from
human iPS cells, we generated additional control (Control line 2; patient 11
( Boulting et al., 2011 )) and mutant
iPS cell lines (TDP-43 G298S and TDP-43 A315T ; patients 47
and RB20, respectively) ( Fig. 4A , Fig S4 ). Examining these
additional cell lines permitted us to determine whether impaired TDP-43 granule
trafficking is solely a consequence of the M337V mutation or occurs more broadly
with other TDP-43 mutations. In these cells, we monitored the movement of NEFL mRNA granules in 4 time windows over 17 days following
plating. Our results again showed significant decrease in anterograde
displacement that was quite profound ~10 days after plating and becomes
progressively worse with time ( Fig. 4D ). We
observe a significant increase in the frequency of reversals and retrograde
movement of NEFL mRNA granules in iPS cell-derived motor
neurons from ALS patients as compared to wild type after 9 days in culture
( Fig. 4 D-E ).

## Discussion
Here we establish that TDP-43 is a component of mRNP transport granules in
neurons, including human stem cell-derived motor neurons, and identify a novel role
for TDP-43 in the cytoplasm supporting anterograde axonal transport of target mRNAs
from the soma to distal axonal compartments, including the NMJ. We also establish
that three different ALS-causing mutations of TDP-43 impair this cytoplasmic
function. This partial loss of function is consistent with the inability of mutant
TDP-43 to complement a deficiency of endogenous TBPH in Drosophila . This transport defect is specific for
TDP-43-positive mRNP granules, since another microtubule-dependent cargo in the same
cells is transported normally during the same observation window. We conclude that
deficient axonal transport of mRNA targeted by TDP-43 may contribute to pathogenesis
of ALS and related diseases such as FTD.

Given the dominant inheritance of TDP-43 mutations in ALS, this defect in
TDP-43 trafficking is unlikely to be the sole contribution of mutant TDP-43 to
disease. Nevertheless, this clear and consistent defect in TDP-43 granule transport
is likely an important contributor to ALS, perhaps influencing specific disease
features such as cell type specificity or the pattern of degeneration. ALS has been
described as a “distal axonopathy” because morphological abnormalities
of the distal axon, including dismantling of the NMJ leading to denervation, are
among the earliest pathological features ( Fischer et
al., 2004 ). Many of the mRNA targets of TDP-43 encode proteins that
function in this compartment but only a subset show differential splicing with
altered TDP-43 levels or TDP-43 mutations ( Arnold et
al., 2013 ; Lagier-Tourenne et al.,
2012 ; Polymenidou et al., 2011 ).
One might speculate that a failure of TDP-43 to adequately support spatially
appropriate translation of target mRNAs could contribute to this pattern of
neurodegeneration.

The mechanism whereby disease-causing mutations impair granule transport is
unclear, but could involve a defect in the ability of mutant TDP-43 granules to
engage motor proteins or a physical impediment to their movement based on some
abnormality in their size or shape. However, it is worth noting that these disease
mutations all impact a prion-like domain in the C-terminus of TDP-43. Prion-like
domains in TDP-43 and related RNA-binding proteins mediate the assembly of RNA
granules, and disease mutations in these prion-like domains disturb the dynamics of
RNA granule assembly and disassembly ( Ramaswami et
al., 2013 ). Normally, RNA transport granules in neurons are highly
dynamic ( Barbee et al., 2006 ) and this relates
to their ability to deliver mRNAs to distal sites for local translation ( Krichevsky and Kosik, 2001 ). The correlation
between the impairment of RNA granule dynamics and impairment of RNA granule
transport by ALS mutations suggests the possibility of a heretofore unappreciated
role for RNA granule dynamism and transport that will require additional research to
elucidate. The important take home messages from this study are that TDP-43 has a
cytoplasmic function that is impaired by disease-causing mutations; TDP-43 is a
component of neuronal RNA transport granules; association of target mRNAs with
TDP-43 correlates with their anterograde transport; and ALS-causing mutations in
TDP-43 impair this transport in vivo in Drosophila , in mouse cortical neurons, and in iPS-derived motor
neurons from ALS patients.

## Experimental Procedures
3 rd instar Drosophila larvae genotypes
OK371>Gal4/ UAS-Venus-TDP-43 WT, OK371>Gal4/ UAS-Venus-TDP-43
M337V, and OK371>Gal4/UAS-YFP-TDP-43 A315T were used for axonal transport
imaging. For TDP-43 quantification at the cell body and synaptic terminal,
UAS-CD8-RFP (Bloomington Stock Center, Indiana U, Bloomington, IN; stock #27391)
was co-expressed, resulting in the genotypes: OK371>Gal4, UAS-CD8-RFP/
UAS-TDP-43 WT or OK371>Gal4, UAS-CD8-RFP/ UAS-TDP-43 M337V,
OK371>Gal4, UAS-CD8-RFP/UAS-TDP-43 A315T, and negative control-
OK371>Gal4, UAS-CD8-RFP/+. OK371-Gal4 driver was used for all Drosophila transgene expression except for the TBPH rescue
cross where Armadillo Gal4 was used. In TBPH viability rescue cross, transgenes
(UAS-Venus-TBPH, UAS-Venus-TDP-43, and UAS-Venus-TDP43 M337V) were expressed by
Armadillo Gal4 in TBPH Δ23 homozygote mutants. Controls in this analysis
included W1118, homozygotes and heterozygotes for the null TBPH Δ23
mutation. Third instar larvae were sorted by genotype and placed in separate
vials. The percentage of larvae that became living adults was recorded and
graphed.

Primary mouse cortical neuron culture and transfection were conducted as
previously described ( Kaech and Banker,
2006 ). Details are provided in supplemental methods .

Imaging cortical neurons was done 5-8 days after plating, and human
motor neurons 2-17 days after plating. For in vivo live
imaging, wandering 3 rd instar Drosophila larvae were
dissected live in HL3 medium ( Stewart et al.,
1994 ); pinned to Sylgard in an imaging chamber; eviscerated keeping
CNS, nerves and muscle intact; and covered with a coverslip. Time-lapse movies
were obtained using a spinning disc confocal Marianas system (Intelligent
Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) configured on a Zeiss Axio Observer. Further
details can be found in supplemental methods .

In live Drosophila larvae samples, images of the NMJ at
muscle 13 were examined for levels of Venus-TDP-43 fluorescence. Time-lapse
movies were analyzed using SlideBook 5.5 or Imaris 7.6 (Bitplane Science
Software, South Windsor, CT) with the manual particle-tracking module. Granules
that moved >3 μm during the length of the movie were analyzed. In
mouse cortical neurons, when granules changed direction, they were considered a
new particle. However, in the moving vs. stationary analysis, granules changing
direction were counted as 1 moving particle.

For live-cell imaging of mitochondria, cells transfected with
fluorescent TDP-43 (wild-type or mutant) were incubated for 20 min in imaging
media containing either Mitotracker Red FM (25 nM; Invitrogen), or Mitotracker
Green FM (20 nM; Invitrogen). The cells were then imaged using live fluorescent
confocal microscopy as described above.

FLAG-tagged expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells
using Fugene 6 as recommended by manufacturer. Mock-transfected cells were used
as negative control, and a 10 cm plate was used for each co-immunoprecipitation.
48 hrs later, cells were lysed and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
21,000g. Clarified lysates were pre-cleared with normal mouse IgG agarose and
protein G agarose prior to co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma)
agarose. Beads were washed and immmunopurified proteins were eluted with FLAG
peptide (Sigma). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to protein
identification by mass spectrometry. Where indicated, 45μg RNAse A was
added to each lysate prior to co-immunoprecipitation.

To study the interaction between Stau1 and TDP-43, samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE using AnyKD tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to
PVDF membrane. To detect expression levels of TDP-43, 3 Drosophila 3 rd instar larvae brains were
collected, homogenized, and reduced per lane. These samples were separated by
SDS-PAGE using Novex NuPAGE Bis-Tris (Life Technologies) gels. Anti-TDP43 (Santa
Cruz, sc-100871) and anti-STAU1 (ProteinTech, 14225-1-AP) were used.

Beacon loop sequences of 23-25nt were designed manually to detect the
mouse or human NFL transcript using 3 different programs in parallel; 1)
OLIGOWALK, 2) mFold, and 3) MicroInspector. Using this approach, beacons were
predicted to stably hybridize to single stranded regions of the transcript in
areas not bound by endogenous microRNAs ( Bratu et
al., 2003 ; Rusinov et al.,
2005 ). Beacons were synthesized using a nuclease resistant
2`-O-methylribonucleotide backbone and were prevented from nuclear localization
by conjugation to NeutrAvidin ( Chen et al.,
2009 ; Chen et al., 2010 ).
Beacons were synthesized with a biotin-modified-dT nucleotide in the 3`stem
sequence and were labeled with 5` Cy3 and 3` BHQ2 by Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). The beacon sequences are: Nefl 5`- Cy3 GCTCA ATCTTTCTTCTTAGCCACC (Bio-dt)gagc BHQ2-3`, NEFL 5`- Cy3 cacaG GTTCAATCTTTCTTCTTAGCTG C(Bio-dT)gtg BHQ2 -3`. Underlined sequences form the self-hybridizing stem sequence and upper
case letters hybridize to the transcript. Nefl beacon
hybridization to its target sequence was tested in vitro using
synthetic oligonucleotides in solution. Nefl beacon hybridized
rapidly with its target and high specific fluorescence was detected. Further
details are provided in supplemental material .

Novel iPS cell lines were characterized in this study:
TDP-43 A315T and TDP-43 G298S . Dermal biopsies were
obtained from 2 familial ALS patients with mutations in the TARDBP locus. From these explants, fibroblasts were
generated and expanded in KO-DMEM (Life Technologies™) supplemented with
10% FBS (Hyclone™). TDP-43 iPS cells were derived by transduction of
fibroblasts with retroviruses expressing OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 . After 3-4 weeks, primary iPS cell colonies were
picked based on morphology and independently expanded in mTeSR™1 medium
(STEMCELL Technologies) to generate 4-6 different iPS cell lines/patient. The
presence of the mutations was confirmed by PCR amplification of a genomic region
surrounding Exon 6, followed by Sanger DNA sequencing. The
pluripotency of the iPS cell lines used was validated using the TaqMan®
hPSC Scorecard™ Panel (Life Technologies™). Expression of
transcription factors and cell surface antigens characteristic of the
pluripotent state was confirmed using immunocytochemistry. Primary antibodies
and dilution factors used for this purpose were NANOG (1:100, R&D), OCT3/4
(1:500, Santa Cruz), SSEA-4 (1:1000, Santa Cruz) and TRA-1-81 (1:1000,
Millipore).

Detailed description can be found in the Supplemental Materials section. Briefly, iPS cells were maintained on a monolayer of neomycin selected
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Millipore) in hiPS media ( Bilican et al., 2012 ; Dimos et al., 2008 ). To generate motor neurons,
undifferentiated iPS cells were incubated with 10 μM Y27632 (Calbiochem)
then passaged, triturated, and placed into ultra-low adherent culture dishes
(Corning) for seeding of embryoid bodies (EBs). For the first 11 days, cells
were kept in suspension in hiPS media without bFGF. At day 11, EBs were switched
to neural induction medium. At day 28, EBs were dissociated, transfected using
Lonza Nucleofector with mRNA beacons and HB9 (9Kb)-promoter-GFP, and plated onto
PDL/laminin-coated (BD Biosciences) glass ( Kaech
and Banker, 2006 ). To prepare the cells for live imaging, cells were
allowed to settle on glass coverslips flipped over primary glial monolayers.

Statistical analyses were performed with Prism6 (GraphPad Software Inc.,
La Jolla, CA). Comparing the TDP-43 wild-type to TDP-43 (M337V) datasets yielded
all p-values. A Mann-Whitney unpaired test with one-tailed p-value was completed
for comparing distances travelled, velocity analysis, and the directional
percentages of granules within populations. A One-Way Anova test followed by a
Tukey test was completed for the TBPH rescue analysis. KaleidaGraph (Synergy
software) was used to make the axonal particle trafficking distance and velocity
bar graphs. All error bars are shown as mean ± SEM.
