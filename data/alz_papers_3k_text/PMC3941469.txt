# Title
IL-34 is a tissue-restricted ligand of CSF1R required for the development of Langerhans cells and microglia

# Abstract
The differentiation of bone marrow–derived progenitors into monocytes, tissue macrophages and some dendritic cell (DC) subtypes requires the growth factor CSF1 and its receptor, CSF1R. Langerhans cells (LCs) and microglia develop from embryonic myeloid precursors that populate the epidermis and central nervous system (CNS) before birth. Notably, LCs and microglia are present in CSF1-deficient mice but absent from CSF1R-deficient mice. Here we investigated whether an alternative CSF1R ligand, interleukin 34 (IL-34), is responsible for this discrepancy. Through the use of IL-34-deficient ( Il34 LacZ/LacZ ) reporter mice, we found that keratinocytes and neurons were the main sources of IL-34. Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice selectively lacked LCs and microglia and responded poorly to skin antigens and viral infection of the CNS. Thus, IL-34 specifically directs differentiation of myeloid cells in the skin epidermis and CNS.

## INTRUCTION
The mononuclear phagocyte system encompasses a group of myeloid cells with crucial functions in maintaining the homeostasis of multiple tissues as well as promoting inflammatory and repair responses to microbial, chemical and physical insults 1 – 5 . The development of many mononuclear phagocytes, including blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, requires colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1; also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 6 , 7 . CSF1 binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor CSF1R (also known as M-CSFR or CD115) on bone marrow progenitors, which results in their proliferation and differentiation into monocytes and macrophages. The CSF-1–CSF1R ligand-receptor pair also promotes the differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts 8 , which are created by the fusion of mononuclear myeloid progenitors and participate in the resorption and remodeling of bone. Moreover, signaling via CSF1R contributes to the development of two dendritic cell (DC) subsets: Langerhans cells (LCs), which are the resident DCs of the epidermis; and monocyte-derived DCs, which constitute a major DC population in inflamed tissues 1 – 5 , 9 .

Although monocytes, tissue macrophages, osteoclasts, monocyte-derived DCs and LCs express CSF1R, their dependence on CSF1 varies considerably 10 . This heterogeneity is reflected in the disparate phenotypes of osteopetrotic mutant mice that lack CSF1 because of an inactivating mutation (op/op) in the gene encoding CSF1 ( Csf1 op/op mice) 11 and mice deficient in CSF1R ( Csf1r −/− mice) 12 . Both Csf1 op/op and Csf1r −/− mice lack osteoclasts and thus are osteopetrotic. However, Csf1r −/− mice have more severe defects in several mononuclear phagocyte subsets than are Csf1 op/op mice. Notably, microglia, which are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) 13 , are present in Csf1 op/op mice but absent from Csf1r −/− mice 14 , 15 . Similarly, LCs are present in Csf1 op/op mice but absent from Csf1r −/− mice 14 , 16 . Such discrepancies suggest the existence of an alternative ligand for CSF1R that can partially compensate for the absence of CSF1 in Csf1 op/op mice. Relevant to this, interleukin 34 (IL-34) has been identified as the second functional ligand for CSF1R 17 , 18 . IL-34 shares little aminoacid homology with CSF1 but can bind to and activate CSF1R, at least in vitro 19 , 20 . Furthermore, transgenic expression of IL-34 ‘rescues’ the bone, osteoclast and tissue macrophage defects of Csf1 op/op mice 19 . Although IL-34 can compensate for the lack of CSF1, the expression patterns of Il34 mRNA and Csf1 mRNA are spatially and temporally distinct 19 , which suggests that they have complementary rather than redundant roles in CSF1R activation in vivo .

In this study, we generated IL-34-deficient reporter mice in which the Il34 coding sequence was replaced by the gene encoding β-galactosidase ( Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice). Analysis of these mice showed that IL-34 was produced mainly by keratinocytes and neurons. Consistent with that distribution pattern, we found that Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had a selective defect in the generation of LCs and microglia. The lack of LCs resulted in diminished contact hypersensitivity (CHS), whereas the deficiency in microglia resulted in greater susceptibility to viral infection of the CNS. In contrast to its effect on LCs and microglia, targeted deletion of Il34 had little effect on other myeloid-cell compartments, except for slightly fewer CD11b + DCs in the lung. Blood monocytes, other tissue macrophages and DC subsets were largely unaffected, reflective of the predominant role of other growth factors, such as CSF1 and Flt3, for their maturation.

LCs and microglia are unique among myeloid cells in their development; they arise from embryonic myeloid progenitors that populate the skin and the CNS, respectively, before birth. LCs and microglia proliferate before birth and during the first days of postnatal life and then self-renew with a slow turnover rate 13 , 16 , 21 – 23 . Our results show that IL-34 promotes a tissue-specific differentiation pathway that is selectively required for myeloid cells that populate the epidermis and CNS.

## RESULTS
We generated IL-34-mutant mice from a genetically targeted embryonic stem cell line designed to create a null, lacZ reporter allele by Cre-mediated deletion ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We bred mice carrying the targeted Il34 gene to transgenic mice expressing Cre driven bya ubiquitous cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-Cre) to produce Il34 LacZ/+ mice in which exons 3–5 were deleted and replaced by an internal ribosome entry site– lacZ cassette. We intercrossed offspring to generate homozygous Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice. To identify β-galactosidase (LacZ)-producing cells, we stained frozen tissue sections of Il34 LacZ/+ mice with the β-galactosidase substrate X-gal. We found strong and punctate X-gal staining in the skin, brain, kidney and testes ( Fig. 1 ). At the cellular level, X-gal staining was evident in keratinocytes, hair follicles, neurons, proximal renal tubule cells and seminiferous tubule germ cells. In the brain, we detected X-gal staining in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum ( Supplementary Fig. 2a–d ). We did not find X-gal staining in the meninges, but it was present in a fraction of ependymal cells lining the ventricular system and those of the choroid plexus ( Supplementary Fig. 2a–d ), which suggested that IL-34 was secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. X-gal staining was weak or undetectable in other nonlymphoid organs as well as spleen and lymph nodes ( Fig. 1 and data not shown). X-gal staining in the CNS and skin substantially overlapped the pattern of Il34 mRNA expression in the Biology Gene Portal System (BioGPS) microarray data set ( http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=76527 ) and its expression reported before 19 . In contrast, X-gal staining did not overlap the pattern of Csf1 mRNA expression ( http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=12977 ), except in bones. These data indicated a nonredundant function for IL-34 in the CNS and skin, but a possibly redundant or dispensable role for IL-34 in other tissues in which CSF-1 is produced. Il34 mRNA was almost undetectable in skin and brain of homozygous Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2e, f ), which confirmed that Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice completely lacked IL-34.

Because we found that keratinocytes produced IL-34 ( Fig. 1a ), and LC development depends on CSF1R but not CSF1 (ref. 16 ), we hypothesized that IL-34 may be essential for the development of LCs. To test our hypothesis, we isolated cells from the ears of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and analyzed their content of LCs and dermal DCs by flow cytometry. We identified LCs as CD11c + major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) + cells that express CD207 (langerin) but not CD103, which is a marker of some dermal DCs 2 – 4 , 22 . We categorized dermal DCs into two subsets. A larger subset included CD11c + MHCII + cells that lacked CD103 and CD207 (refs. 2 – 4 , 22 ). These cells also expressed the common myeloid marker CD11b (data not shown). A smaller subset included CD11c + MHCII + cells that expressed both CD103 and CD207 (refs. 24 – 28 ). We found considerably fewer CD11c + MHCII + CD103 − CD207 + LCs in the skin of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than in the skin of wild-type mice ( Fig. 2a, b ). In contrast, CD103 + CD207 + and CD103 − CD207 − dermal DCs were equally abundant in Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice ( Fig. 2a, b ).

To confirm the defect in LCs and the maintenance of dermal DCs in the skin of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice, we isolated epidermal sheets from the ears of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and looked for LCs identified as CD11c + and MHCII + cells. The epidermis of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had considerably fewer CD11c + MHCII + cells than did the epidermis of wild-type mice, as shown by both confocal microscopy ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, b ) and flow cytometry ( Supplementary Fig. 3c, d ). We also examined dermal DCs, identified as CD11c + MHCII + cells in the dermal sheets of the ears. Wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had a similar frequency of dermal CD11c + MHCII + cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3e, f ). Dermal DC subsets, identified as CD103 − CD11b + and CD103 + CD11b − cells, were present in equal abundance in wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice ( Supplementary Fig. 3g–j ). We also evaluated LCs and dermal DCs in the body-wall skin by assessing the expression of CD207, MHCII and CD11b by immunohistochemistry. Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had almost no cells that expressed CD207, MHCII and CD11b in the epidermis, whereas these cells were present in the dermis ( Fig. 2c–e ). Wild-type mice had cells that expressed CD207, MHCII and CD11b in both the epidermis and dermis.

Because LCs migrate from the skin to the lymph nodes 4 , 22 , we analyzed skin-draining lymph nodes by flow cytometry. To distinguish among DC subsets, we costained lymph node cells for CD11c and MHCII ( Fig. 2f–h ). CD11c + MHCII hi cells (gate I) include migrating DCs; CD11c + MHCII int cells (gate II) include CD8α + DCs; CD11c + MHCII lo cells (gate III) include plasmacytoid DCs. To further distinguish between LCs and dermal DCs, we also stained cells for CD103 and CD207, as described above. We noted considerably fewer migrating CD103 − CD207 + LCs in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than in wild-type mice ( Fig. 2f–h ). In contrast, migrating dermal DCs, including CD103 + CD207 + and CD103 − CD207 − CD11b + subsets, were present in equal abundance in the lymph nodes of Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice ( Fig. 2f–h ). IL-34 deficiency had no effect on lymph node CD8α + DCs or Siglec-H + plasmacytoid DCs ( Fig. 2f ). Immunohistochemical analysis of lymph nodes showed considerably fewer CD207 cells in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than in wild-type mice ( Fig. 2i ). Although some dermal DCs also express CD207 (refs. 24 – 28 ), the flow cytometry analysis indicated that the lower abundance of CD207 + cells in the lymph nodes solely reflected a lower abundance of migrating epidermal LCs. Moreover, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and wild-type mice had similar numbers of CD207 + cells in the spleen and thymus ( Supplementary Fig. 3k ), consistent with the idea that these cells are not derived from epidermal LCs 24 , 25 .

LCs are antigen-presenting cells of the epidermis 29 that prime T cell responses to skin allergens 30 – 33 . Given that, we assessed the effect of IL-34 and LC deficiency on CHS. We sensitized wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice to the hapten DNFB by cutaneous application of DNFB to the shaved abdomen on day 0. After 5 d, we challenged mice by painting the left ear with DNFB and the right ear with vehicle only, as a control. We calculated ear swelling for each mouse by subtracting the thickness of the vehicle-treated ear from that of the DNFB-treated ear. Ear swelling in wild-type mice peaked between days 1 and 2 after challenge and decreased at day 3 ( Fig. 3a ). At all times after challenge, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice were less sensitive than were wild-type mice to DNFB-mediated CHS.

Because LCs deliver skin antigens to draining lymph nodes 34 , we assessed whether the diminished CHS in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice depended on defective antigen delivery. We painted the ears of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice with the dye CellTracker Green and monitored CellTracker + cells in the draining cervical lymph nodes 40–48 h later. To distinguish between skin-derived DCs and resident DCs, we costained lymph node cells for CD40 and CD11c 35 . The frequency of CellTracker + cells among CD40 hi CD11c hi DCs was much lower in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than wild-type mice ( Fig. 3b , population II), which suggested that CD40 hi CD11c hi DCs included migrating LCs. In contrast, the frequency of CellTracker + cells among CD40 int CD11c int cells was similar in the draining lymph nodes of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice ( Fig. 3b , population I), which suggested that the CD40 int CD11c int cells corresponded to migrating dermal DCs. Resident DCs, identified as CD40 lo CD11c hi , were negative for CellTracker ( Fig. 3b , population III) and were present in equal abundance in wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice. Thus, deficiency of IL-34 resulted in selectively fewer CellTracker + cells of epidermal origin in the draining lymph nodes. To confirm those results, we evaluated migrating LCs and dermal DCs in the lymph nodes after painting with CellTracker Green, using CD207 and CD103 as markers. The draining lymph nodes of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had considerably fewer CellTracker + CD207 + CD103 − LCs than did those of wild-type mice, whereas we observed a similar proportion of CellTracker + CD207 + CD103 + dermal DCs in Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice ( Fig. 3c ).

CD8 + and CD4 + T cells that produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mediate CHS to DNFB 36 . Thus, we examined the effect of deficiency in IL-34 and LCs on the priming of T cells in draining lymph nodes after sensitization with DNFB. We collected inguinal lymph nodes 6 d after sensitizing mice with DNFB, then stimulated the lymph nodes with plate-bound antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) and assessed IFN-γ production 24 and 48 h later. Lymph node cells from Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice produced less IFN-γ than did cells isolated from wild-type mice ( Fig. 3d ). Lower IFN-γ production was paralleled with fewer total cells in the lymph nodes of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than in the lymph nodes of wild-type mice, consistent with the lower inflammation ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). The lack of IL-34, however, had no effect on the normal development of CD8 + or CD4 + T cells in the thymus or the number of CD8 + or CD4 + T cells in lymph nodes of naive mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Together these results demonstrated that the paucity of epidermal LCs due to lack of IL-34 impaired antigen delivery and priming of allergen-specific T cells in local draining lymph nodes.

It has been shown that LCs are necessary and sufficient for direct antigen presentation and the generation of an antigen-specific response by the T H 17 subset of helper T cells in a model of infection of the skin with Candida albicans 37 . To see whether IL-34 and LC deficiency affected the skin response to C. albicans , we sensitized Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice by applying C. albicans to shaved dorsal skin. One week after sensitization, we challenged mice with C. albicans in the footpad and measured swelling the next day. Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had modestly but significantly ( P = 0.0237) less swelling than did wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). We found fewer cells in the draining lymph nodes of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than in those of wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ), which provided further evidence of an attenuated inflammatory skin response to C. albicans . This result confirmed the CHS data and indicated that the lack of LCs did have at least some effect on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to pathogens in the skin.

Because we found that neurons produced IL-34 ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a , c ) and microglia are present in Csf1 op/op mice but absent from Csf1r −/− mice 14 , 15 , we hypothesized that IL-34 contributes to the development of microglia. We purified myeloid cells from the brains of Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice with anti-CD11b magnetic beads and identified microglia (CD11b + CD45 int ) by flow cytometry 13 . The number of CD11b + CD45 int cells isolated from brains of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice was <20% of that in wild-type mice ( Fig. 4a ). Staining of CNS sections with IBA-1, a marker of myeloid cells, confirmed that the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus and basal ganglia of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had considerably fewer microglia than did those of wild-type mice ( Fig. 4b–e and Table 1 ). Notably, the cerebellum of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and wild-type mice had a similar abundance of microglia ( Fig. 4f and Table 1 ), perhaps because of local production of CSF1. We purified residual microglia of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and stimulated them in vitro with ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Purified microglia from Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice produced inflammatory cytokines in amounts similar to those produced by equal numbers of wild-type microglia ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ), which indicated that IL-34 deficiency affected mainly development but not the ability of microglia to produce inflammatory cytokines.

Microglia are thought to protect the CNS from viral infection through several mechanisms, including the production of cytokines that inhibit viral replication, the phagocytosis of virus-infected and dying neurons and the induction of neuronal repair and homeostasis 13 . We examined the effect of deficiency in IL-34 and microglia in vivo during infection with a neurotropic virus. We infected wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice with West Nile virus (WNV) via an intracranial route and monitored survival. Infection with wild-type virulent WNV resulted in rapid mortality in both Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice and wild-type mice, as 100% of both groups of mice succumbed to infection by 8 d after infection ( Fig. 5a ). In contrast, when we infected mice with an attenuated WNV strain (WNV-E218A), we observed more death of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice than of wild-type mice by 10–12 d after infection. This result suggested that a lack of IL-34 and consequent lower abundance of microglia impaired CNS defenses against WNV infection. Notably, we detected similar viral burdens in various regions of the brain of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice on both day 3 and day 6 after infection ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ), which suggested that the protective effect of microglia may have been due to their ability to limit neuronal death and/or promote CNS repair rather than their ability to directly inhibit viral replication.

To test that hypothesis, we assessed neuronal apoptosis in various regions of the brains of wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice on day 6 after infection by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) assay. Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had more neuronal apoptosis in all brain areas analyzed ( Fig. 5b–f ). Analysis of WNV-infected brains by flow cytometry showed that Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had fewer microglia than did wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Thus, although WNV infection causes inflammation and the recruitment of bone marrow–derived myeloid cells, such as inflammatory monocytes 38 , such recruitment was not sufficient to compensate for the defect in resident microglia in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice. WNV-infected Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice had a similar abundance of brain macrophages and total CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, as well as WNV-specific CD8 + T cells ( Supplementary 5c–e ), which further suggested that susceptibility of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice to WNV was due to insufficient resident microglia and a consequent lack of the protective and trophic factors provided by these cells.

In vitro studies have suggested that IL-34 can promote differentiation of bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) 19 . Furthermore, transgenic expression of IL-34 ‘rescues’ the bone, osteoclast and tissue macrophage defects of Csf1 op/op mice 19 . Whether IL-34 is necessary for the development of macrophages in vivo in tissues other than the skin and the brain remains unknown. To assess this, we examined whether IL-34 deficiency affected myeloid cell development in lymphoid organs. Notably, Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice had similar frequencies of CD11b + , F4/80 + , Ly6C + and Ly6G + cell subsets in the peripheral blood and bone marrow ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Analysis of DC subsets in the spleens of Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice also showed a similar frequency of CD8α + , CD11b + and CD4 + CD11c + DCs as well as Siglec-H + plasmacytoid DCs ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ).

We next assessed whether IL-34 deficiency also affected the development of tissue-resident macrophages in nonlymphoid organs. Kupffer cells are liver-resident macrophages 39 that include two subsets identified by expression of the macrophage marker F4/80 and CD11b 40 . The frequency of F4/80 + CD11b − and F4/80 + CD11b + Kupffer cells was similar in Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice ( Fig. 6a ). IL-34 deficiency also had no effect on lung alveolar macrophages, identified as CD11c + Siglec-F + F4/80 + cells ( Fig. 6b ), or total DCs, identified as CD11c + Siglec-F − cells ( Fig. 6c ). However, among lung DC subsets, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had fewer CD11c + CD11b + DCs ( Fig. 6b, c ). These results suggested a smaller effect of IL-34 on the development of macrophages and DCs than on the development of LCs and microglia, probably because of redundancy with CSF-1.

Microglia and LCs originate during embryogenesis from primitive precursors that populate the skin and CNS before birth. Precursor cell populations expand before and soon after birth. In the adults, microglia and LCs self-renew with a slow turnover rate under homeostatic conditions 13 , 16 , 21 – 23 . We sought to determine whether the defects in LCs and microglia observed in adult Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice was due to impaired development or maintenance in the adult once these cells developed. To address this, we examined microglia and LCs in neonates. Il34 LacZ/LacZ neonates had considerably fewer microglia than did wild-type neonates ( Fig. 7a, b ). Similarly, although they were present in wild-type neonates, LCs were absent from the skin of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice ( Fig. 7c, d ). Thus, IL-34 was crucial for the development of both cell subsets.

We next assessed whether IL-34 was necessary for the turnover of LCs during skin inflammation. It has been shown that after prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light, LCs rapidly disappear and are replaced by circulating monocytic precursors within 3 weeks 41 . We depleted wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice of LCs by exposing them to ultraviolet light and analyzed the epidermis of the ears 21 d after treatment. In wild-type mice, after the initial depletion caused by exposure to ultraviolet light ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ), LCs were partially replenished by day 21 ( Fig. 7e, f ). Notably, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice, which lacked LCs before the treatment with ultraviolet light, had a detectable LC population at day 21 ( Fig. 7e, f ), which suggested that IL-34 was dispensable for the regeneration of LCs from monocytic progenitors in adult mice in response to inflammation.

## DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that IL-34 was produced mainly by keratinocytes and neurons and that a lack of this cytokine resulted in considerably fewer LCs in the epidermis and microglia in the CNS. These results explain the well-described difference in the phenotypes of Csf1 op/op mice and Csf1r −/− mice 12 : LCs and microglia are present in Csf1 op/op mice but absent from Csf1r −/− mice 14 – 16 . Thus, IL-34 selectively directs a developmental program specific for these unique subsets of myeloid cells. Both LCs and microglia develop from embryonic progenitors and populate their correspondent tissues during embryogenesis. There, they proliferate and differentiate before and soon after birth 15 , 16 , 21 . We envision that IL-34 stimulates the population expansion and/or differentiation of the LC and microglia progenitors once they reach the epidermis and CNS. Consistent with such a model, we found that Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice lacked LCs and microglia at birth. It is possible that IL-34 also contributes to the maintenance of LCs and microglia in the steady state in the adult. However, as Csf1 op/op mice have LCs at birth 12 but are deficient in LCs as adults 42 , CSF1 also may contribute to the self-renewal of LCs. Notably, we found IL-34 in ependymal cells of the choroid plexus, which suggests that it may promote the development of myeloid cells at this site, although DCs in the choroid plexus are dependent on the ligand for Flt3 (ref. 43 ).

After epidermal damage and inflammation, LCs are replaced rapidly by monocytic precursors 16 . Similarly, during CNS injury, bone marrow–derived progenitors infiltrate the CNS to promote inflammation and repair 38 , 44 . In these situations, the breakdown of the epidermis and altered brain-blood barrier probably facilitates the infiltration of bone marrow–derived myeloid progenitors and additional cellular sources of CSF1 that may contribute to the regeneration of LCs and microglia. In support of that model, we found that after ultraviolet light–induced inflammation, the defect of LCs in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice was partially compensated for by LCs presumably derived from monocytic precursors 41 . Although brain infection with an attenuated WNV virus did not lead to the complete replenishment of microglia by incoming monocytes, this may occur in mice infected with virulent strains that cause more severe inflammation.

In addition to finding IL-34 production in the epidermis and neurons, we detected IL-34 production in other tissue compartments, particularly the kidney and testis, but also in a scattered pattern in the spleen. Given those findings, it is likely that IL-34 also contributes to the development of myeloid cells in other anatomic regions. However, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice were fertile and lacked apparent renal deficiency. Moreover, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice had no apparent defects in blood monocytes, tissue macrophages or DCs, with the exception of fewer CD11c + CD11b + DCs in the lung. Thus, beyond the epidermis and CNS, cellular sources of CSF1 may compensate for an absence of IL-34. In some compartments, such as the skeletal system, CSF1 may act as the main agonist of CSF1R, as Csf1 op/op mice develop osteopetrosis despite producing normal amounts of IL-34.

Because they selectively lacked LCs and microglia, Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice provided a unique opportunity for assessing the function of these cells. LCs are antigen-presenting cells that intercalate with keratinocytes and establish tight contacts via E-cadherin-mediated adhesion 29 , 45 . Given the production of IL-34 by keratinocytes, such contacts may be essential for the differentiation and maintenance of LCs. LCs slowly detach from keratinocytes to cross the epidermal basement membrane and migrate into the draining lymph nodes and thus regulate skin-adaptive immune responses to physical injury, chemical allergens and infection 46 . Whether LCs elicit activation or tolerance of T cells in response to chemical allergens remains unclear 46 . One study has reported that mice with transgenic expression of the gene encoding diphtheria toxin under control of the human langerin promoter have constitutive deletion of LCs that results in enhanced CHS 47 , 48 . Thus, LCs seemed to have a tolerogenic function. However, conflicting results have been obtained with mice in which the gene encoding the receptor for diphtheria toxin is knocked into the langerin locus, so that LCs can be ablated conditionally by injection of diphtheria toxin. In these mice, deletion of LCs results in attenuated CHS 30 , 31 or has a negligible effect 34 , which suggests that LCs have either a stimulatory function or no influence on T cell responses. CHS was attenuated in our Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice relative to that in wild-type mice, which supports the proposal that LCs promote T cell stimulation, at least in response to a chemical hapten. The discrepancies among the studies may reflect differences in the extent and timing of LC defects as well as the type and amount of haptens and adjuvants used to induce CHS. Our study also showed that deficiency of IL-34 diminished the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to C. albicans , which supports the idea that LCs can promote the generation of T cell responses to pathogens 37 .

It was unexpected that the considerably lower abundance of microglia in Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice did not cause a substantially altered CNS phenotypes under steady-state conditions, although we did no detailed neurological testing. However, it is possible that loss of the neuroprotective functions of microglia may expedite neurodegenerative pathology 49 . Alternatively, microglia may have a role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development, which would influence brain plasticity 50 . Thus, it will be important in future studies to use IL-34-deficient mice to assess whether a lack of microglia induces functional changes in mouse behavior. The lack of microglia did negatively affect the survival of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice infected intracranially with an attenuated strain of WNV. However, microglia did not directly affect viral replication, as Il34 LacZ/LacZ and wild-type mice had similar viral burdens in many brain regions, which suggests that in these settings, microglia may act by preserving CNS integrity, presumably by removing virus-infected, dying cells, secreting neurotrophic factors and limiting neuronal injury and death 13 . In summary, our studies of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice have demonstrated an alternative pathway for the development of myeloid cells that is essential for LCs and microglia but redundant or dispensable for other myeloid-cell subsets. Functional analysis of Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice has defined an important role for LCs in promoting CHS and for microglia in protecting the CNS from injury associated with viral infection.

## METHODS
Of three clones carrying the targeted allele Il34 tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium), two were confirmed by Southern blot analysis as being correctly targeted and were introduced into C57BL/6J- Tyrc-2J /J (B6-albino) eight-cell embryos by laser-assisted injection. Male chimeras ( n = 18; most >80% derived from embryonic stem cells, as assessed by coat color) were obtained from clone EPD0146_4_D03 (embryonic stem line JM8.N4; C57BL/6). Chimeras were initially bred to B6-albino mice for analysis of germline transmission; those transmitting 100% were bred to CMV-Cre mice (>99% C57BL/6) 51 for deletion of exons 3–5 of Il34 and the neomycin-resistance cassette; Il34 LacZ/+ offspring were intercrossed to generate IL-34-null LacZ + mice ( Il34 LacZ/LacZ ). To delete the IRES-lacZ–neomycin-resistance cassette and generate mice carrying a lox P-flanked Il34 allele ( Il34 f/+ ), chimeras were also bred to CAG-FLPe C57BL/6 transgenic mice 2 , which express an enhanced form of the FLP recombinase driven by a chicken β-actin/rabbit β-globin hybrid promoter (AG) and the human CMV-IE enhancer. Il34 f/+ mice were intercrossed to generate Il34 f/f mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Homozygous Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice were used for analysis; wild-type controls were age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 or Il34 f/f mice bred in the same room of the facility. All animal studies were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Mice were genotyped by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: for Il34 LacZ/LacZ , Il34 305959 (5′-TCAGATACAAATATGAAATTAGAG-3′), Il34 306329 (5′-TGCTGGCAAAGGGCTAAGAA-3′) and Il34 306539 (5′-GTCAGTATCGGCGGAATT-3′; wild-type product, 421 base pairs (bp); Editor: this PCR is deisigned to distinguish 3 possibilites: the endogenous allele, the external lox P site (5′ on our map, but not relevant otherwise) that is present in both the intitial targeted allele and in the floxed allele (post FLP), and the LacZ reporter (post Cre, exons 3–5 deleted) allele; have tried to make this more clear] Il34 external LoxP product, 371 bp; Il34 LacZ reporter product, 581 bp); for Il34 f/f , Il34 307868 (5′-CCATGGTCAGAGTCCCCAGG-3′) and Il34 315341 (5′-CCCTGGTCGGCTTTGCATGT-3′; wild-type product, 468 bp; Il34 f product, 570 bp).

Sections for immunohistochemistry were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues or frozen tissues. For morphology, slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cryostat sections 5 μm in thickness were air-dried overnight, fixed in acetone for 10 min and stained by with a β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Staining Kit (Sigma). X-gal Stock Solution (Sigma) was prepared in N , N -dimethylformamide (Sigma). An X-gal working solution was prepared by dilution of the X-gal stock solution 1:40 in prewarmed dilution buffer. Slides were washed for 5 min at 25 °C in 1× PBS (Sigma) with three changes of the solution and were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in X-gal working solution, in a humidified chamber. Sections were rinsed in 1× PBS (twice for 5 min each) and in distilled water (5 min). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin or fast red. The β-galactosidase activity was visualized as a light blue signal. Sections (4 μm in thickness) from fixed tissues were stained with anti-IBA1 (rabbit; 1:300 dilution; Cat. No. 019-19741; Wako Chemicals) and reactivity was detected with an EnVision HRP-linked Rabbit kit (Dako) followed by diaminobenzidine. Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin. Cryostat sections (5 μm in thickness) from frozen tissues were stained with rat monoclonal antibody to langerin (1:100 dilution; 929F3.01; Dendritics), F4/80 (1:50 dilution; BM8; Caltag Laboratories), CD11b (1:100 dilution; M1/70; BD Pharmingen) or MHC class II I-A and I-E (1:50 dilution; 2G9; BD Pharmingen). Reactivity was detected with a Rat-on-mouse HRP-Polymer Kit (Biocare Medical) followed by diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. For microphotographs, immunostained sections were photographed with a DP-70 Olympus camera mounted on an Olympus BX60 microscope. Microglia in wild-type and mutant mice were quantified by staining with anti-IBA-1 (Cat. No. 019-19741; Wako Chemicals) in paired regions of the brain. At least 25 high-power-fields (magnification, ×400) per region were analyzed for each mouse with a Nikon Eclipse 50i. Freshly isolated epidermal sheets were fixed and rehydrated and the receptor FcγR was blocked with monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 (ATCC). Epidermal sheets were stained with biotin-conjugated antibody to MHC class II (M5/114.15.2; BD Pharmingen) followed by streptavidin–Texas Red before being mounted on slides and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. At least eight high-power fields (magnification, ×400) per dermal sheet were analyzed. After infection with WNV, brains were collected and perfused sequentially with 20 ml PBS and 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, then fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded, then frozen sections were cut. Tissues were prepared and stained as described 3 . After saturation of nonspecific binding sites and permeabilization of cells, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MAP2 (AP-20Chemicon). Primary antibodies were detected with secondary Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat. No. A11017Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counterstained with To-Pro3 (Molecular Probes). TUNEL staining was done with an in situ cell death detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche), with some modifications 53 , 54 . Fluorescence staining was visualized and quantified with a Zeiss 510 Meta LSM confocal microscope.

RNA was extracted from skin and brain with an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). After cDNA was synthesized from RNA with the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), RNA expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and an ABI7000 (Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. IL-34 expression was detected with oligonucleotides that specifically amplify a 171-bp fragment from cDNA encoding exon 6 (forward primer, 5′-TACAGCCACCTCTGCTTGTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCAAGATACGGCATTTGGTT-3′).

Epidermal sheets were separated by treatment of mouse ears for 1 h at 37 °C with Dispase I (Sigma) at a concentration of 2 U/ml. For single-cell suspensions, epidermis or dermis was minced into fine pieces and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in collagenase IV (4830 U/ml; Sigma) and DNAse I (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma). Kupffer cells were isolated as described 55 . Livers were minced and then treated for 1 h at 37 °C with collagenase D (100 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells in single-cell suspension were spun through 33.8% Percoll (Sigma) for 12 min at 693 g . Red blood cells in recovered cell pellets were removed with red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma) before analysis. Lung cells were extracted after digestion of minced lungs for 1 h at 37 °C with DNAse I (50 U/ml), hyaluronidase (100 U/ml, Sigma) and liberase (0.28 U/ml; Roche). For microglia purification, brains were minced into fine pieces and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml collagenase D. For microglia purification, brains were minced into fine pieces and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml collagenase D. Cells were dissociated into single-cell suspensions by a combination of pipetting and vortexing and were then spun through 50% percoll (Sigma) for 45 min at 200 g . Microglia were identified as CD11b + CD45 int by flow cytometry. In some experiments, microglia were further enriched to a purity of over 95% with CD11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) and were stimulated with various TLR ligands (Invivogen) in vitro at the appropriate concentration. DCs from spleens and lymph nodes were dissociated into single-cell suspensions by incubation for 60 min with 100 μg/ml collagenase D before red blood cell lysis. In some experiment, DCs were further purified with CD11c magnetic beads (Miltenyi).

Wild-type WNV and WNV strain E218A were generated from an infectious cDNA clone of the New York 1999 strain and were propagated in C6/36 Aedes albopictus or BHK21-15 baby hamster kidney cells as described 56 , 57 . Vero African green monkey cells were used for measurement of viral titers of infected tissues by focus-forming assay 58 . Sex- and age-matched wild-type and Il34 LacZ/LacZ mice 8–10 weeks of age were inoculated by intracranial injection with specified doses of WNV diluted in Hank’s balanced-salt solution supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS (1 × 10 5 PFU in 10 μl). On specific days after infection, mice were killed and extensively perfused with iced PBS; organs were collected, weighed and processed for analysis of infiltrating CNS lymphocytes by a published protocol 53 or were stored at −80 °C until further processing. Alternatively, survival of groups of mice was monitored for 21 d after infection.

The migration of DCs and LCs was asssessed by painting of mouse ears with 100 μl 0.5% CellTracker Green (invitrogen) in acetone and dibutylphthalate (1:1) at 40–48 h before collection of cervical lymph nodes. CHS was induced in mice as described 59 . Mice were sensitized on day 0 by topical application, on the shaved abdomen, of 25 μl of 0.5% DNFB (2,4 dinitroflurobenzene; Sigma) in a mixture of acetone and olive oil (4:1). On day 5, mice were challenged with 10 μl of 0.2% DNFB on the left ear and 10 μl of vehicle on the right ear. Ear swelling was measured with an engineer’s micrometer (Fowler) 24 h after challenge. T cell priming during CHS was assessed as described 60 . Mice were sensitized by two daily paintings (days 0 and 1), on the shaved abdomen, of 25 μl of 0.5% DNFB. Inguinal lymph node cells from sensitized and control mice were cultured for 2 d in the presence of plate bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml; eBio500A2; eBioscience). IFN-γ in the supernatant was measured by cytometric bead array with a mouse inflammation kit (BD Bioscience). Induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity by C. albicans has been described 61 . Mice were shaved and chemically depilated with Nair hair remover. The stratum corneum was removed with 15 strokes with 220-grit sandpaper (3M). C. albicans was grown at 30 °C in yeast-peptone-adenine-dextrose medium until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.5–2.0. C. albicans (2 × 10 8 in 50 μl sterile PBS) was applied on to the skin. At 8 d after skin infection, mice were challenged with footpad injection of 1 × 10 7 heat-killed C. albicans . The specific delayed-type hypersensitivity was determined on the basis of the degree of footpad swelling 24 h after challenge. Treatment with ultraviolet light was done as described 16 .

DCs and other cell types in single-cell suspensions were incubated with supernatant of the hybridoma HB-197 (American Type Culture COllection) for blockade of Fc receptors and stained with anti-CD3 (145-2c11), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8α (53–6.7), anti-CD44 (IM7), anti-Ly6C (AL-21), anti-MHC-II (I-A/I-E, 2G9 or M5/114.15.2), anti-Siglec-F (E50-2440), anti-CD11b (M1/70; all from BD Pharmingen); anti-Ly6G (1A8), anti-CD62L (MEL-14), anti-Siglec-H (551; all from Biolegend); anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-CD103 (2E7; all from eBioscience); and anti body to the H-2D b –NS4B tetramer (US National Institutes of Health tetramer core facility). For intracellular staining with anti-CD207 (L31; eBioscience) and anti–granzyme B (GB12; Invitrogen), surfaces of cells were stained, then cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Bioscience). Cells were processed on a FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).

GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software) was used for all statistics analyses.
