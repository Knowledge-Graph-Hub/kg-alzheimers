Conformational Changes Induced by the A21G Flemish Mutation in the Amyloid Precursor Protein Lead to Increased Aβ Production

# Abstract
Proteolysis of the β C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein generates the Aβ peptides associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Familial mutations in the β-CTF, such as the A21G Flemish mutation, can increase Aβ secretion. We establish how the Flemish mutation alters the structure of C55, the first 55-residues of the β-CTF, using FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the A21G mutation reduces β-sheet structure of C55 from Leu17 to Ala21, an inhibitory region near the site of the mutation, and increases α-helical structure from Gly25 to Gly29, in a region near the membrane surface and thought to interact with cholesterol. Cholesterol also increases Aβ peptide secretion, and we show that the incorporation of cholesterol into model membranes enhances the structural changes induced by the Flemish mutant suggesting a common link between familial mutations and the cellular environment.

## Results
We first confirm that the A21G mutation results in an increase in Aβ production and then address whether mutations within the upstream LVFF sequence result in comparable changes in processing. Measurements were made using C55 and the β-CTF expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Measurements on full length APP are shown in Fig. S1 .

Secreted Aβ peptides (Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42) were measured after transfection by multiplex electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) assays. Proteolysis of the WT β-CTF results predominantly in the Aβ40 peptide (85%), with smaller amounts of Aβ38 (10%) and Aβ42 (5%). Fig. 1B shows the level of secreted Aβ peptides produced by γ-secretase cleavage as a percentage relative to WT. Both the A21G mutation and the LVFF to AAAA mutation increase total Aβ production. The A21G mutation results in a 1.7-fold increase in Aβ40. A larger increase (4.5-fold) is observed in Aβ40 for the LVFF to AAAA mutation. There is a striking increase (4-fold) in Aβ42 produced relative to WT in the A21G mutant. In contrast to the increase of Aβ40 and Aβ42 with the A21G and LVFF/AAAA mutations, the level of Aβ38 increases for the A21G but not LVFF/AAAA mutation.

We further compared the influence of the A21G and LVFF-to-AAAA mutations using C55. Several shorter versions of the β-CTF have previously been shown to function as γ-secretase substrates ( Funamoto et al., 2004 ; Yin et al., 2007 ). C55 is the C-terminal truncated version of C99, and includes the extracellular and TM regions of the protein. In our structural studies, we used C55 rather than the full-length C99 protein to allow selective incorporation of 13 C probes for structural studies. In Fig. 1C , we show that both the A21G and the LVFF to AAAA mutations increase Aβ secretion. The changes in Aβ secretion using C55 are similar to those using the full β-CTF, supporting its use as a model γ-secretase substrate.

The processing results show that the extracellular A21G mutation strongly promotes Aβ production with both C55 and C99. To address whether there are structural differences between WT C55 and C55 with extracellular mutations, we measured the global secondary structure of C55 reconstituted into model membrane bilayers using FTIR spectroscopy.

The amide I vibration (1600 – 1700 cm −1 ) is a sensitive marker of secondary structure. Fig. 2A presents the amide I region of WT C55 in dimyristoyl-phosphocholine (DMPC): dimyristoylphosphoglycerol (DMPG) bilayers. The FTIR spectrum exhibits both an intense band at 1657 cm −1 corresponding to α-helical structure and a weaker band at 1626 cm −1 corresponding to β-strand or β-sheet structure. Comparison of the FTIR spectrum of C55 with that of a TM peptide having a truncated extracellular domain ( Sato et al., 2009 ) argues that the 1626 cm −1 band arises from the extracellular region of C55 ( Fig. S2 ). To determine which residues are responsible for the 1626 cm −1 band, we mutated the KLVFF and EDV sequences that bracket A21. Mutations of K16 and F19-F20 reduce the 1626 cm −1 intensity consistent with a disruption or reduction of the β-strand secondary structure ( Fig. 2 ). In contrast, the mutation of the E22-D23-V24 sequence does not strongly influence the 1626 cm −1 intensity. These results argue that the extracellular region upstream of A21 folds into β-structure. Comparable results are obtained from FTIR studies on the full-length β-CTF in the wild-type, A21G and LVFF mutant ( Fig. 3 ).

Integration of the 1626 cm −1 peak suggests the β-sheet structure is formed by ~6-8 residues suggesting that several additional residues may be involved in β-sheet formation. The small 1695 cm −1 resonance observed for WT C55 is often associated with anti-parallel β-sheet ( Paul et al., 2004 ), and the loss of this peak upon mutation of the LVFF sequence suggests that this region adopts an anti-parallel β-sheet fold. One possibility is that the KLVFFAE sequence forms anti-parallel β-sheet through intermolecular interactions. Additional experiments are in progress to test this possibility, as well as the alternative that residues in the region N-terminal to KLVFF fold back and form β-sheet through intramolecular interactions.

Earlier solution NMR studies of the full β-CTF and shorter fragments show helical structure of the LVFF sequence ( Beel et al., 2008 ; Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ). Our observation of β-structure within the LVFF sequence argues that this region adopts a different secondary structure in membrane bilayers than in detergent/lipid mixtures and detergent micelles ( Beel et al., 2008 ; Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ). To test whether detergent interactions induce helical secondary, we compared FTIR spectra of C55 in membrane bilayers, detergent micelles and in bicelles that have been titrated from bilayer-like structures (q=2.0) to isotropic detergent-like structures (q=0.2) ( Fig. S3 ). Both the titration of bicelles toward a more detergent-like environment or direct comparisons of C55 in bilayers and detergent micelles show a loss of β-sheet structure characterized by the 1626 cm −1 amide I vibration with added detergent.

The A21G mutation has only a slight influence on the position of the 1626 cm −1 band observed in the FTIR spectrum of C55 ( Fig. 2B ). To further explore whether there are local changes in structure, we compared FTIR spectra of WT and A21G C55 peptides containing specific 13 C labels at backbone C=O positions within the LVFF sequence. The 13 C=O labels shift the amide vibration to lower frequencies. The frequency and intensity of the shifted resonances are sensitive to whether the 13 C=O labeled sites fall within parallel or antiparallel β-sheet structure ( Paul et al., 2004 ; Petty and Decatur, 2005 ). We selected F19 and F20 for labeling since mutations at these positions have a large influence on the 1626 cm −1 resonance. For WT C55 ( Figs. 4A, C ), the incorporation of 13 C leads to splitting of the 1626 cm −1 band into two components at 1608 cm −1 and 1630 cm −1 . These shifts are similar to those described for the KLVFFAED octapeptide ( Fig. S4 ), which forms fibrils with β-strands in an antiparallel orientation ( Balbach et al., 2000 ). In contrast, 13 C-labeling does not cause the β-sheet peak to split in the A21G mutant ( Figs. 4B and D ) suggesting that the anti-parallel structure observed at positions F19 and F20 has been disrupted or altered. Previous studies have shown that the extent of splitting and intensity is dependent on the position of the 13 C=O label. For example, Axelsen and colleagues ( Paul et al., 2004 ) found that C=O groups at the edge of β-sheet and not involved in hydrogen bonds had higher frequencies and reduced intensity compared to hydrogen bonded C=O groups within β-sheet. As a result, we conclude that A21 is at the edge of the β-sheet structure formed (in part) by the LVFF sequence, and attribute the weak intensity at ~1610 cm −1 in the A21G mutant to the 13 C=O carbonyls of F19 and F20.

Solid-state NMR is complementary to FTIR spectroscopy and allows us to probe local structure. Fig. 5 presents the results from 2D magic angle spinning NMR spectra of C55 obtained with dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR). Figs. 5A-D show selected rows from the 2D spectra corresponding to the 13 C=O resonances of F19, F20, G29 and A30. Comparison of the WT C55 (black) and A21G (red) spectra illustrates that the A21G mutation induces distinct changes in chemical shift at some positions, but not others.

Figs. 5E, F and Table S1 summarize the chemical shifts of selected Cα and C=O resonances between L17 and I31. The chemical shifts are plotted as differences from the average residue chemical shifts. Deviations to lower chemical shift values correspond to β-sheet secondary structure. Deviations to higher chemical shift values correspond to α-helical secondary structure. For WT C55, the Cα and C=O resonances between L17 and A21 all exhibit negative deviations corresponding to β-strand or sheet structure. The observation of β-structure is consistent with the FTIR results, but contrasts with solution NMR structures previously determined of this region ( Beel et al., 2008 ; Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ). Mutation to A21G results in less negative deviations of both the Cα and C=O chemical shifts for residues F19-A21 suggesting that there is a reduction in β-structure. G29 and A30 both exhibit positive deviations consistent with the helical TM domain beginning at K28. Mutation to A21G does not alter these latter chemical shifts. The two residues probed between the LVFF region and the TM domain – V24 and G25 – exhibit negative shifts in WT C55 and positive shifts in the A21G mutant, suggesting a shift in local secondary structure to α-helix.

The conclusion that the region between G25 and G29 increases in helical structure in the A21G mutant is supported by DARR NMR measurements between these two residues. Fig. 6A presents DARR NMR spectra of the WT (black) and A21G C55 (red) peptides 13 C labeled at G25 and G29. The distance between the 13 C=O and 13 Cα carbons is ~5.3 Å, which is within the ~6 Å DARR distance range when this region is α-helical. However, this distance is considerably longer (~12-13 Å) in an extended conformation. Comparison of the two spectra shows the appearance of the cross peak (arrow) correlating the G25 13 C=O and G29 13 Cα resonances in the A21G mutant. The appearance of the G25 13 C=O to G29 13 Cα cross peak is consistent with the stretch of amino acids between these residues folding into helical structure in the A21G mutant.

For comparison to A21, we studied the adjacent two positions (E22 and D23), which are also sites of familial AD mutations, using FTIR and MAS NMR. In FTIR measurements of C55 containing either the E22Q or D23N mutations ( Fig. S5C and D ), the incorporation of 13 C=O at F19 leads to a splitting of the 1626 cm −1 band as in WT C55. In MAS NMR measurements ( Fig. S5G and H ), 13 C=O labeling at F19, V24 and G25 in E22Q or D23N C55 also yields spectra similar to WT C55, and not the large chemical shift changes observed in the A21G mutant.

These observations highlight the critical position of A21. Mutation of the LVFF sequence just N-terminal to A21 can decrease the β-sheet structure in the extracellular domain and decrease Aβ secretion. In contrast, mutations just C-terminal to A21 do not significantly influence C55 structure or Aβ processing. These studies agree with previous results showing that A21G exhibits distinct phenotypes from familial mutations at E22 and D23 ( De Jonghe et al., 1998 ; Tian et al., 2010 ). To further test the idea that the influence of the A21G mutation is similar to that of mutations in the LVFF sequence rather than in the ED sequence, we measured Aβ secretion in a series of A21 mutants. In Fig. 7 , we show that extension of the LVFF sequence with an A21F substitution reduces Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion, whereas extension of the E22-D23 sequence with an A21E substitution increases Aβ secretion similar to the observation in the A21G mutant.

In soluble proteins, glycines serve as both helix and β-sheet breakers. However in TM helices, glycines mediate helix dimerization ( Lemmon et al., 1992 ). The TM region of APP is unusual in containing three consecutive GxxxG motifs. The A21G mutation generates a fourth consecutive GxxxG motif. The observation that the helical secondary structure increases in the region between G25 and G29 in the A21G mutant raises the possibility that the helical G 25 xxxG 29 motif stabilizes a TM dimer of C55.

The dimer structure of the TM domain of APP has been reported in both detergent micelles ( Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ) and in membrane bilayers ( Sato et al., 2009 ). In DMPC:DMPG bilayers, the TM domain dimerizes via the G 29 xxxG 33 xxxG 37 interface ( Sato et al., 2009 ). In contrast, the G 38 xxxA 42 sequence mediates dimerization in dodecylphosphocholine micelles ( Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ). 2D DARR NMR experiments were designed to test if either of these dimer interfaces exists in WT C55 or in the A21G mutant. These experiments involve co-mixing of two different peptides where cross peaks in the 2D spectra are only observed between heterodimers. Specifically, 13 C labels were selectively incorporated at G33 and A42 in two different C55 peptides (peptide 1 contains G33 13 C=O and A42 13 Cβ and peptide 2 contains G33 13 Cα and A42 13 C=O). In the heterodimer, the G33 residues are closely packed if the G 33 xxxG 37 motif mediates dimerization, whereas the A42 residues are in close proximity if the G 38 xxxA 42 motif mediates dimerization.

The two WT C55 (or the two 13 C-labeled A21G C55) peptides were reconstituted into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC): 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphoserine (POPS) membranes in equimolar amounts. Fig. 8 presents the DARR NMR spectrum of WT C55 (black) overlaid with the spectrum of the A21G mutant (red). In both the WT and A21G C55 peptides, inter-peptide cross peaks are observed between G33 ( 13 Cα) and G33 ( 13 C=O) (red box), but not between A42 ( 13 Cβ) and A42 ( 13 C=O) (blue box). No intensity was observed at this position in DARR NMR spectra of the single peptides containing the G33 13 C=O and A42 13 Cβ labels alone or the G33 13 Cα and A42 13 C=O labels alone, and the cross peak was reduced with the addition of unlabeled peptide (not shown). The cross peak was only observed when the two peptides were mixed.

It is possible to relate the intensity of the cross peaks to the proportion of the peptide associating as dimers if one assumes that the packing interactions within the dimer structure are the same for WT C55 and the A21G mutant. In Fig. 8A , the cross peak intensity increases ~1.5 fold (relative to the spinning side band at ~26 ppm) suggesting that the Kd decreases for the A21G mutant of C55 compared to the WT sequence. Since dimerization is occurring within the membrane bilayer, it is possible to define a Kd in terms of the concentration of C55 (relative to the amount of lipid) that yields equal amounts of monomer and dimer ( Song et al., 2013 ). If we assume that the cross peak intensity for dimer corresponds to that for C55 in cholesterol-containing membranes ( Figs. 8B,C ), we can estimate a Kd of ~2 mol% on the basis of the cross peak intensities observed in Fig. 8A . However, it is important to note that we cannot yet rule out that the increase in cross peak intensity results in a change in the dimer interface rather than a change in affinity. In either case, changes in the G33-G33 cross peak intensity show that a change within the structure of the extracellular domain of C55 can be transmitted down to the TM domain in the absence of the γ-secretase complex.

Both familial mutations and environmental factors influence Aβ generation by γ-secretase. For example, a higher concentration of serum cholesterol has been statistically observed as a risk factor for AD ( Kivipelto et al., 2001 ). Hypercholesterolemia leads to an increase in Aβ deposition and intraneuronal accumulation of toxic Aβ oligomers in transgenic mice ( Umeda et al., 2012 ). NMR studies reveal that cholesterol interacts with the β-CTF at the JM boundary between the extracellular and TM domains in micelles or detergent/lipid mixtures ( Barrett et al., 2012 ). On the basis of our observations in the A21G mutant, we investigated the possibility that cholesterol may influence the structure of the extracellular region of the β-CTF and enhance the structural changes induced by the A21G mutation.

To test the influence of cholesterol on the structure of the LVFF sequence, FTIR spectra are presented in Fig. S6 of C55 13 C-labeled at F19. We observe a splitting of the 1626 cm −1 band as for the WT peptide in bilayers without cholesterol arguing that cholesterol does not influence the LVFF anti-parallel β-sheet structure. In contrast, the addition of cholesterol to POPC:POPS bilayers results in a 2.2 ppm downfield shift of the NMR 13 C=O resonance of G25, although without influencing the carbonyl chemical shifts of F20 or G33, resonances observed to be sensitive to cholesterol in detergent ( Beel et al., 2008 ). This observation is consistent with a shift to more helical structure in the region of G25.

The increase in helical secondary structure in the region between G25 and G29 is supported by intra-helical DARR NMR measurements. Fig. 6B presents the DARR spectra of WT C55 reconstituted in POPC:POPS (blue) and in POPC:POPS:cholesterol (red) using the same 13 C labeling scheme as described above. In Fig. 6B , the cross peak between G25 13 C=O and G29 13 Cα is only observed in WT C55 upon the addition of cholesterol. The appearance of the G25-G29 cross peak in the A21G mutant or upon the addition of cholesterol in WT C55 indicates that both conditions induce TM helical structure of the C55 peptide.

The observation that both the A21G mutant and cholesterol addition result in a G25-G29 cross peak raises the question as to whether these two different mechanisms can act synergistically. Fig. 6C presents 2D DARR NMR spectra of the WT (blue) and A21G C55 (red) peptide in POPC:PS:cholesterol bilayers using the same 13 C labeling scheme as above. The intensity of the cross peak of the A21G mutant is ~1.5-fold higher in the cholesterol containing membranes consistent with a synergistic effect.

We next investigated whether cholesterol influences the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the WT or A21G C55 peptides. Fig. 8B presents a comparison of the inter-helical G33-G33 dimer cross peak upon the incorporation of cholesterol into POPC:POPS membranes. Rows highlighting the interhelical G33 ( 13 Cα) -G33 ( 13 C=O) cross peak at 46.2 ppm are shown for WT C55 (black) reconstituted into POPC:POPS:cholesterol bilayers and for the A21G mutant (red) reconstituted into POPC:POPS:cholesterol bilayers. The cross peak intensity for WT C55 with cholesterol is approximately the same as that for the A21G peptide without cholesterol in POPC:POPS membranes, suggesting that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is approximately the same. When the A21G mutant is incorporated into POPC:POPS:cholesterol membranes (red), the cross peak intensity increases ~2-fold, consistent with a synergistic effect of A21G and cholesterol. Fig. 8C illustrates the influence of cholesterol on the G33-G33 cross peak intensity as cholesterol is increased in POPC:POPS bilayers from 0 to 30 mol%. As discussed for the A21G mutation, the increase in cross peak intensity may be due to a change in conformation rather than affinity. However, both A21G and cholesterol appear to have the same influence on TM interactions.

## Discussion
The A21G mutation has a strong influence on intramembranous processing by the γ-secretase complex. We address how the loss of a single methyl group alters the structure of the extracellular region and TM domain using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, and propose how these changes are linked to processing of the β-CTF. FTIR and NMR measurements of C55 in bilayers provide evidence that β-strand secondary structure is adopted in the extracellular region of the β-CTF and that the A21G mutation influences the upstream LVFF sequence (particularly F19 and F20) and the downstream GSNKG sequence with a small effect on TM dimerization. These data emphasize the ability of glycine to destabilize β-sheet structure ( Minor and Kim, 1994 ) and to stabilize TM dimers through GxxxG motifs ( Lemmon et al., 1992 ).

The Flemish mutation was first described by Hendriks et al. (1992) and later shown to increase Aβ production by ~2-fold ( De Jonghe et al., 1998 ). Yi and colleagues ( Tian et al., 2010 ) found that the extracellular LVFFAED sequence was inhibitory to the activity of γ-secretase. They observed that deletion of this sequence resulted in a 10-fold increase in secreted Aβ40. To more directly test the role of the LVFF sequence in regulating Aβ secretion, we substituted the LVFF sequence with four alanine residues and found that the mutation increases Aβ secretion (Aβ40 and Aβ42) ~4.5-fold, considerably less than the increase observed when the sequence is deleted, but much greater than the ~1.7 fold increase due to the A21G mutation ( Fig. 1 ).

Our studies suggest that A21 is at the edge of the β-sheet fold in the extracellular domain of the β-CTF. The FTIR measurements reveal only modest changes in the 1626 cm −1 band upon mutation of A21 to glycine. In contrast, the A21G mutation results in large changes in the chemical shifts at F19, F20 and G25 consistent with unraveling of the β-sheet structure at the end of the LVFF sequence and the formation of helical secondary structure in the GSNKG sequence. Strikingly, mutation of A21, but not the adjacent E22 and D23 residues, induces structural changes in the LVFF and GSNKG sequences and an increase in Aβ. A21 appears to be at a breakpoint between a well-defined β-strand and the TM helix; extension of the LVFF sequence with an A21F substitution reduces Aβ secretion, whereas extension of the E22-D23 sequence with an A21E substitution increases Aβ secretion ( Fig. 7 ).

The observation that the A21G mutation introduces an additional GxxxG motif into the β-CTF and that the G 25 xxxG 29 sequence becomes more helical suggests that the A21G mutation influences TM dimerization. Mutation of the consecutive G 29 xxxG 33 xxxG 37 motifs supports the idea that TM dimerization influences processing ( Kienlen-Campard et al., 2008 ; Munter et al., 2007 ). Recently, the dimer structure of residues Q15- K53 was determined in detergent micelles ( Nadezhdin et al., 2012 ). Surprisingly, the dimer interface in their NMR structure was formed from the G 38 xxxA 42 sequence rather than G 33 xxxG 37 .

Above we show unambiguously that the A21G dimer is mediated by the G 33 xxxG 37 interface. The strong G33 Cα and G33 C=O cross peak can only be explained by a well-defined dimer structure. The observation that the A21G mutation has only a small influence on the G33-G33 cross peak intensity implies the large influence of the mutation on processing is associated with the structural changes in the extracellular domain rather than with dimerization. These results support the conclusions of Tian et al. (2010) that the LVFFAED sequence is inhibitory.

Many cellular factors appear to influence the overall level of secreted Aβ peptides and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, including the presence of cholesterol ( Beel et al., 2008 ; Simons et al., 1998 ; Wahrle et al., 2002 ). Upon the addition of cholesterol to model membranes, we observe an increase in α-helical secondary structure, and in the A21G mutant, a shift of the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward dimer or reorientation of the dimer interface to strength the G33-G33 contact. It is known that cholesterol increases the thickness of the bilayer, and we infer that this induces an increase in the helical structure between G25 and G29, in a fashion similar to that of A21G. In neuronal axons, the concentration of cholesterol is estimated to be ~15% ( Calderon et al., 1995 ). These results suggest that dimerization is facilitated by the G 25 xxxG 29 interface in A21G, and that cholesterol helps stabilize this interface. Together our studies and recent studies by Sanders and coworkers ( Song et al., 2013 ) indicate that dimerization of the WT TM sequence of APP is weak, but can be modulated by protein concentration, mutation and the membrane environment.

The results on the A21G mutation and added cholesterol point to a simple model in which structural changes in the extracellular sequence (LVFFAEDVGSNK) sequence lead to a reduction of inhibitory interactions and influence dimerization. The nature of the inhibitory interactions may originate with interactions between the LVFF sequence and γ-secretase ( Tian et al., 2010 ) or with the membrane surface ( Beel et al., 2008 ). The convergence of results reveals that both mutational and environmental factors can induce conformational changes in γ-secretase substrates that have implications in AD.

## Methods
13 C-amino acids were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Detergents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and lipids from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Human APP-specific antibody (WO-2) was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids used to express human APP695 or β-CTF in eukaryotic cells have been previously described ( Kienlen-Campard et al., 2008 ). The different mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to manufacturer’s instructions (Quick-Change™, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

CHO cells were cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 and transfected 24 h after seeding as previously described ( Kienlen-Campard et al., 2008 ). Western blotting was performed on cell lysates (10 μg protein). Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight with human APP-specific WO-2 monoclonal antibody (1:2000), washed and incubated with 1:10,000 secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by ECL revelation (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden). Aβ production was monitored in the culture media 48 h after transfection ( Kienlen-Campard et al., 2008 ). Briefly, samples were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 g , 3 min, 4 °C). Aβ38/Aβ40/Aβ42 and soluble APPα/β were quantified in 25 μl of cellular medium by multiplex ECLIA assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD).

C55 peptides (Asp1-Lys55) corresponding to the TM and JM regions of APP were synthesized by solid-phase methods (Keck Facility, Yale University). The purity was confirmed with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analytical reverse phase HPLC. For reconstitution into bicelles, the C55 peptides were refolded with 16 mM dihexoylphosphocholine (DHPC). The fractions containing purified protein were collected on the basis of the absorbance at 280 nm. The peptide to lipid ratio was 1:50 in bicelles with different q values (0.25, 0.35, 1.0, and 2.0) by adding proper amounts of lipids in the protein stock solutions. The samples of peptides reconstituted into bicelles were prepared by several cool-and-thaw cycles until the samples appeared clear.

The C55 sequence was subcloned into a pET21a vector and expressed with an N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal linker plus His-tag (KLAAALEHHHHHH). The C55 protein was purified using a Nickel NTA column. Cell pellets were washed 3 times with the 35 ml of lysis buffer until the washed solution became clear. The pellets were then dissolved in 35 ml of urea/SDS buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 0.2% SDS, pH 7.8) and mixed overnight at room temperature. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 25000 g for 20 min. The supernatants were pooled with the pre-equilibrium Nickel beads and mixed for 2 hours at room temperature. The beads were then washed with urea/SDS buffer and the proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole in Tris-buffered saline solution (pH 7.8) containing octyl-β-D-glucoside. The eluted fractions were collected and checked by SDS-PAGE. The protein purity was further confirmed with mass spectroscopy.

The C55 peptides were eluted from the Ni column and refolded with 16 mM dihexoylphosphocholine (DHPC) (Avanti lipids) in the elution buffer as described above. The fractions containing purified protein were collected on the basis of the absorbance at 260-280 nm. The peptide to lipid ratio was 1:50 in bicelles with different q values (0.25, 0.35, 1.0, and 2.0) by adding proper amounts of lipids in the protein stock solutions. The samples of peptides reconstituted into bicelles were prepared as described ( Lu et al., 2012 ) by several cool-and-thaw cycles until the samples appear clear.

The C55 peptides were cosolubilized with lipid and octyl-β-glucoside in hexafluoroisopropanol. The peptide:lipid molar ratio was 1:50 and the molar ratios between lipids were as follows: DMPC:DMPG, 10:3; POPC:POPS,10:3; or POPC:POPS:cholesterol, 10:3:5.6). The solution was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C, after which the solvent was removed under a stream of argon gas and then under vacuum overnight. MES buffer (5 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.2) was added to the solid from the previous step and gently mixed at 30 °C for 6 hours. The octyl-ß-glucoside was removed by dialysis ( Smith et al., 2002 ). DMPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) are representative lipids with saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl chains, respectively, while the DMPG and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS) headgroups introduce an overall negative membrane charge similar to that in cellular plasma membranes. DMPC can be titrated with DHPC to convert from membrane bilayers to isotropic (detergent-like) bicelles. POPC is abundant in plasma membranes and exhibits a continuous transition from a liquid disordered state to liquid ordered state with the addition of cholesterol ( London, 2005 ). In our studies, only small differences were observed in the FTIR and NMR spectra between C55 reconstituted into POPC:PS or DMPC:PG bilayers. The only marked differences were observed upon titration of cholesterol into the POPC:PS membranes.

Polarized attenuated total reflection (ATR) FTIR spectra were obtained on a Bruker IFS 66V/S spectrometer. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the global secondary structure, and the orientation of the TM domain of C55 in bilayers. The WT and A21G C55 peptides reconstituted in bilayers were layered on a germanium plate and bulk water removed by a slow flow of nitrogen gas. Similar dichroic ratios of the 1657 cm −1 band of 3.2-3.3 are observed for both peptides regardless of the lipid mixture used in these studies. The high dichroic ratio is consistent with an orientation of the TM α-helix of ~20° relative to the bilayer normal and indicates that both peptides can be reconstituted into bilayers by detergent dialysis.

NMR experiments were performed at a 13 C frequency of 125 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer. The MAS spinning rate was set to 9-11 KHz (± 5 Hz). The ramped amplitude cross polarization contact time was 2 ms. Two-pulse phase-modulated decoupling was used during the evolution and acquisition periods with a radiofrequency field strength of 80 kHz. Internuclear 13 C… 13 C distance constraints were obtained from 2D dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) NMR experiments ( Takegoshi et al., 2001 ) using a mixing time of 600 ms. The sample temperature was maintained at 198 K (± 2 K). 13 C chemical shifts are referenced to external 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS).
