Parvalbumin neurons and gamma rhythms enhance cortical circuit performance

# Abstract
Synchronized oscillations and inhibitory interneurons have important and interconnected roles within cortical microcircuits. In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin 1 , 2 have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30–80 Hz) oscillations 3 – 7 , which are hypothesized to enhance information processing 8 , 9 . However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia 10 and autism 11 ). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies 12 – 14 in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo , whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry.

## METHODS SUMMARY
We used a double-floxed inverted open reading frame strategy ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figs 1 and 4 ) with two nested pairs of incompatible lox sites. In Cre-expressing cells, ChR2–eYFP or eNpHR–eYFP is first reversibly flipped into the sense orientation via either pair of sites ( Fig. 1b ); this enables a second irreversible excision that prevents further inversion ( Fig. 1b ). Double-floxed reversed ChR2–eYFP or eNpHR–eYFP virus was injected stereotactically into infralimbic cortex of 5–6-week-old PV :: Cre mice.

Simultaneous optical stimulation and electrical recording in infralimbic and prelimbic cortex of PV::Cre transgenic mice was carried out as described previously 6 . We recorded local field potentials in mice anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture, and calculated power spectra immediately after blue light flashes that were separated from other flashes by at least 25 ms.

Patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and dynamic clamp were carried out as described previously 5 . All recordings were at 32.5 ± 1 °C unless stated otherwise. We stimulated ChR2 in pyramidal neurons using flashes of light lasting 1 ms generated by a 300 W Xenon lamp and a GFP filter set delivered to the slice through a ×40 objective. We used 5-ms light flashes to stimulate ChR2 in fast-spiking interneurons. We stimulated eNpHR in PV interneurons in vitro using continuous yellow light generated analogously using a 593nm filter set.

Experiments were divided into 5- or 10-s long sweeps, which were subdivided into 500-ms segments, containing 0–250 sEPSCs. Rhythmic and non-rhythmic trains used the same sequence of sEPSC rates. For non-rhythmic trains, sEPSCs occurred randomly across each segment. Within rhythmic trains, sEPSCs occurred only during half of each 25 or 125 ms cycle.
