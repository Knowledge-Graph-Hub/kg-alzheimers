# Title
Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system

# Abstract
Targeted nucleases are powerful tools for mediating genome alteration with high precision. The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. to minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1–2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2–3 weeks.

## INTRODUCTION
The ability to engineer biological systems and organisms holds enormous potential for applications across basic science, medicine and biotechnology. Programmable sequence-specific endonucleases that facilitate precise editing of endogenous genomic loci are now enabling systematic interrogation of genetic elements and causal genetic variations 1 , 2 in a broad range of species, including those that have not previously been genetically tractable 3 – 6 . A number of genome editing technologies have emerged in recent years, including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) 7 – 10 , transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs) 10 – 17 and the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas nuclease system 18 – 25 . The first two technologies use a strategy of tethering endonuclease catalytic domains to modular DNA-binding proteins for inducing targeted DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic loci. By contrast, Cas9 is a nuclease guided by small RNAs through Watson-Crick base pairing with target DNA 26 – 28 ( Fig. 1 ), representing a system that is markedly easier to design, highly specific, efficient and well-suited for high-throughput and multiplexed gene editing for a variety of cell types and organisms.

Similarly to ZFNs and TALENs, Cas9 promotes genome editing by stimulating a DSB at a target genomic locus 29 , 30 . Upon cleavage by Cas9, the target locus typically undergoes one of two major pathways for DNA damage repair ( Fig. 2 ): the error-prone NHEJ or the high-fidelity HDR pathway, both of which can be used to achieve a desired editing outcome. In the absence of a repair template, DSBs are re-ligated through the NHEJ process, which leaves scars in the form of insertion/deletion (indel) mutations. NHEJ can be harnessed to mediate gene knockouts, as indels occurring within a coding exon can lead to frameshift mutations and premature stop codons 31 . Multiple DSBs can additionally be exploited to mediate larger deletions in the genome 22 , 32 .

HDR is an alternative major DNA repair pathway. Although HDR typically occurs at lower and substantially more variable frequencies than NHEJ, it can be leveraged to generate precise, defined modifications at a target locus in the presence of an exogenously introduced repair template. The repair template can either be in the form of conventional double-stranded DNA targeting constructs with homology arms flanking the insertion sequence, or single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs). The latter provides an effective and simple method for making small edits in the genome, such as the introduction of single-nucleotide mutations for probing causal genetic variations 32 . Unlike NHEJ, HDR is generally active only in dividing cells, and its efficiency can vary widely depending on the cell type and state, as well as the genomic locus and repair template 33 .

CRISPR-Cas is a microbial adaptive immune system that uses RNA-guided nucleases to cleave foreign genetic elements 18 – 21 , 26 . Three types (I–III) of CRISPR systems have been identified across a wide range of bacterial and archaeal hosts, wherein each system comprises a cluster of CRISPR-associated ( Cas ) genes, noncoding RNAs and a distinctive array of repetitive elements (direct repeats). These repeats are interspaced by short variable sequences 20 derived from exogenous DNA targets known as protospacers, and together they constitute the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) array. Within the DNA target, each protospacer is always associated with a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which can vary depending on the specific CRISPR system 34 – 36 .

The Type II CRISPR system is one of the best characterized 26 – 28 , 37 , 38 , consisting of the nuclease Cas9, the crRNA array that encodes the guide RNAs and a required auxiliary trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) that facilitates the processing of the crRNA array into discrete units 26 , 28 . Each crRNA unit then contains a 20-nt guide sequence and a partial direct repeat, where the former directs Cas9 to a 20-bp DNA target via Watson-Crick base pairing ( Fig. 1 ). In the CRISPR-Cas system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes (which is the system used in this protocol), the target DNA must immediately precede a 5′-NGG PAM 27 , whereas other Cas9 orthologs may have different PAM requirements, such as those of S. thermophilus (5′-NNAGAA 22 , 26 for CRISPR1 and 5′-NGGNG 28 , 37 for CRISPR3) and Neisseria meningiditis (5′-NNNNGATT) 39 .

The RNA-guided nuclease function of CRISPR-Cas is reconstituted in mammalian cells through the heterologous expression of human codon–optimized Cas9 and the requisite RNA components 22 – 25 . Furthermore, the crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused together to create a chimeric, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) 27 ( Fig. 1 ). Cas9 can thus be re-directed toward almost any target of interest in immediate vicinity of the PAM sequence by altering the 20-nt guide sequence within the sgRNA.

Given its ease of implementation and multiplexing capacity, Cas9 has been used to generate engineered eukaryotic cells carrying specific mutations via both NHEJ and HDR 22 – 25 , 40 . Direct injection of sgRNA and mRNA encoding Cas9 into embryos has enabled the rapid generation of transgenic mice with multiple modified alleles 41 , 42 . These results hold enormous promise for editing organisms that are otherwise genetically intractable.

Cas9 nucleases carry out strand-specific cleavage by using the conserved HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which can be mutated and exploited for additional function 37 . An aspartate-to-alanine (D10A) mutation in the RuvC catalytic domain 27 , 28 allows the Cas9 nickase mutant (Cas9n) to nick rather than cleave DNA to yield single-stranded breaks, and the subsequent preferential repair through HDR 22 can potentially decrease the frequency of unwanted indel mutations from off-target DSBs. Appropriately offset sgRNA pairs can guide Cas9n to simultaneously nick both strands of the target locus to mediate a DSB, thus effectively increasing the specificity of target recognition 43 . In addition, a Cas9 mutant with both DNA-cleaving catalytic residues mutated has been adapted to enable transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli 44 , demonstrating the potential of functionalizing Cas9 for diverse applications, such as recruitment of fluorescent protein labels or chromatin- modifying enzymes to specific genomic loci for reporting or modulating gene function.

Here we explain in detail how to use a human codon–optimized, nuclear localization sequence-flanked wild-type (WT) Cas9 nuclease or mutant Cas9 nickase to facilitate eukaryotic gene editing. We describe considerations for designing the 20-nt guide sequence, protocols for rapid construction and functional validation of sgRNAs and finally the use of the Cas9 nuclease to mediate both NHEJ- and HDR-based genome modifications in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293FT) and human stem cell (HUES9) lines ( Fig. 3 ). The Cas9 system can similarly be applied to other cell types and organisms, including humans 22 , 23 , 25 , mice 22 , 41 , 45 , zebrafish 45 , Drosophila 46 and Caenorhabditis elegans 47 .

As with other designer nuclease technologies such as ZFNs and TALENs, Cas9 can facilitate targeted DNA DSBs at specific loci of interest in the mammalian genome and stimulate genome editing via NHEJ or HDR. Cas9 offers several potential advantages over ZFNs and TALENs, including the ease of customization, higher targeting efficiency and the ability to facilitate multiplex genome editing. As custom ZFNs are often difficult to engineer, we will primarily compare Cas9 with TALEN.

Cas9 can be easily retargeted to new DNA sequences by simply purchasing a pair of oligos encoding the 20-nt guide sequence. In contrast, retargeting of TALEN for a new DNA sequence requires the construction of two new TALEN genes. Although a variety of protocols exist for TALEN construction 14 , 17 , 48 , 49 , it takes substantially more hands-on time to construct a new pair of TALENs.

WT S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is known to make a blunt cut between the 17th and 18th bases in the target sequence (3 bp 5′ of the PAM) 27 . Mutating catalytic residues in either the RuvC or the HNH nuclease domain of SpCas9 converts the enzyme into a DNA nicking enzyme 22 , 27 . In contrast, TALENs cleave nonspecifically in the 12–24-bp linker between the pair of TALEN monomer-binding sites 50 .

SpCas9 and TALENs have both been shown to facilitate efficient genome editing in a variety of cell types and organisms. However, owing to the ease of targeting, Cas9 can be used to target multiple genomic loci simultaneously, by co-delivering a combination of sgRNAs to the cells of interest.

Cas9 can be targeted to specific genomic loci via a 20-nt guide sequence on the sgRNA. The only requirement for the selection of Cas9 target sites is the presence of a PAM sequence directly 3′ of the 20-bp target sequence. Each Cas9 ortholog has a unique PAM sequence; for example, SpCas9 requires a 5′-NGG PAM sequence. This PAM requirement does not severely limit the targeting range of SpCas9—in the human genome, such target sites can be found on average every 8–12 bp (refs. 22 , 51 ). In addition to the targeting range, another possible limitation is the potential for off-target mutagenesis; please see Boxes 1 and 2 for details and strategies on minimizing off- target modifications.

The specificity of the Cas9 nuclease is determined by the 20-nt guide sequence within the sgRNA. For the S. pyogenes system, the target sequence (e.g., 5′-GTCACCTCCAATGACTAGGG-3′) must immediately precede (i.e., be 5′ to) a 5′-NGG PAM, and the 20-nt guide sequence base pairs with the opposite strand to mediate Cas9 cleavage at ~3 bp upstream of the PAM ( Figs. 1 and 4a top strand example). Note that the PAM sequence is required to immediately follow the target DNA locus, but that it is not a part of the 20-nt guide sequence within the sgRNA.

Thus, there are two main considerations in the selection of the 20-nt guide sequence for gene targeting: (i) the 5′-NGG PAM for S. pyogenes Cas9 and (ii) the minimization of off-target activity 51 , 52 . We provide an online CRISPR Design Tool ( http://tools.genome-engineering.org ) that takes a genomic sequence of interest and identifies suitable target sites. To experimentally assess off-target genomic modifications for each sgRNA, we also provide computationally predicted off-target sites (for a detailed discussion, see Box 1 ) for each intended target, ranked according to our quantitative specificity analysis on the effects of base-pairing mismatch identity, position and distribution. For increased targeting specificity, an alternative strategy using the D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 (Cas9n) along with a pair of sgRNAs may be used. The design criteria for orientation and spacing of such sgRNA pairs are described in Box 2 .

The CRISPR Design Tool provides the sequences for all oligos and primers necessary for (i) preparing the sgRNA constructs, (ii) assaying target modification efficiency and (iii) assessing cleavage at potential off-target sites. It is worth noting that because the U6 RNA polymerase III promoter used to express the sgRNA prefers a guanine (G) nucleotide as the first base of its transcript 59 , an extra G is appended at the 5′ of the sgRNA where the 20-nt guide sequence does not begin with G ( Fig. 4b,c ). On rare occasions, certain sgRNAs may not work for reasons yet unknown; therefore, we recommend designing at least two sgRNAs for each locus and testing their efficiencies in the intended cell type.

Depending on the desired application, sgRNAs can be delivered as either PCR amplicons containing an expression cassette ( Fig. 4b ) or sgRNA-expressing plasmids ( Fig. 4c ). PCR-based sgRNA delivery appends the custom sgRNA sequence onto the reverse PCR primer used to amplify a U6 promoter template ( Fig. 4b ). The resulting amplicon could be co-transfected with a Cas9 expression plasmid pSpCas9. This method is optimal for rapid screening of multiple candidate sgRNAs, as cell transfections for functional testing can be performed shortly after obtaining the sgRNA-encoding primers. Because this simple method obviates the need for plasmid-based cloning and sequence verification, it is well suited for testing or co-transfecting a large number of sgRNAs for generating large knockout libraries or other scale-sensitive applications. Note that the sgRNA-encoding primers are over 100 bp long, compared with the ~20-bp-long oligos required for plasmid-based sgRNA delivery.

Construction of an expression plasmid for sgRNA is also simple and rapid, involving a single cloning step with a pair of partially complementary oligonucleotides. The oligo pairs encoding the 20-nt guide sequences are annealed and ligated into a plasmid (pSpCas9(BB), Fig. 4c ) bearing both Cas9 and the remainder of the sgRNA as an invariant scaffold immediately following the oligo cloning site. The transfection plasmids can also be modified to enable virus production for in vivo delivery. For these approaches, the following plasmids are used within this protocol: Cas9 alone (pSpCas9) or Cas9 with an invariant sgRNA scaffold and cloning sites for inserting a guide sequence (pSpCas9(BB)). For the backbone cloning construct, we have also fused 2A-GFP or 2A-Puro to Cas9 to allow screening or selection of transfected cells (pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP or pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro, respectively). Finally, we provide pSpCas9n(BB), a D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 for HDR and for double-nicking applications ( Box 2 ), along with the 2A-GFP and 2A-Puro fusion constructs (pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-GFP, pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro).

In addition to PCR and plasmid-based delivery methods, Cas9 and sgRNAs can be introduced into cells as mRNA and RNA, respectively.

Traditionally, targeted DNA modifications have required the use of plasmid-based donor repair templates that contain homology arms flanking the site of alteration 54 , 55 ( Fig. 2 ). The homology arms on each side can vary in length, but are typically longer than 500 bp (refs. 55 , 56 ). This method can be used to generate large modifications, including insertion of reporter genes such as fluorescent proteins or antibiotic resistance markers. The design and construction of targeting plasmids has been described elsewhere 57 .

More recently, ssODNs have been used in place of targeting plasmids for short modifications within a defined locus without cloning 32 . To achieve high HDR efficiencies, ssODNs contain flanking sequences of at least 40 bp on each side that are homologous to the target region, and they can be oriented in either the sense or antisense direction relative to the target locus. It is worth noting that targeting efficiencies can vary widely depending on cell type, target locus, type of repair donor and location of modification relative to the DSB site. As a rule of thumb, single-base correction rates drop approximately fourfold at 100 bp away from the DSB site, and beyond 200 bp away drug selection markers may be required 58 .

Isolation of clonal cell lines with specific modifications is often desired. This can be achieved after transfection by isolating single cells through either FACS (Steps 54–65) or serial dilutions (Steps 66–70), followed by an expansion period to establish a new clonal cell line. It is worth noting that cell types can vary substantially in their responses to single-cell isolation, and literature specific to the cell type of interest should be consulted.

In cells co-transfected with a pair of sgRNAs to mediate a genomic (micro)deletion or inversion, indel mutations can be detected either by the SURVEYOR nuclease assay 59 or by sequencing ( Fig. 5a ). Our online CRISPR Design Tool provides recommended primers for both approaches. However, SURVEYOR or sequencing primers can also be designed manually to amplify the region of interest from genomic DNA. Custom primers are chosen using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Primer-BLAST in order to avoid nonspecific amplification. SURVEYOR primers should be designed to amplify 200–400 bp on either side of the Cas9 target (for a total amplicon 400–800 bp long) to allow clear visualization of cleavage bands by gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 5b ). To prevent excessive primer dimer formation, SURVEYOR primers should be designed to be typically 18 to 25 nt long with melting temperatures of ~60 °C. For SURVEYOR assay or sequencing analysis, we recommend testing that each pair of candidate primers produces a single PCR product, as well as testing for the absence of nonspecific cleavage during the SURVEYOR nuclease digestion process ( Fig. 5 ).

HDR can be detected via PCR amplification, followed by either sequencing of the modified region or restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. PCR primers for these purposes should anneal outside the region spanned by the homology arms to avoid false detection of residual repair template (primers HDR-Fwd and HDR-Rev; Table 1 and Fig. 6a ). For ssODN-mediated HDR, SURVEYOR PCR primers may be used. Either the WT Cas9 nuclease or mutant Cas9 nickase can be used to mediate HDR, although the efficiency of the latter can vary widely by cell type.

Targeted genome modifications can also be detected by either Sanger or deep sequencing. For the former, genomic DNA from the modified region can be amplified with either SURVEYOR or HDR primers. Amplicons should be subcloned into a plasmid such as pUC19 for transformation, and individual colonies should be sequenced to reveal the clonal genotype.

Alternatively, deep sequencing is suitable for sampling a large number of samples or target sites. NGS primers are designed for shorter amplicons, typically in the 100–200-bp size range. For the detection of NHEJ mutations, it is important to design primers situated at least 50 bp from the Cas9 target site to allow for the detection of longer indels. For larger deletions mediated by multiple sgRNAs, priming sites should be designed outside the deleted region. We provide guidelines for a two-step PCR fusion method to attach bar-coded sequencing adaptors for multiplex deep sequencing. We recommend the Illumina platform for its generally low levels of false positive indel detection. By comparison, Ion Torrent is less suitable for indel analysis owing to high sequencing error rate with homo-polymers 60 . Detailed descriptions of NGS optimization and troubleshooting can be found in the Illumina user manual. Off-target indel analysis ( Box 1 ) can then be performed through read-alignment programs such as ClustalW, Geneious or simple custom sequence analysis scripts.

## PROCEDURE
Input target genomic DNA sequence. We provide an online CRISPR Design Tool ( http://tools.genome-engineering.org ) that takes an input sequence (for example, a 1-kb genomic fragment from the region of interest), identifies and ranks suitable target sites and computationally predicts off-target sites for each intended target. Alternatively, one can manually select guide sequences by identifying the 20-bp sequence directly upstream of any 5′-NGG.

Order necessary oligos and primers as specified by the online tool. If the cleavage site is chosen manually, the oligos or primers should be designed as described in Figure 4b,c .

Design and order custom ssODN. Purchase either the sense or antisense ssODN directly from IDT or the preferred supplier. We recommend manually designing homology arms of at least 40 nt on either side and preferably 90 nt for optimal HDR efficiency. It is not necessary to PAGE-purify the ssODN.

Resuspend and dilute ssODN ultramers to a final concentration of 10 μM. Do not combine or anneal the sense and antisense ssODNs. Store them at –20 °C.

To generate the sgRNA expression construct, use either the PCR expression cassette (option A) or the plasmid-based procedure (option B).

(A) Generation of the sgRNA expression construct by PCR amplification ● TIMING 2 h Preparation of diluted U6 PCR template. We recommend using pSpCas9(BB) or pSpCas9n(BB) ( supplementary Data 2 ) as a PCR template, but any U6-containing plasmid can be used. Dilute the template with ddH 2 O to a concentration of 10 ng μl –1 . Note that if a plasmid or cassette already containing a U6-driven sgRNA is used as a template, a gel extraction will need to be performed after PCR (Step 5A(iv)), using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, to ensure that the product contains only the intended sgRNA and no trace of sgRNA carryover from the template. Preparation of diluted PCR primers.

Dilute the template with ddH 2 O to a concentration of 10 ng μl –1 . Note that if a plasmid or cassette already containing a U6-driven sgRNA is used as a template, a gel extraction will need to be performed after PCR (Step 5A(iv)), using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, to ensure that the product contains only the intended sgRNA and no trace of sgRNA carryover from the template.

? TROUBLESHOOTING

▲ CRITICAL The CRISPR-Cas system has been used in a number of mammalian cell lines. Conditions may vary for each cell line. Below we detail transfection conditions for HEK 293FT cells. Note that ssODN-mediated HDR transfections, performed with Amaxa SF cell line Nucleofector kit, are described in Steps 14–29. For hESC (HUES9) culturing and transfection, follow Steps 30–53. 6 HEK 293FT maintenance. Cells are maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells are cultured in D10 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . 7 To passage, remove the medium and rinse the cells once by gently adding DPBS to the side of the vessel, so as not to dislodge the cells. Add 2 ml of TrypLE to a T75 flask, and incubate the mixture for 5 min at 37 °C. Add 10 ml of warm D10 medium to inactivate the trypsin, and transfer the cells to a 50-ml Falcon tube. Dissociate the cells by pipetting them up and down gently, and then reseed them into new flasks as necessary.

▲ CRITICAL STEP We typically passage cells every 2–3 d at a split ratio of 1:4 or 1:8, never allowing cells to reach more than 70% confluency. Cells are discarded upon reaching passage number 15. 8 Preparation of cells for transfection. Plate the well-dissociated cells onto 24-well plates in D10 medium without antibiotics 16–24 h before transfection. Seed the cells at a density of 1.3 × 10 5 cells per well in a total volume of 500 μl. Scale up or down according to the cell line supplier's manual as needed.

▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not plate more cells than the recommended density, as doing so may reduce transfection efficiency. 9 On the day of transfection, cells are optimal at 70–90% confluency. Cells can be transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or the Amaxa SF cell line 4D-Nucleofector X kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Transfections should be performed as follows: for sgRNAs cloned into pSpCas9(BB), transfect 500 ng of sequence-verified CRISPR plasmid (pSpCas9(sgRNA)); if you are transfecting more than one plasmid ( Box 2 ), mix them at equimolar ratios and use no more than 500 ng of total DNA. For sgRNA amplified by PCR, mix the following: pSpCas9 (Cas9 only) 400 ng sgRNA amplicon from Step 5A (each) 20 ng pUC19 (carrier DNA) Fill up total DNA to 500 ng

▲ CRITICAL STEP We recommend transfecting in technical triplicates for reliable quantification, and including transfection controls (e.g., GFP plasmid) to monitor transfection efficiency. pSpCas9(sgRNA)-2A-GFP or pSpCas9(sgRNA)-2A-Puro may be used in place of pSpCas9 if fluorescence sorting or drug selection, respectively, is desired. In addition, the pSpCas9(BB) cloning plasmid and/or the sgRNA amplicon may be transfected alone as a negative control for downstream functional assays. 10 Add Lipofectamine complex to the cells gently, as HEK 293FT cells can detach easily from the plate, which will result in a lower transfection efficiency. 11 Check cells after 24 h for transfection efficiency. The percentage of fluorescent cells in the transfection control (e.g., GFP) can be estimated by using a fluorescence microscope. Typically, more than 70% of cells are transfected.

Alternatively, if you are using ssODNs, simply resuspend them to a final concentration of 10 μM (see Step 4) and skip Steps 15 and 16. 15 Run a small amount of the linearized plasmid alongside uncut plasmid on a 0.8–1% (wt/vol) agarose gel to check for successful linearization. Linearized plasmids should run above the supercoiled plasmid. 16 Purify the linearized plasmid with the QIAQuick PCR Purification kit, and elute in 35 μl of EB buffer. 17 Preparation of cells for transfection.

Process pelleted cells directly for DNA extraction with the QuickExtract solution (Steps 71–74).

▲ CRITICAL Isolation of clonal cell populations from the transfected cells (Step 51) can be performed 24 h after transfection by FACS (Steps 54–65) or by serial dilutions (Steps 66–70). Given that cell types can vary greatly in their response to FACS, clonal-density dilution or other isolation procedures, literature specific to the cell type of interest should be consulted. 54 Preparation of FACS media. Cells can be sorted in regular D10 medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin. The antibiotics-containing medium should be filtered through a 0.22-μM Steriflip filter. If fluorescence sorting is also required, phenol red–free DMEM or DPBS is substituted for normal DMEM. 55 To 96-well plates, add 100 μl of D10 medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin per well.

Mark off the wells that are empty or that may have been seeded more than a single cell. 64 When the cells are more than 60% confluent, prepare replica plates for passaging (one well for each clone) by adding 100 μl of D10 medium to each well in the replica plates. Dissociate the cells directly by pipetting up and down vigorously 20 times, and plate 20% of each of the resuspended volumes into the replica wells to keep the clonal lines.

▲ CRITICAL STEP SURVEYOR assays rely on the detection of single-base mismatches; therefore, it is crucial to use a high-fidelity polymerase. Other high-fidelity polymerases, such as PfuUltra (Agilent) or Kapa HiFi (Kapa Biosystems), may be used as a substitute. In addition, because SURVEYOR cleavage results can detect naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms, it is important to run negative control samples of untransfected or otherwise unmodified cells. 76 Perform a PCR with the following cycling conditions, for no more than 30 amplification cycles: Cycle number Denature Anneal Extend 1 95 °C, 2 min 2-31 95 °C, 20 s 60 °C, 20 s 72 °C, 30 s 32 72 °C, 3 min 77 Run 2–5 μl of the PCR products on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel to check for single-band products.

■ PAUSE POINT The digested products with Stop Solution can be stored at –20 °C for at least 2 d at this point for later analysis. 84 Visualizing the SURVEYOR reaction. SURVEYOR nuclease digestion products can be visualized on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel. For better resolution, products can be run on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide TBE gel. Load 10 μl of the product with the recommended loading buffer and run the gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, we run the gel until the bromophenol blue dye has migrated to the bottom of the gel. Include the DNA ladder and negative (untransfected) controls on the same gel. 85 Stain the gel with SYBR Gold dye diluted 1:10,000 in TBE (20 μl of stock in 200 ml of TBE). Rock the gel gently for 15 min. Be sure to shield the staining solution from light to avoid photobleaching of the dye. 86 Image the gel by using a quantitative imaging system without overexposing the bands. The negative controls should have only one band corresponding to the size of the PCR product, but they may have occasional nonspecific cleavage bands of other sizes. These will not interfere with analysis if they are distinct in size from the target cleavage bands. The sum of target cleavage band sizes, provided by the CRISPR Design Tool, should be equal to the size of the PCR product.

## ANTICIPATED RESULTS
We have compiled a list of most-frequently asked questions from our web-based CRISPR discussion forum (discuss.genome-engineering.org) to clarify points of confusion when applying the CRISPR system ( Box 3 ). CRISPR-Cas can be easily multiplexed to facilitate high-efficiency genome editing in mammalian cells: by using two sgRNAs, we were able to demonstrate simultaneous targeting of the human DYRK1A and GRIN2B loci at efficiencies of 65–68% for each locus in HEK 293FT cells ( Fig. 5b ). Likewise, a pair of sgRNAs can be used to mediate microdeletions, such as excision of EMX1 exon 3, which we genotyped by PCR at a clonal level ( Fig. 5c ). Note that the precise location of exon junctions can vary. We also demonstrate here the use of ssODNs and targeting vector to mediate HDR ( Fig. 6a,b ) with both WT and the D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 in HEK 293FT and HUES9 cells ( Fig. 6c ). Note that we have not been able to detect HDR in HUES9 cells by using Cas9n with a sgRNA, which may be due to low efficiency or a potential difference in repair activities in HUES9 cells. The state of ploidy of the cell type of interest may also affect modification efficiency. However, Cas9n may be paired with two sgRNAs to mediate a DSB and stimulate HDR in HUES9 cells.
