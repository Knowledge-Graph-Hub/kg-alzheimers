# Title
Systematic identification oftrans-eQTLs as putative drivers of known disease associations

# Abstract
Identifying the downstream effects of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is challenging: the causal gene is often unknown or it is unclear how the SNP affects the causal gene, making it difficult to design experiments that reveal functional consequences. To help overcome this problem, we performed the largest expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis so far reported in non-transformed peripheral blood samples of 5,311 individuals, with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated trans -eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Although we did not study specific patient cohorts, we identified trait-associated SNPs that affect multiple trans -genes that are known to be markedly altered in patients: for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) SNP rs4917014 1 altered C1QB and five type 1 interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE 2 - 4 . Subsequent ChIP-seq data analysis on these trans -genes implicated transcription factor IKZF1 as the causal gene at this locus, with DeepSAGE RNA-sequencing revealing that rs4917014 strongly alters 3’ UTR levels of IKZF1 . Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.

## Online methods
We performed a whole-genome eQTL meta-analysis of 5,311 samples from peripheral blood, divided over a total of nine datasets from seven cohorts, including EGCUT 14 (N = 891), InCHIANTI 15 (N = 611), Rotterdam Study 16 (N = 762), Fehrmann 5 (N = 1,240 on the Illumina HT12v3 platform and N = 229 on the Illumina H8v2 platform), HVH 17 - 19 (N = 43 on the Illumina HT12v3 platform and N = 63 on the Illumina HT12v4 platform) SHIP-TREND 20 (N = 963), and DILGOM 21 (N = 509). Gene expression data for each dataset was obtained using either PAXGene (Becton Dickinson) or Tempus tubes (Life Technologies), followed by hybridization to Illumina whole-genome Expression BeadChips (HT12v3, HT12v4 or H8v2 arrays). The gene expression platforms were harmonized by matching probe sequences across the different platforms. Mappings for these sequences were obtained by mapping the sequences against the human genome build 36 (Ensembl build 54, Hg18) using BLAT, BWA and SOAPv2 sequence alignment programs. Highly stringent alignment criteria were used to ensure that probes map unequivocally to one single genomic position. Genotype data was acquired using different genotyping platforms, and harmonized by imputation, using the HapMap2 47 Central European population as a reference. Each dataset was individually checked for sample mix-ups using MixupMapper 48 . For a full description of the individual datasets, results of the sample mix-up analysis, specifics on the gene expression platforms and probe mapping procedure and filtering, see Supplementary methods .

Gene expression data was quantile-normalized to the median distribution, and subsequently log 2 transformed. The probe and sample means were centered to zero. Gene expression data was then corrected for possible population structure by removal of four multi-dimensional scaling components using linear regression. We reasoned earlier that normalized gene-expression data still contains large amounts of non-genetic variation 5 . After population stratification correction, principal component analysis (PCA) was therefore performed on the sample correlation matrix. We performed a separate QTL analysis for each principal component (PC), to ascertain whether genetic variants could be detected that affect the PC. If we found an effect on the PC, we did not correct the expression data for these components, to ensure we would not unintentionally remove genetic effects from the expression data. Significance of these associations was established by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), testing each association against a null-distribution created by repeating the analysis 100 times (permuting the sample labels for each iteration 49 ). PCs that did not show significance at the FDR threshold of 0.0 were removed from the gene expression data by linear regression. In all but two very small datasets, the first 40 PCs were removed (excluding those components per cohort that showed a QTL effect). We observed that the removal of these 40 components revealed the highest number of eQTLs in each dataset. Although PC correction may remove some eQTL effects, we observed that the majority (95% when removing 35 PCs and 90% when removing 40 PCs) of trans -eQTL effects was independent of the number of PCs removed ( Supplementary Figure 14 ).

After normalization of the data, we performed both cis - and trans -eQTL mapping. eQTLs were deemed cis -eQTLs, when the distance between the SNP chromosomal position and the probe midpoint was less than 250 kilobases (kb), while eQTLs with a distance greater than five megabases (mb) were defined as trans -eQTLs. Only SNPs with a minor allele-frequency (MAF) > 0.05 and a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value > 0.001 were included in the analyses. Since most cohorts had generated the gene expression data using the HT12v3 platform, we chose to only include probes that were present on this platform. We only tested SNP-probe pairs when the SNP passed quality control in at least three cohorts. Furthermore, in order to reduce issues with respect to computational time and multiple testing, we confined our trans eQTL analysis to those SNPs present in the “ Catalog of Published GWAS ” ( http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/ , accessed July 16 th , 2011). We reasoned that for genes with strong cis -eQTL effects, the cis -eQTL effect may obscure the detectability of trans -eQTL. Therefore, we used linear regression to remove cis -eQTL effects prior to trans -eQTL mapping and observed a 12% increase in the number of detected trans -eQTLs ( Supplementary Figure 15 ). For each cohort, eQTLs were mapped using a Spearman's rank correlation on the imputed genotype dosage values. We used a weighted Z-method for subsequent meta-analysis 50 . To get a realistic null-distribution, we permuted the sample identifiers labels of the expression data and repeated this analysis ten times ( Supplementary Figure 16 ). In each permutation the sample labels were permuted. We then corrected for multiple testing by controlling the FDR at 0.05, by testing each p-value in the real data against a null-distribution created from the permuted datasets 49 (see Supplementary methods ). It has been suggested that false-positive eQTL effects can arise due to polymorphisms in the probe sequences 51 , 52 . Therefore, we tested whether a significant cis -eQTL SNP was in LD (r 2 > 0.2) with any SNP in the cis -probe sequence, using the Western European subpopulations of the 1000 genomes project 25 (2011-05-21 release, 286 individuals, excluding Finnish individuals) as a reference. If we observed this to be the case the respective cis -eQTLs were removed. Furthermore, for each trans -eQTL we investigated whether portions of the probe sequence could map in the vicinity of the trans -eQTL SNP (which in fact would imply a cis -eQTL, rather than a trans -eQTL effect). Therefore, we tried to map the trans -eQTL probe sequences, using very permissive settings, within a 5 Mb window of the trans -eQTL SNP. SNP-probe combinations where the probe mapped with at least 15 bp within the 5 Mb window, were deemed false-positive and removed from further analysis. After this filtering we recalculated the FDR for both the cis - and trans -eQTL results.

Replication of the trans -eQTL results was carried out in five independent datasets from four cohorts, including data obtained from lymphoblastoid cell lines (HapMap3, N = 604 24 ), B-cells and monocytes (Oxford 9 , N = 282 and N = 283, respectively), and whole peripheral blood (KORA F4 22 , N = 740, and BSGS 23 , N = 862). All the cohorts applied the same methodology as used in the discovery phase to normalize the gene expression data, check for sample mix-ups and perform trans -eQTL mapping, including 10 permutations in order to establish the FDR threshold at 0.05. Finally, we performed a sample-size weighted Z-score meta-analysis on the two peripheral blood replication cohorts (KORA and BSGS). Further details on these datasets can be found in the Supplementary methods .

To determine whether the significant trans -eQTL SNPs were enriched for functional regions on the genome, we annotated the trans -eQTL SNPs using SNPInfo 53 , SNPNexus 54 , 55 , and HaploReg 56 , which integrate multiple data sources (such as ENCODE project data 31 , Ensembl 57 , and several micro-RNA databases). We limited these analyses to those trans -eQTL SNPs that were previously shown to be associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance levels (‘trait associated SNPs’, reported P < 5 × 10 -8 ). These SNPs were subsequently pruned (using PLINK's --clump command, using an r 2 < 0.2). We used the permuted trans -eQTL data to get realistic null-distributions for each of these tools: we selected equally sized sets of unlinked SNPs (r 2 < 0.2 in the Western-European subpopulations of the 1000 genomes project 25 , 2011-05-21 release, 286 individuals, excluding Finnish individuals) that showed the highest significance in the permuted data, ensuring that only trait-associated SNPs are included in the null-distribution, as it is known that trait-associated SNPs in general already have different functional properties than randomly selected SNPs 58 (e.g. trait-associated SNPs typically map in closer proximity to genes than random SNPs). We also ensured that none of the SNPs in the null-distribution were affecting genes in trans , or were linked to those SNPs (r 2 < 0.2 in 1000 genomes). We then identified perfect proxies (r 2 = 1.0 in 1000 genomes). For SNPInfo and SNPNexus, we calculated the enrichment for each functional category using a Fisher's exact test. We determined the enhancer enrichment in nine different cell-types using HaploReg, where we averaged the enhancer enrichment over the ten permutations.

We determined which unlinked trait-associated SNPs show eQTL effects on exactly the same gene: per trait, we analyzed the SNPs that are known to be associated with this trait and assessed whether any unlinked SNP pair (r 2 < 0.2, distance between SNPs > 5Mb) showed a cis - and/or trans -eQTL effect on exactly the same gene, as previously described 5 . To determine whether the number of traits for which we observed this phenomenon was higher than expected by chance, we re-ran this analysis 20 times, each time using a different set of permuted trans -eQTLs, equal in size to the non-permuted set of trans -eQTLs.

We used IKZF1 ChIP-seq signal data obtained from the ENCODE-project 31 (IKZF1 ChIP-seq data acquired and processed by UCSC, ENCODE March 2012 Freeze). For every human gene we determined the average signal (corrected for gene size), corrected for GC-content bias, and performed a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test to see whether the upregulated genes ( MX1, TNFRSF21, IFIT1/LIPA, HERC5, CLEC4C, IFI6 ) showed a higher ChIP-seq signal compared to all other human genes.

We have made a browser available for all significant trans -eQTL and cis -eQTL at http://www.genenetwork.nl/bloodeqtlbrowser . This browser also provides all trans -eQTLs that we detected at a somewhat less stringent false discovery rate of 0.5, to enable more in-depth post-hoc analyses.
