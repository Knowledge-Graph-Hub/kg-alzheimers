# Title
ER–mitochondria associations are regulated by the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction and are disrupted by ALS/FTD-associated
TDP-43

# Abstract
Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form tight structural associations
and these facilitate a number of cellular functions. However, the mechanisms by
which regions of the ER become tethered to mitochondria are not properly known.
Understanding these mechanisms is not just important for comprehending fundamental
physiological processes but also for understanding pathogenic processes in some
disease states. In particular, disruption to ER–mitochondria associations
is linked to some neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that the ER-resident
protein VAPB interacts with the
mitochondrial protein tyrosine
phosphatase-interacting protein-51 (PTPIP51) to regulate
ER–mitochondria associations. Moreover, we demonstrate that TDP-43, a protein pathologically linked to
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fronto-temporal dementia perturbs
ER–mitochondria interactions and that this is associated with disruption
to the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction and cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis. Finally, we show that overexpression of TDP-43 leads to activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β
(GSK-3β) and that
GSK-3β regulates the
VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction. Our results describe a
new pathogenic mechanism for TDP-43.

## Results
VAPB and PTPIP51 interact in a variety of
biochemical assays, and the region of PTPIP51 that mediates binding involves its central
coiled-coil domain (amino acids 84–174) 20 . To
gain insight into the domain(s) of VAPB involved in binding PTPIP51, we generated glutathione S -transferase (GST)
fusion proteins comprising the entire VAPB cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1–220), its N -terminal major sperm protein domain (amino acids 1–124),
its central coiled-coil domain (amino acids 142–207) and sequences
encompassing the C-terminal part of VAPB (amino acids 89–207) and tested their
abilities to bind to PTPIP51
in pull-down assays from PTPIP51-transfected cells. Only the entire VAPB cytoplasmic domain bound
PTPIP51 ( Fig. 1a ). Hence, the entire cytoplasmic domain of VAPB is required for binding to
PTPIP51 or the interaction
requires some topographical conformation that is lost in the smaller
VAPB fragments. We also
performed in vitro -binding studies with purified VAPB and PTPIP51 cytoplasmic domains that were
generated in E. coli . PTPIP51 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 36–470)
was incubated with either GST or GST-VAPB and the GST moiety used to isolate bound PTPIP51. GST-VAPB cytoplasmic domain but not GST
bound to PTPIP51 in these
assays ( Fig. 1b ). Together with our previous studies 20 , these results demonstrate that VAPB interacts with PTPIP51 in a number of different assays
including in vitro assays in the absence of other proteins.

The binding of VAPB to
PTPIP51 suggests that
these proteins act as tethers to link ER with mitochondria. We therefore
monitored how modulating VAPB
and PTPIP51 expression affects
ER–mitochondria associations via EM in mouse NSC34 motor neuron
cells. We quantified ER–mitochondria associations by determining the
proportion of the mitochondrial surface that was closely apposed
(<30 nm) to ER. Such an approach has been used by others 21 22 .

We first reduced VAPB and
PTPIP51 expression using
short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and identified one potent mouse VAPB siRNA and two PTPIP51 siRNAs. Consistent with previous
studies in HEK293 cells 20 , siRNA knockdown of VAPB did not influence expression of
PTPIP51 and knockdown of
PTPIP51 did not influence
expression of VAPB in NSC34
cells ( Fig. 2a ). Approximately 12% of the mitochondrial
surface was closely associated with ER in untreated and control siRNA cells.
However, siRNA knockdown of either VAPB or PTPIP51 significantly reduced these values ( Fig. 2b ). We also monitored how loss of VAPB and PTPIP51 affected
ER–mitochondria associations in human HEK293 cells using previously
characterized siRNAs that involved different sequences 20 .
Again, depletion of VAPB and
PTPIP51 reduced
ER–mitochondria associations (% mitochondrial surface closely apposed
to ER reduced by 29% in VAPB
siRNA and 46% in PTPIP51
siRNA-treated cells compared with control siRNA cells. Control vs VAPB siRNA P <0.05; control
vs PTPIP51 siRNA P <0.001. Data analysed by one-way analysis of variance and
Tukey’s multiple comparison test. N =22 cells for each
treatment and 245–352 mitochondria).

We next elevated the expression of VAPB and PTPIP51 via transfection. Cells were transfected with either
enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) control vector, ECFP-VAPB or PTPIP51 that was expressed using a
bicistronic internal ribosome entry site vector with AcGFP. The ECFP/AcGFP tags
were then utilized to isolate transfected cells using a cell sorter. The
proportion of the mitochondrial surface closely associated with ER in control
cells expressing ECFP alone was not significantly different to that in untreated
cells or cells treated with control siRNA ( Fig. 3a ).
However, expression of VAPB or
PTPIP51 markedly increased
ER–mitochondria associations ( Fig. 3a ). We also
monitored the effect of co-transfecting both VAPB and PTPIP51 and obtained a remarkable phenotype where large
proportions of the mitochondrial surface were closely associated with ER ( Fig. 3a,b ). Analyses of these images revealed the presence
of structures that appeared to tether ER with mitochondria ( Fig.
3c ); the average spacing between ER and mitochondria in the
VAPB+PTPIP51 co-transfected cells was
14.7 nm.

Confocal microscopy has also been utilized to study ER–mitochondria
interactions (for example, refs 1 , 10 ). Since overexpressing VAPB and PTPIP51 produced particularly striking
EM images, we reasoned that such phenotypes would be clearly discernible by
light microscopy. We therefore monitored the effect of transfecting
VAPB and/or PTPIP51 on ER mitochondria
co-localization by confocal microscopy. For these investigations, we utilized
CV1 cells since these have a flattened and spread morphology, which facilitates
such morphological analyses. Cells were transfected with ECFP control,
ECFP-VAPB,
haemagglutin-tagged PTPIP51
(PTPIP51-HA) or
ECFP-VAPB+PTPIP51-HA, and ER and mitochondria
co-localization monitored by immunostaining. ER was detected by labelling for
protein disulphide
isomerase (PDI) and mitochondria by labelling for translocase of the
outer mitochondrial membrane protein-20 (TOM20). Transfection of VAPB and/or PTPIP51 all noticeably increased
co-localization of ER and mitochondria and in agreement with the EM studies,
this phenotype was particularly striking in VAPB+PTPIP51 co-transfected cells ( Fig. 4 ).
To obtain unbiased quantitative data on the effects of VAPB and PTPIP51 overexpression on
ER–mitochondria co-localization, we used intensity correlation
analysis (ICA) to analyse the co-localization of PDI and TOM20 signals in the different
samples 23 . ICA is one of the most rigorous methods for
studying co-localization of proteins by confocal microscopy since it compares
the scatter plots of two stains against the product of the difference of the
pixel intensities of each of the two stains from their respective means. Thus,
unlike other methods, which simply compare co-localization of pixels, ICA also
determines whether the pixel intensities from the two signals vary in synchrony.
ICA yields an intensity correlation quotient, which is a statistically testable
single-value assessment of the relationship between two stained protein
pairs 23 . Transfection of VAPB, PTPIP51 and VAPB+PTPIP51 all significantly increased
co-localization of ER and mitochondria in these assays ( Fig.
4 ). Thus, modulating VAPB and PTPIP51 expression significantly influences
ER–mitochondria interactions in both EM and confocal light microscopy
assays.

We next enquired whether expression of ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 influenced
ER–mitochondria associations. To do so, we transfected NSC34 cells
with EGFP control vector, EGFP-TDP-43, or familial ALS mutant EGFP-TDP-43M337V, TDP-43Q331K, TDP-43A382T or TDP-43G348C. Transfected cells were
again isolated using a cell sorter via the EGFP tags and
ER–mitochondria associations were quantified by EM as described
above. We detected no change in the numbers of mitochondria or ER profiles in
the presence of either wild-type or mutant TDP-43. However, expression of both wild-type and mutant
TDP-43 all led to
significant reductions in ER–mitochondria associations ( Fig. 5a ). The finding that both wild-type TDP-43 and mutant TDP-43 disrupted
ER–mitochondria interactions is consistent with the phenotypes seen
in transgenic mice, where expression of both wild-type and mutant TDP-43 all induce disease 24 25 26 27 28 . We also enquired whether siRNA-mediated
loss of TDP-43 influenced
ER–mitochondria associations or the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction. However, loss of
TDP-43 had no effect on
either of these ( Fig. 6 ).

We next monitored whether transfection of wild-type or mutant TDP-43 influenced expression of
VAPB, PTPIP51 or mitofusin-2, a further protein that has
been linked to ER–mitochondria associations 10 .
To do so, cell-sorted control EGFP and EGFP-TDP-43-transfected cell proteins were probed on immunoblots
for VAPB, PTPIP51 and mitofusin-2. However, no differences in
expression of any of these proteins were detected in the different samples
( Fig. 5b ). Thus, the reduction in
ER–mitochondria interactions seen in cells expressing wild-type
TDP-43 or mutant
TDP-43 is not due to
changes in expression of VAPB, PTPIP51
or mitofusin-2.

To complement the above studies, we also quantified ER–mitochondria
associations in spinal cord motor neurons of 1-month-old homozygous
TDP-43 transgenic and
their non-transgenic littermates 26 . At this age, these
TDP-43 transgenic mice
develop motor defects and symptoms characteristic of ALS 26 .
Similar to control NSC34 cells, ~12% of the mitochondrial surface was
closely apposed to ER in the non-transgenic animals. However, in TDP-43 transgenic mice,
ER–mitochondria interactions were significantly reduced ( Fig. 5c ).

Since VAPB and PTPIP51 mediate
ER–mitochondria associations, and since expression of TDP-43 disrupted
ER–mitochondria associations, we enquired whether the expression of
TDP-43 influenced binding
of VAPB to PTIP51. To do so,
we transfected NSC34 cells with PTPIP51-HA and either EGFP control vector or wild-type or
ALS mutants of EGFP-TDP-43,
and monitored the amounts of endogenous VAPB bound to PTPIP51-HA in immunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with
the EM studies, expression of both wild-type and ALS mutant TDP-43 all reduced the amount of
VAPB that was bound to
PTPIP51 ( Fig. 7a ). We obtained similar results in HEK293 cells ( Fig. 7b ).

We also monitored the effect of TDP-43 on the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction in TDP-43 transgenic mice using immunoprecipitation assays. In
spinal cords, endogenous VAPB
bound to endogenous PTPIP51
in these assays ( Fig. 7c ), which is consistent with
previous results on endogenous VAPB–PTPIP51 binding in other tissues 20 . In
line with the data from the TDP-43-transfected NSC34 cells, no differences in the levels
of VAPB, PTPIP51 or mitofusin-2 were detected in spinal
cords of TDP-43 and
non-transgenic mice ( Fig. 7d ). However, the amounts of
PTPIP51 bound to
VAPB were significantly
reduced in the TDP-43
transgenic mice ( Fig. 7d ). Thus, expression of
ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43
disrupts ER–mitochondria interactions and this is associated with a
decrease in the binding of VAPB to PTPIP51.

Both ER and mitochondria are stores for intracellular Ca 2+ and the
ER–mitochondria interface, and MAMs regulate Ca 2+ exchange between the two organelles 1 2 10 20 . Indeed, we
have shown that siRNA loss of VAPB and PTPIP51 perturbs cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis
following its release from ER stores 20 . The TDP-43-induced disruption to the
VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction and ER–mitochondria
associations thus predict that TDP-43 may influence Ca 2+ homeostasis. We
therefore monitored the effect of overexpressing TDP-43 on cytosolic and mitochondrial
Ca 2+ levels after induction of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
receptor (IP3R)-mediated Ca 2+ release from ER stores. For these
experiments, we used HEK293 cells co-transfected with the M3 muscarinic-ACh-receptor
(M3R) and either control
vector or TDP-43, and
triggered physiological IP3R-mediated Ca 2+ release from ER stores
by application of the M3R
agonist oxotremorine-M. In
line with previous studies on VAPB, PTPIP51 and ER–mitochondria associations, we used
HEK293 cells for these experiments since they do not express endogenous
M3R and so provide a
useful model for monitoring cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels after release from ER 20 . Transfection of both
wild-type and mutant TDP-43
all induced significant increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ and decreases
in mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels ( Fig. 8 ). Such
findings are consistent with the observed TDP-43-induced decreases in ER–mitochondria and
VAPB–PTPIP51 interactions 20 .

To gain insight into the mechanism by which TDP-43 might influence the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction, we first tested
whether TDP-43 bound to
either VAPB or PTPIP51. To do so, we performed
immunoprecipitation assays from TDP-43+VAPB and TDP-43+PTPIP51-transfected cells. However, we did not detect
binding of TDP-43 to either
protein in these assays ( Fig. 9a ) or in yeast 2-hybrid
library screens with VAPB or
PTPIP51 baits 20 (and our unpublished data). Others have also reported that
TDP-43 does not bind
VAPB 29 .

Phosphorylation is a common mechanism for controlling protein–protein
interactions, and TDP-43 has
recently been shown to activate glycogen
synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) 30 . A major route for regulating GSK-3β is by inhibitory phosphorylation of
serine-9, and so we monitored GSK-3β serine-9 phosphorylation in control and
TDP-43-transfected cells
by immunoblotting. In agreement with previous studies 30 , we
found that overexpression of wild-type and four different TDP-43 mutants all activated
GSK-3β as
evidenced by reduced serine-9 phosphorylation ( Fig. 9b ).
To determine whether GSK-3β might regulate the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction, we modulated
GSK-3β activity
in transfected cells and monitored the effects on binding of VAPB to PTPI51 again using
immunoprecipitation assays. Two structurally different GSK-3β inhibitors both
increased, whereas transfection of GSK-3β to elevate its activity 31 reduced binding of VAPB to PTPIP51 ( Fig. 9c,d ). Thus,
TDP-43 activates
GSK-3β and
GSK-3β
regulates the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction.

## Discussion
Despite their fundamental importance to a variety of physiological processes, the
mechanisms that mediate and regulate ER–mitochondria associations are not
properly understood. Recently, we demonstrated an interaction between the resident
ER protein VAPB and the
mitochondrial protein PTPIP51
(ref. 20 ). VAPB is anchored in the ER via a C-terminal membrane-spanning
domain such that its N terminus projects into the cytoplasm, and
PTPIP51 is an outer
mitochondrial membrane protein whose C terminus projects into the
cytoplasm 20 . VAPB is also a MAM protein 20 . VAPB and PTPIP51 interact in yeast 2-hybrid,
immunoprecipitation (including transfected and endogenous proteins), GST pull-down
assays and proximity ligation assays, and recombinant VAPB and PTPIP51 cytoplasmic domains interact in
vitro in the absence of other proteins demonstrating direct binding 20 (and results presented here). Thus, VAPB and PTPIP51 represent plausible candidates for
mediating ER–mitochondria interactions.

To directly test this possibility, we used EM to monitor how modulating VAPB and PTPIP51 expression affects
ER–mitochondria associations. siRNA knockdown of VAPB or PTPIP51 reduced, whereas overexpression of VAPB and/or PTPIP51 markedly increased
ER–mitochondria associations. Indeed, overexpression of both
VAPB and PTPIP51 produced a remarkable phenotype
detectable by both EM and confocal microscopy, in which ER and mitochondria
redistribute to form close associations. Alterations to ER–mitochondria
interactions influence Ca 2+ exchange between these organelles, and we
have demonstrated previously that modulating VAPB and PTPIP51 expression induces such changes to Ca 2+ homeostasis 20 . Together, these findings support the
conclusion that VAPB and
PTPIP51 form at least one of
the scaffolds that mediate ER–mitochondria associations.

Abnormal TDP-43 metabolism is
strongly linked to both ALS and FTD. Thus, mutations in TDP-43 cause some familial forms of ALS and
FTD, accumulations of TDP-43 are
a hallmark pathology of ALS/FTD and overexpression of both wild-type and familial
ALS-associated mutants of TDP-43
all induce disease in transgenic rodents 17 24 25 26 27 28 32 . Despite these findings, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 toxicity are not properly known.
Although TDP-43 is a
predominantly nuclear protein, a proportion is normally present in the
cytoplasm 33 34 35 . Cytoplasmic TDP-43 is associated with mitochondria but
there is also evidence linking it with the ER 35 36 37 38 39 . Indeed, several recent studies have linked TDP-43 toxicity with damage to
mitochondria 26 28 35 40 and ER stress signalling
pathways 36 37 38 39 . Together, these findings suggest
that the ER–mitochondria axis may be perturbed by TDP-43.

In support of this notion, we show here that overexpression of wild-type and mutant
TDP-43 reduce
ER–mitochondria interactions, and that these reductions are associated
with decreased binding of VAPB to
PTPIP51. We also demonstrate
that TDP-43 increases cytosolic
Ca 2+ and decreases mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels
following IP3R-mediated Ca 2+ release from ER stores, which is
consistent with a decrease in ER–mitochondria associations 20 . Our findings that overexpression of wild-type as well as mutant
TDP-43 affects
ER-mitochondria associations, the VAPB-PTPIP51
interaction and associated Ca 2+ homeostasis are consistent with many
studies which show that wild-type as well as mutant TDP-43 all induce similar, aggressive forms
of disease in transgenic mice and in other models (for example, refs 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 41 ). Thus, ER–mitochondria and
VAPB–PTPIP51 interactions may be targets for
damage by TDP-43. The precise
mechanisms underlying this damage are not clear. However, in agreement with previous
studies we show that overexpression of TDP-43 activates GSK-3β a kinase strongly implicated in both ALS and
dementia 30 42 43 . Moreover, we demonstrate that
modulating GSK-3β
activity affects the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction; inhibiting GSK-3β increased, whereas
overexpression of GSK-3β decreased binding of VAPB to PTPIP51. Thus, the effect of TDP-43 on the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction may involve activation of GSK-3β, which then leads to
decreased VAPB–PTPIP51 binding. This may be via direct phosphorylation of
VAPB or PTPIP51 by GSK-3β to inhibit their binding,
or signalling via GSK-3β to downstream effectors that somehow influences
VAPB/PTPIP51 phosphorylation and/or binding.
Future studies to tackle this will involve mass spectrometric sequencing of
VAPB and PTPIP51 to identify any GSK-3β phosphorylation sites, and
the analyses of their function using mutagenic approaches.

Disruptions to a number of physiological processes are seen in both ALS and FTD.
These include damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial ATP production, disruption to
Ca 2+ homeostasis, perturbation to axonal transport of
mitochondria, damage to autophagy and finally damage to the ER including activation
of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (see review (ref. 44 )). One conundrum is how so many apparently disparate pathological
features might link together in a common disease pathway. However, all of these
features are regulated by ER–mitochondria associations. Thus
ER–mitochondrial Ca 2+ exchange following release from ER
stores affects both cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial
ATP production since several
mitochondrial dehyrogenase enzymes involved in ATP synthesis are Ca 2+ regulated 4 45 . Decreased mitochondrial ATP production is a feature of at least
some forms of ALS and FTD 46 . Likewise,
ER–mitochondria associations are linked to axonal transport. Mitochondria
are anterogradely transported through axons on kinesin-1 motors and attach to
kinesin-1 via the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Miro, which acts as a
Ca 2+ sensor; elevated Ca 2+ levels disrupt
transport 47 . Recently, Miro has been shown to localize to
ER–mitochondria contact sites and a proportion of ER has been shown to be
co-transported with mitochondria 48 49 . Also, defects in
autophagy are features of ALS/FTD involving TDP-43; autophagosomes are now known to form at
ER–mitochondria contacts 7 50 51 . Finally,
ER–mitochondria associations impact on ER stress and the UPR since a
number of ER chaperones involved in protein folding localize to MAM and structural
uncoupling of ER from mitochondria induces ER stress and ER-UPR 3 52 . Indeed, VAPB itself is
linked to the UPR (see review (ref. 53 )). Thus, the
TDP-43 loosening of
ER–mitochondria associations that we described here may contribute to
some of the pathological features of ALS/FTD.

Several recent studies have implicated defective ER–mitochondria
signalling in some related neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases 11 12 13 14 15 54 . Damage to the ER–mitochondria
axis may thus be a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. The results
described here, which show that VAPB and PTPIP51 function to mediate ER–mitochondria
associations and which demonstrate that the VAPB–PTPIP51 interaction is disrupted by TDP-43, will facilitate future studies on
the role of ER–mitochondria associations in neurodegenerative
diseases.

Rat and rabbit antibodies to VAPB and PTPIP51 were generated by immunization with
GST-VAPB(1–220) and GST-PTPIP51(36–470),
respectively 20 . Rabbit anti-PTPIP51 was from Atlas, rabbit

peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit and anti-rat Igs (GE
Healthcare), and Alexa fluorophore (350, 488 and 568)-coupled goat anti-mouse
and anti-rabbit IgGs (Invitrogen). AR-A014418 and CT99021 were from Abcam and Cayman, respectively.

NSC34 cells were provided by Professor Dame Pamela Shaw, (University of
Sheffield, UK). CV1 and HEK293 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum supplemented with 2 mM glutamine. NSC34 and HEK293 cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); CV1 cells were transfected
using Exgen (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfected cells were analysed 36 h post transfection; siRNA-treated
cells were analysed 4 days post treatment. For fluorescence-activated flow
cytometry cell sorting, NSC34 were trypsinized, resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then sorted for ECFP and EGFP expression
using a BD FACSAria cell sorter, re-plated and cultured for a further
16 h before processing.

For EM, NSC34 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.2) for 3 h and then harvested by scraping gently with a plastic
scraper. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g (av) for
10 min, washed in buffer and post-fixed for 1 h in 1%
osmium tetroxide in
0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. The cells were then stained for
1 h with 1% uranyl
acetate in water before dehydration and embedding in Taab
resin. Spinal cords from 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused mice were immersed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in alcohol
and propylene oxide and
finally infiltrated and embedded in Epon 812 (ref. 26 ). Samples were viewed on a Tecnai 12 electron microscope at
6,800 or 23,000 magnification. Digital images were acquired and the
circumference of each mitochondria and the proportions of the mitochondrial
surface (circumference) closely associated (<30 nm) with ER
were calculated. Cells were randomly selected for analyses without prior
knowledge of transfected plasmid, siRNA or mouse genotype. All clearly
identified mitochondria in the samples were scored. Image analyses were
performed using Adobe Illustrator and ImageJ.

For immunostaining of CV1 cells, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1%
glutaraldehyde in PBS,
quenched in 0.05 M ammonium
chloride in PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in
PBS. Following blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, samples were
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, washed with PBS
and incubated with secondary antibodies. Following washing, the samples were
mounted in Mowiol-DABCO mounting medium containing 10% (w/v) Mowiol
4–88 (Calbiochem), 25% (w/v) glycerol and 2.5% (w/v) DABCO (1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in 100 mM
Tris–HCl pH
8.5. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510Meta confocal microscope equipped
with a × 63 Plan-Apochromat 1.4 NA objective and analysed using ImageJ
with the ICA plug-in 57 . Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism.

Cells were harvested for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by scraping into
SDS–PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue and protease
inhibitors (Complete Roche) in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8 and heating
to 100 °C for 5 min 57 . For
immunoprecipitation assays, transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in ice-cold
immunoprecipitation buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-citrate pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 5 mM ethylene
glycol tetraacetic acid, 5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors (Complete,
Roche) for 30 min. Transgenic mouse samples were homogenized and
diluted into the same buffer. NSC34 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing
25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (Complete
Roche). The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 g for
20 min and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and
precleared by incubation with Protein-G-sepharose beads (prepared as a 50%
slurry in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100). Following centrifugation at
2,000 g for 30 s to settle the beads,
supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and protein concentrations
determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The protein concentrations were
adjusted to
1 μg μl −1 ,
and 500 μg protein incubated with appropriate primary
antibodies on a rotary shaker for 16 h at 4 °C.
Antibodies were then captured by addition of 30 μl
Protein-G-sepharose beads (50% slurry in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100). Following
washing in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, bound proteins were prepared for
SDS–PAGE by addition of 50 μl SDS-PAGE sample
buffer and heating to 100 °C. Signals on immunoblots were
quantified using ImageJ after scanning with an Epson Precision V700 Photo
scanner essentially as described by us in previous studies 57 . To ensure the signals obtained were within the linear range, the mean
background-corrected optical density (OD) of each signal was interpolated for an
OD calibration curve created using a calibrated OD step tablet (Kodak). Only
film exposures that gave OD signals within the linear range of the OD
calibration curve were used for the statistical analyses.

GST, GST-VAPB and
GST-PTPIP51 fusion
proteins were prepared on glutathione-sepharose beads from E. coli BL21(DE3) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE
Healthcare). For cellular pull-down assays, GST and GST fusion proteins were
incubated with transfected cell lysates prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer
as described above 58 . For in vitro pull-down assays
of recombinant VAPB and
PTPIP51, the cytoplasmic
domain of PTPIP51
(aa36–470), was prepared as a GST fusion protein and PTPIP51(36–470) released
from the GST moiety by incubating GST-PTPIP51(36–470) bound to glutathione-sepharose
beads with 1 μg factor XA protease in
50 μl buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl,
2 mM CaCl 2 for 16 h at
4 °C according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (New England Biolabs). 50 μg of purified
recombinant PTPIP51(36-470)
was then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with either
GST or GST-VAPB(1–220) fusion proteins on glutathione-sepharose
beads in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. GST-fusion protein complexes were
pelleted and washed three times with incubation buffer by centrifugation at
2,000 g for 30 s, and analysed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting as described above.

Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels were measured following
IP3R-mediated release from ER stores in HEK293 cells 20 . To
do so, cells transfected with M3R and either empty vector control plasmid or TDP-43 plasmids were loaded with either
2 μM Fluo4-AM or Rhod2-AM dye (Invitrogen) in external solution
(145 mM NaCl,
2 mM KCl,
5 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 mM
CaCl 2 ,
10 mM glucose and
10 mM Na-HEPES pH
7.25) containing 0.02% Pluronic-F27 (Invitrogen) for 15 min at
37 °C, followed by washing in external solution for
15 min. Fluo4 and
Rhod2 fluorescence were
timelapse recorded (1-s intervals) with MetaMorph (Molecular Dynamics) on an
Axiovert S100 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with appropriate filtersets (Chroma
Technology), a × 40/1.3NA Plan-Neofluar objective (Zeiss) and a
Photometrics Cascade-II 512B EMCCD. The cells were kept under constant perfusion
with external solution
(0.5 ml min −1 ).
IP3R-mediated Ca 2+ release from ER stores was triggered by
application of 100 μM Oxotremorine-M (Tocris) for 2 min.
Ca 2+ levels were calculated as relative Fluo4 or Rhod2 fluorescence compared with
baseline fluorescence at the start of the measurement.
