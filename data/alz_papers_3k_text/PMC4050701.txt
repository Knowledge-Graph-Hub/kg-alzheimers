# Title
Rare coding variants inPhospholipase D3 (PLD3)confer risk for Alzheimer's disease

# Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk
variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) 1 , 2 . These
common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do
not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected
by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on
risk. To identify low frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk,
we performed whole exome-sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and
follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large case-control
datasets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase-D family,
member 3, rs145999145; V232M) segregated with disease status in two independent
families and doubled risk for AD in seven independent case-control series (V232M
meta-analysis; OR= 2.10, CI=1.47-2.99; p= 2.93×10 -5 , 11,354
cases and controls of European-descent). Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387
cases and controls of European-descent and 302 African American cases and
controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, indicate that
several variants in this gene increase risk for AD in both populations (EA: OR=
2.75, CI=2.05-3.68; p=1.44×10 -11 , AA: OR= 5.48, CI=1.77-16.92;
p=1.40×10 -3 ). PLD3 is highly expressed in
brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and
is expressed at lower levels in neurons from AD brains compared to control
brains (p=8.10×10 -10 ). Over-expression of PLD3 leads to a
significant decrease in intracellular APP and extracellular Aβ42 and
Aβ40, while knock-down of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in
extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40. Together, our genetic and functional
data indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a
two-fold increased risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP
processing. This study provides an example of how densely affected families may
be used to identify rare variants with large effects on risk for disease or
other complex traits.

## METHODS
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Washington University School of
Medicine in Saint Louis approved the study. Written informed consent was
obtained from participants and their family members by the Clinical Core of the
Knight ADRC. The approval number for the Knight ADRC Genetics Core is
93-0006.

The Knight ADRC sample includes 1,114 late-onset AD (LOAD) cases and 913
cognitively normal controls (377 older than 70yrs), matched for age, gender and
ethnicity, European descent and 302 African-American AD cases and controls.
These individuals were evaluated by Clinical Core personnel of the Knight ADRC
at Washington University. Cases received a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia in
accordance with standard criteria, dementia severity was determined using the
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 28 . 2,027 individuals were of European descent, and 302 were
African-American.

Cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) dataset : A subset
(n=528) of the Knight-ADRC samples had CSF tau and Aβ42 levels. Of these
528, 303 were non-demented (CDR=0) elderly (Age>65) individuals with high
CSF Aβ42 levels (>500 pg/ml). A description of the CSF dataset
used in this study can be found in Cruchaga et al 11 . CSF collection and Aβ 42 ,
tau and ptau181 measurements were performed as described previously 29 .

Participants from the National Institute of Aging Late Onset Alzheimer
Disease Family Study (NIA-LOAD Family Study) included a single demented
individual from each of 868 families with at least three AD-affected individuals
and 881 unrelated nondemented elderly controls (545 older than 70). All AD cases
were diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) using criteria
equivalent to the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders
and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)
for probable AD 30 . NIALOAD
families were ascertained based on the following criteria: Probands were
required to have a diagnosis of definite or probable late-onset AD (onset
>60yrs) and a sibling with definite, probable or possible late-onset AD
with a similar age at onset. A third biologically-related family member (first,
second or third degree) was also required, regardless of affection status. This
individual had to be ≥60 years of age if unaffected, or ≥50 years
of age if diagnosed with LOAD or mild cognitive impairment 12 . Within each pedigree, we
selected a single individual for the case control series by identifying the
youngest affected family member with the most definitive diagnosis (i.e.
individuals with autopsy confirmation were chosen over those with clinical
diagnosis only). Unrelated nondemented controls used for the NIALOAD case
control series had no family history of AD and were matched to the cases as
previously described 12 . Only
individuals of European descent based on the PCs were included. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by local
IRB committees.

The Scripps Translational Science Institute's Wellderly study has
recruited more than 1000 healthy-aged participants. Inclusion criteria specify
informed consent, age > 80 years, blood or saliva donation, compliance
with protocol-specified procedures, and no/mild aging-related medical
conditions. Exclusion criteria includes self-reported cancer (excluding basal
and squamous cell skin cancer), coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction,
stroke/TIA, DVT/PE, CRF/hemodialysis, Alzheimer's/Parkinson's disease, diabetes,
aortic/cerebral aneurysm, or the use of oral chemotherapeutic agents,
anti-platelet agents (excluding aspirin), cholinesterase inhibitors for
Alzheimer's disease, or insulin. All genotyped individuals were of European
descent.

The Cache County Study was initiated in 1994 to investigate the
association of APOE genotype and environmental exposures on
cognitive function and dementia. A cohort comprised of 5,092 Cache County, Utah,
residents (90% of those aged 65 or older) has been followed continually for over
fifteen years, completing four triennial waves of data collection including
clinical assessments (Breitner et al 1999). Genotypes were obtained for 255
demented individuals and 2471 elderly cognitively normal individuals 13 . All individuals genotyped
were of European descent.

A description of the UK-NIA dataset can be found in Guerreiro et al.,
2013 7 . Briefly, this
dataset includes WES from 143 AD cases and 183 elderly nondemented controls. All
subjects were of European descent.

The PLD3 V232M variant was genotyped in 2,211 subjects including 1,253
AD cases (62.6% females) and 958 elderly nondemented controls (64.3% females). A
complete description of the dataset can be found in Kamboh et al. 14 All samples were of European
descent.

The Toronto dataset was composed of 269 unrelated AD cases (53% females)
and 250 unrelated non-demented controls (56% females) of European descent. The
mean (SD) age at onset of AD was 73 (+/-8) years, and the mean (SD) age at last
examination of the controls was 73 (+/-10) years. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of Toronto.

Enrichment of coding exons and flanking intronic regions was performed
using a solution hybrid selection method with the SureSelect® human all
exon 50Mb kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) following the
manufacturer's standard protocol. This step was performed by the Genome
Technology Access Center at Washington University in St Louis. The captured DNA
was sequenced by paired-end reads on the HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina, San
Diego, California). Raw sequence reads were aligned to the reference genome hg19
using Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Selangor, Malaysia). Base/SNP calling
was performed by SNP Samtools. SNP annotation was carried out using version 5.07
of SeattleSeq Annotation server (see URL) 21 .

On average, 95% of the exome had >eight-fold coverage. SNP calls
were made using SAM tools 31 .
SNPs identified with a quality score lower than 20 and a depth of coverage lower
than 5 were removed. More than 2,500 novel variants in the coding region were
found per individual. We identified all variants shared by the affected
individuals in a family. Variants not present in 1,000 genome project or the
Exome Variant Server (EVS: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/ ) or with a frequency lower
than 0.5% in the EVS were selected. On average, 80 coding variants were selected
for each family. The selected variants were then genotyped in the remaining
sampled family members. We validated >98% of the selected variants,
confirming the high specificity of our exome-sequencing method and analysis. On
average, we genotyped a total of 13 family members (7 cases and 6 controls) per
family.

SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate, Sequenom, Kaspar
and/or Taqman genotyping technologies. Only SNPs with a genotyping call rate
higher than 98% and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were used in the analyses. The
principle of the MassARRAY system is PCR-based where different size products are
analyzed by SEQUENOM MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry 22 , 32 . The
KBioscience Competitive Allele-Specific PCR genotyping system (KASP) is
FRET-based endpoint-genotyping technology, v4.0 SNP (KBioscience) 22 , 32 . Genotype call rates were >98%.

PLD3 was sequenced in 2,363 cases and 2,027 controls of European origin,
and 130 cases and 172 controls of African-American descent using a pooled-DNA
sequencing design as described previously 9 , 24 , 33 . Briefly, equimolar amounts of
individual DNA samples were pooled together following quantification using the
Quant-iT™ PicoGreen reagent. Pools contained 100 ng of DNA/individual
from 94 individuals. The coding exons and flanking regions (a minimum of 50 bp
each side) were individually PCR amplified using specific primers and Pfu Ultra
high-fidelity polymerase (Stratagene). An average of 20 diploid genomes
(approximately 0.14 ng DNA) per individual were used as input. PCR products were
cleaned using QIAquick PCR purification kits, quantified using Quant-iT
PicoGreen reagent and ligated in equimolar amounts using T4 Ligase and T4
Polynucleotide Kinase. After ligation, concatenated PCR products were randomly
sheared by sonication and prepared for sequencing on an Illumina HighSeq2000
according to the manufacturer's specifications. pCMV6-XL5 amplicon (1908 base
pairs) was included in the reaction as a negative control. As positive controls,
ten different constructs (p53 gene) with synthetically engineered mutations at a
relative frequency of one mutated copy per 188 normal copies was amplified and
pooled with the PCR products.

Paired-end reads (101 bp) were aligned to the human genome reference
assembly build 36.1 (hg19) using SPLINTER 33 . SPLINTER uses the positive control to estimate
sensitivity and specificity for variant calling. The wild type: mutant ratio in
the positive control is similar to the relative frequency expected for a single
mutation in one pool (1 chromosome mutated in 94 samples= 1/188). SPLINTER uses
the negative control (first 900bp) to model the errors across the 101-bp
Illumina reads and to create an error model from each sequencing run. Based on
the error model SPLINTER calculates a p-value for the probability that a
predicted variant is a true positive. A p-value at which all mutants in the
positive controls were identified was defined as the cut-off value for the best
sensitivity and specificity. All mutants included as part of the amplified
positive control vector were found upon achieving >30-fold coverage at
mutated sites (sensitivity = 100%) and only ~80 sites in the 1908 bp
negative control vector were predicted to be polymorphic (specificity =
~95%). The variants with a p-value below this cut-off value were
considered for follow-up genotyping confirmation. All rare missense or splice
site variants were then validated by Sequenom and KASPar genotyping in each
individual included in the pools. In order to avoid any batch/plate effects,
cases and controls were included in each genotyping plate and all genotyping was
performed in a single experiment. Finally, in order to confirm all of the
heterozygous calls, we created a custom DNA plate including all of the
heterozygotes (cases and controls) for all of the variants, and then genotyped
them again by Sequenom, creating a new Sequenom set.

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer's protocol from 82 AD cases and 39 non-demented individuals.
Extracted RNA was treated with DNase1 to remove any potential DNA contamination.
cDNAs were prepared from the total RNA, using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit
(ABI). Gene expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR, using an ABI-7900
real-time PCR system. The PLD3-A442A variant was genotyped in DNA extracted from
parietal lobe of 82 AD cases and 39 non-demented individuals by Kaspar as
explained below. A total of eight carriers for the A442A variant were
identified.

Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, using an ABI-7500
real-time PCR system. TaqMan assays were used to quantify PLD3 mRNA levels. Primers and TaqMan probe for the
reference gene, GAPDH, were designed over exon-exon
boundaries, using Primer Express software, Version 3 (ABI) (sequences
available on request). Cyclophilin A (ABI: 4326316E) was also used as a
reference gene. Each real-time PCR run included within-plate triplicates and
each experiment was performed, at least twice for each sample.

We selected eight A442A carriers as well as eight CDR, age, APOE and PMI matched individuals to analyze the
expression level of exon 11 containing transcripts, the exon in which the
A442A variant is located. Real-time PCR assays were used to quantify PLD3
exon 7 (forward primer: GCAGCTCCATCCCATCAACT; reverse:
CTTGGTTGTAGCGGGTGTCA), exon 8 (forward primer: CTCAACGTGGTGGACAATGC;
reverse: AGTGGGCAGGTAGTTCATGACA), 9 (forward primer: ACGAGCGTGGCGTCAAG;
reverse: CATGGATGGCTCCGAGTGT), 10 (forward primer: GGTCCCCGCGGATGA; reverse:
GGTTGACACGGGCATATGG) and 11 (first pair of primers: forward primer:
CCAGCTGGAGGCCATTTTC; reverse: TGTCAAGGTCATGGCTGTAAGG; second pair forward
primer: GCTGCTGGTGACGCAGAAT; reverse: AGTCCCAGTCCCTCAGGAAAA). Two pairs of
primers were designed for exon 11 as an internal control. Sybr-green primers
were designed using Primer Express software, Version 3 (ABI). Each real-time
PCR run included within-plate duplicates and each experiment was performed,
at least twice for each sample. Real-time data were analyzed using the
comparative Ct method. Only samples with a standard error of <0.15%
were analyzed. The Ct values for exon 11 were normalized with the Ct value
for the exons 7-10. The relative exon 11 levels for the A442A carriers vs.
the non-carriers were compared using a t-test.

We also used the GEO datasets GSE15222 34 and GSE5281 27 to analyze the association of PLD3 gene expression and case-control status. In the
GSE15222 dataset, there are genotype and expression data from 486 late onset
Alzheimer's Disease cases and 279 neuropathologically clean non-demented
individuals. In the GSE5281 dataset, samples were laser-captured from cortical
regions of 16 normal elderly humans (10 males and 4 females) and from 33 AD
cases (15 males and 18 females). Mean age of cases and controls was 80 years.
All samples were run on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. RNA data were
re-normalized to an average expression of 8 units on a log2 scale. As potential
covariates we analyzed brain region, gender, and age for each sample. Stepwise
discriminant analysis was used to identify the potential covariates to be
included in the ANCOVA. For this dataset we also extracted the gene expression
levels for APP (probe 211277_x_at), PSEN1 (1559206_at), and PSEN2 (203460_s_at) to examine the
correlation between PLD3 and APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 using the Pearson correlation method.

Quantification and analysis of PLD3 gene expression in
brains was performed as previously described 35 . Briefly, the human data used here were provided by the
UK Human Brain Expression Consortium 35 and consisted of 101 control post-mortem brains. All
samples originated from individuals with no significant neurological history or
neuropathological abnormality and were collected by the MRC Edinburgh Brain
Bank 36 ensuring a
consistent dissection protocol and sample handling procedure. A summary of the
available demographic details of these samples including a thorough analysis of
their effects on array quality is provided by Trabzuni et al 37 . All samples had fully
informed consent for retrieval and were authorized for ethically approved
scientific investigation (Research Ethics Committee number 10/H0716/3). Total
RNA was isolated from human post-mortem brain tissues using the miRNeasy 96 well
kit (Qiagen, UK). The quality of total RNA was evaluated by the 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent, UK) and RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent, UK) before processing with the
Ambion® WT Expression Kit and Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense
Target Labeling Assay and hybridization to the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST. All
arrays were pre-processed using Robust Multi-array Average using Partek Genomics
Suite v6.6 (Partek Incorporated, USA). The resulting expression data was
corrected for individual effects (within which are nested postmortem interval,
brain pH, sex, age at death and cause of death) and experimental batch effects
(date of hybridization). Transcript-level expression was calculated for 26,993
genes using Winsorized means (Winsorizing the data below 10% and above 90%).

To evaluate the biological and functional relevance of co-expressed
genes within the PLD3 -containing modules, we used Weighted Gene
Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) 15 and DAVID v6.7 ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ ), the database for annotation,
visualization and integrated discovery 38 . We restricted WGCNA to 15,409 transcripts that passed
the Detection Above Background (DABG) criteria (p-value < 0.001 in at
least 50% of samples in at least one brain region), had a coefficient of
variation > 5% and expression values exceeding 5 in all samples in at
least one brain region. We followed a step-by-step network construction and
module detection. In short, for each brain region, the Pearson correlations
between all genes across all relevant samples were derived. We then calculated a
signed-weighted co-expression adjacency matrix, allowing us to keep track of the
direction of the correlation. A power 12, the default soft threshold parameter
for constructing a signed-weighted Network 39 was used in all brain regions, after checking that it
recapitulated scale-free topology 40 . Topological overlap (TO), a more biologically meaningful
measure of node interconnectedness (similarity) 9 , 24 , was
subsequently calculated and genes were hierarchically clustered using 1 −
TO as the distance measure. Finally modules were determined by using a dynamic
tree-cutting algorithm. WGCNA led to the identification of several co-expression
modules, ranging in number and size between the ten brain regions. We examined
the over-representation (i.e. enrichment) of the three Gene Ontology (GO)
categories (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function)
and KEGG pathways for each list of co-expressed genes with PLD3 for each tissue by comparing numbers of significant genes annotated with this
biological category with chance.

All of the single SNP analyses were performed using a Fisher's exact
test, with no covariates included. Allelic association with risk for AD was
tested using “proc logistic” in SAS including APOE
genotype , age, PCs and study as covariates when available. Odds
ratios with 95% confidence intervals and relative risks (RR) were calculated for
the alternative allele compared to the most common allele using SAS. Association
with age at onset (AAO) was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and tested
for significant differences, using a proportional hazards model (proc PHREG,
SAS) including gender and study as covariates. Non-demented controls were
included in the analyses as censored data. The inclusion of these samples did
not change the association. Gene-based analyses were performed using the optimal
SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O) 26 .

We calculated the PAR using the RR obtained in the study and the MAF
from the EVS database ( http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/ ) and in the Cache-County
dataset, which is a population-based dataset, using the equation: P A R = P e ( R R e − 1 ) [ 1 + P e ( R R e − 1 ) ] Where P e is the carrier frequency in the population
and RR e is the relative risk for the different variants.

All study procedures were approved by Washington University's Human
Research Protection Office. At autopsy, brain tissue was obtained from
participants according to the protocol of the Knight-ADRC. AD neuropathologic
change was assessed according to the criteria of the National Institute on
Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 41 . Dementia with Lewy bodies was assessed using the
criteria of McKeith et al. (2005) 42 .

The following plasmids were used in this study: pCMV6-XL5 human PLD3
wild-type (Origene), pCS2-myc human APP695 wild-type 43 , pCGN-PLD1b WT 44 and K758R 45 , pCGN-PLD2 WT 46 and K898R 45 , pGFL GFP 47 ,
pGFP-V-RS-PLD3-shRNA-GI548821 (Origene), and pGFP-V-RSScr-shRNA-TR30013
(Origene). A dominant negative mutation (K418R) 19 was introduced into the pCMV6-XL5 human
PLD3 wild-type vector by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeII
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). All constructs were verified by
Sanger sequencing.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK293-T) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
1% L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells were grown in
6-well lysine coated plates. Mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) stably
expressing human APP695 wild-type were cultured in DMEM and Opti-MEM (50:50)
supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 500
ug/mL G418. Upon reaching confluency, cells were transiently transfected
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Culture media were replaced after 24
hours, and cells were incubated for another 24 hours. Conditioned media were
collected, treated with protease inhibitor cocktail and centrifuged at
3000xg at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove cell debris. Cell pellets were
extracted on ice in lysis buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.6, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl,
1%NP40, 0.5% Triton 100x, protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at
14,000xg. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method as described
by the manufacturer (Pierce-Thermo).

To confirm effective knockdown of endogenous mouse PLD3 in mouse
N2A-695 cells, RNA was extracted from cell lysates with an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacture's protocol. Extracted RNA (10ug) was
converted to cDNA by PCR using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase
kit (ABI). Gene expression was analyzed by qPCR using an ABI-7900 Real-Time
PCR system. Taqman Real-Time PCR assays were utilized to quantify expression
for mouse PLD3 (ABI:Mm01171272_m1) and GAPDH (ABI: Hs02758991_g1). Samples were run in
triplicate. To avoid amplication interference, expression asays were run in
separate wells from the housekeeping gene GAPDH . Real-time
data were analyzed by the comparative C T method. Average
C T values for each sample were normalized to the average
C T values for the housekeeping gene GAPDH .
The resulting value was corrected for assay efficiency. Samples with a
standard error of 20% or less were analyzed.

Standard SDS-PAGE was performed in 4-20% Criterion Tris-HCl gels
(Bio-Rad). Samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer prior to
electrophoresis 48 .
Immunoblots were probed with antibodies: PLD3 (Sigma), 9E10 (Sigma), and
β-tubulin (Sigma).

The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured in cell
culture media by sandwich ELISA as described by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen). ELISA values were obtained (pg/mL) and corrected for total
intracellular protein (ug/mL) based on BCA measurements.

Cell lysates were pre-cleared with Protein G beads (Thermo
Scientific). Pre-cleared supernatants were incubated overnight at 4°C
with the antibodies indicated. Supernatant-antibody complexes were then
incubated with Protein G beads at room temperature for 2 h. After washing,
proteins were dissociated from the Protein G beads by incubating the beads
in Laemmli sample buffer 48 supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 95°C for 10 min.

SIFT ( http://sift.jcvi.org/www/SIFT_BLink_submit.html ) and Polyphen
( http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/ ) algorithms were used to
predict the functional effect of the identified variants. To determine the
effect of the A442A variant on splicing we used the ESEfinder ( http://rulai.cshl.edu/tools/ESE ). Multiple Sequence Alignment
was performed by ClustalW2, and the PLD3 orthologues were downloaded from
Ensembl ( http://www.ensembl.org/ ).
