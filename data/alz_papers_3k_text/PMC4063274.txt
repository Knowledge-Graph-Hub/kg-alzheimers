# Title
Isolation of single-base genome-edited human iPS cells without
antibiotic selection

# Abstract
Precise editing of human genomes in pluripotent stem cells by
homology-driven repair of targeted nuclease-induced cleavage has been hindered
by the difficulty of isolating rare clones. We developed an efficient method to
capture rare mutational events, enabling isolation of mutant lines with
single-base substitutions without antibiotic selection. This method facilitates
efficient induction or reversion of mutations associated with human disease in
isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells.

## Online Methods
The sample numbers for the experiments to compare ddPCR and canonical
genotyping PCR ( Supplementary
Fig. 1 ) with the plasmid DNA were technical replicates. Those for the
Surveyor assay and ddPCR experiments in HEK293T cells ( Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ) were
all biological replicates (independent transfections of HEK293T cells). We did
not exclude any samples.

TALEN Targeter ( https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/tutorials/talentargeterupdated ) 20 was used to design the PHOX2B
and the PRKAG2 TALENs. ZiFiT ( http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFiT/ChoiceMenu.aspx ) 21 , 22 was used to design the PKP2 and BAG3 TALENs. TALENs
were constructed using the Voytas laboratory's Golden Gate assembly
system provided through Addgene ( http://www.addgene.org/TALeffector/goldengateV2/ ) 23 except the backbone vector. We
interchangeably used the Goldy 24 and the MR015 (a gift from Drs. M. Porteus and M. Rahdar)
TALEN backbones for the PHOX2B TALENs. We observed that these two backbones had
similar activity in human iPS cells (data not shown). We used the MR015 TALEN
backbone for all other TALENs used in this study. The TALEN target sequences
were aligned against the reference genome by BLAST ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) to ensure that they
were unique sites. We used the NN repeat variable di-residues (RVDs) for all the
TALENs used in this study. For PHOX2B and PKP2, the NN versions are described as
the “strong” TALENs. In addition, we made TALENs in which the
binding sequence was the same, except that the NN RVDs were substituted with NK
RVDs (which induces less frequent recombination 25 , 26 ) to create the “weak” TALENs. For the
individual TALEN target sequences, see Supplementary Table 4 .

For the CRISPR/Cas system, we searched the reference human genome for
unique CRISPR target sites (GN 20 GG) that fit with the Church
laboratory's system provided through Addgene ( http://www.addgene.org/crispr/church/ ) 18 , and found a unique site encompassing
the RBM20 mutation site (GGTCT C GTAGTCCGGTGAGCCGG, where
the underlined C was mutated to A). We followed the guidelines provided through
Addgene to generate the gRNA expression construct.

To design the primers and probes, we used the TaqMan MGB Allelic
Discrimination option in Primer Express 3.0 software (Life Technologies). For
the PHOX2B mutation, the default setting (minimal amplicon size was 50 bp) was
selected, whereas for the PKP2, RBM20, and PRKAG2 mutations, the amplicon size
setting was changed to 100 bp to give optimal probe-primer sequences. For the
BAG3 mutation, we manually designed the primers and probe by following the
instructions of Primer Express 3.0, as the default program did not give us any
candidates. The point mutations were inputted as “SNPs for allelic
discrimination”, and designed custom TaqMan MGB probes were purchased
from Life Technologies. Optimal primer sequences identified by the software were
manually checked to ensure that at least one of the primers would anneal outside
of the donor sequence. Oligonucleotide donors were manually designed to target
the point mutation to the middle of the oligonucleotide sequence. Primers and
oligonucleotide donors that underwent standard desalting purification were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. For sequences of the primers,
probes, and oligonucleotide donors, see Supplementary Table 5 .

HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium with high glucose, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FetalPlex (Gemini Bio-Products) and 50 units/ml
penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). For transfection, 4 x
10 5 or 2 x 10 5 cells were plated into a 12- or 24-well
plate, respectively. One day after plating, the cells were transfected with DNA
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), according to manufacturer's
instructions. For point mutagenesis by TALENs, 400 or 200 ng of each TALEN
vector and 800 or 400 ng of an oligonucleotide donor DNA were transfected per
well in a 12- or 24-well plate, respectively. For point mutagenesis by
CRISPR/Cas, 400 or 200 ng of Cas9 vector, 400 or 200 ng of gRNA vector, and 800
or 400 ng of an oligonucleotide donor DNA were transfected per 12- or 24-well,
respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells 3 days after transfection
with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).

The Surveyor assay was carried out according to manufacturer's
instructions (Transgenomics). Using Lipofectamine 2000, 800 ng or 400 ng of each
TALEN vector was transfected into HEK293T cells plated into a 12- or 24-well
plate, respectively. To PCR-amplify the target genomic regions, we used Phusion
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primers:
PHOX2B FW 5′-CTCCAGCCACCTTCTCCATA-3′, PHOX2B RV
5′-CGCTGAGAAAGCTGAAGGTC-3′, PKP2 FW
5′-CAAACTCAAGAATCTCATGATAACAGAA-3′, PKP2 RV
5′-ACAAACCATCAAACAAACTGTG-3′. The digested DNA fragments were
analyzed by 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The intensities of the
bands were quantified by ImageJ ( http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ ). Quantification of the frequency of NHEJ
was calculated using the formula; 100 x {1 – [1
– a/(a + b)] 1/2 }, where a =
the integrated intensity of both cleavage product bands, and b = the
integrated intensity of the uncleaved PCR product band.

For iPS cells, UCSF Committee on human research #10-02521
approved the study protocol. The human iPS cell lines used in this study were
generated from a healthy male patient, WTC10 and WTC11 27 , using the episomal reprogramming
method 28 . We
successfully applied our ddPCR/sib-selection method to another iPS cell line,
WTB6, which was generated from a healthy female patient using episomal
reprogramming method 28 (data
not shown). Informed consent was obtained for this procedure. iPS cells were
maintained on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in Essential 8 medium (Life
Technologies), which was exchanged every other day. To sparsely populated wells
(i.e., passaged wells), we added 10 μM Y-27632, a Rho-associated kinase
(ROCK) inhibitor (Millipore), to promote cell survival 29 .

For TALEN and donor transfections, we used the Human Stem Cell
Nucleofector Kit-1 and a Nucleofector 2b Device (Lonza). WTC11 was used for the
BAG3 mutagenesis, whereas WTC10 was used for the mutagenesis of other genes.
When cells were 60–70% confluent in six-well plates, the medium
was changed to Essential 8 with 10 μM Y-27632 at least 1 hour before
transfection. The medium was then transferred into a conical tube to be used as
conditioned medium. Cells were washed with 2 ml/well phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and treated with 500 μl/well Accutase (Millipore) at 37°C
for 5–10 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in PBS and counted using a
Countess Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies).

For each transfection, 2 million cells were then transferred into a
conical tube and spun down at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was
aspirated, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl/transfection of Human
Stem Cell Solution 1, and 3 μg of each TALEN vector (10 μg of
each TALEN vector was used only in Supplementary Fig. 6b ) and 6
μg of an oligonucleotide donor were added. The total volume of the DNA
solution was less than 10 μl. The suspension was transferred to a
cuvette and electroporated using program A-23. Conditioned medium (500
μl/transfection) was added to the transfected cells, which were then
transferred to a conical tube with 9.5 ml of conditioned medium. The cells were
plated into a Matrigel-coated 96-well plate using a multichannel
micropipetter.

The composition of the pre-mixtures of allele-specific TaqMan probes and
primers was 5 μM of an allele-specific FAM or VIC TaqMan MGB probe, 18
μM of a forward primer, and 18 μM of a reverse primer in water.
For optimization of the PCR annealing and extension temperatures, we mixed the
following reagents in 1.5 ml tubes: 9 μl water, 12.5 μl 2x ddPCR
Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad), 1.25 μl FAM probe and primer pre-mixture,
1.25 μl VIC probe and primer pre-mixture, and 1 μl 0.5
pg/μl 1:1 plasmid mixture of a wild-type allele and a mutant allele (25
μl total volume). Droplet generation with a QX100 Droplet Generator was
performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad), and
the reaction was transferred into a 96-well PCR plate for standard PCR on a
C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling program conducted was: Step 1: 95°C 10 minutes; Step 2: 94°C 30 seconds; Step 3: 50°C–58 or 60°C gradient 1
minute, go back to Step 2 39 times; Step 4: 98°C 10 minutes.

Step 1: 95°C 10 minutes;

Step 2: 94°C 30 seconds;

Step 3: 50°C–58 or 60°C gradient 1
minute, go back to Step 2 39 times;

Step 4: 98°C 10 minutes.

After the PCR was complete, the droplets were analyzed using a QX100
Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) with the “absolute quantification”
option. We first checked whether a probe set could properly discriminate between
negative, FAM-positive, VIC-positive, and double-positive populations. We then
chose the highest annealing temperature that gave the best separation of the
four distinct populations as the optimal temperature (see also Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The optimal
temperatures differed between different probe-primer sets. For example, for the
PHOX2B mutation shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 , the optimal annealing and extension
temperature was 51°C. For the PKP2-, RBM20-, PRKAG2-, and BAG3-
mutations, the optimal annealing temperatures were 57°C, 57°C,
51°C, and 55°C, respectively (data not shown).

For ddPCR to detect point mutagenesis, we mixed the following reagents
in 0.2 ml PCR 8-tube strips: 9 μl (for HEK293T cells) or 4 μl
(for iPS cells) water, 12.5μl 2x ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad),
1.25 μl FAM probe and primer pre-mixture, 1.25 μl VIC probe and
primer pre-mixture, and 1 μl (for HEK293T cells, 100 ng) or 5 μl
(for iPS cells, 50-150 ng) genomic DNA solution (25 μl total volume).
Droplets were generated, followed by PCR at the optimal temperatures, and the
droplets were analyzed as described for the temperature optimization to
calculated mutant allelic frequencies in a wild-type allelic background. For iPS
cells, a multichannel micropipetter was used to directly transfer genomic DNA
extracted from 96-well plates to reaction mixtures, and then to transfer the
reaction mixtures to a cartridge for droplet generation.

When iPS cells (plated in 96-well plates) were 80–90%
confluent, the cells were washed with 100 μl/well PBS and treated with
30 μl/well Accutase at 37°C for 5–10 minutes. Half of
the detached cells were placed into a 96-well plate for genomic DNA extraction,
and the other half left in the original 96-well plate were frozen at −80
°C for future sib-selection. For genomic DNA extraction, 50 μl
of genomic DNA lysis buffer [10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mM
NaCl, 0.5%N-lauroylsarcosine, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K (added
fresh)] was aliquoted into each well on another 96-well plate. We
transferred 15 μl/well of the cell suspension (in Accutase) to the
96-well plate containing the lysis buffer, and the mixture was combined using a
multichannel micropipetter. The plate was then incubated at 55°C
overnight in a plastic container with a small amount of water (to prevent
drying). Then, 100 μl 75 mM NaCl in ethanol that had been stored at
-80°C was added to each well, the solution was mixed, and the plate was
incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The solution was discarded by
inverting the plate (the DNA remained adhered to the plate), and each well was
washed with 100 μl 70% ethanol twice. The plate was then
air-dried for 30–45 minutes to remove all residual alcohol. After
drying, DNA in each well was dissolved in 30 μl TE buffer, and the DNA
concentration was measured. For most wells, we obtained DNA concentrations of
10–30 ng/μl.

For cell freezing, 75 μl freezing medium [HyClone Fetal
Bovine Serum (Thermo Scientific) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(Sigma)] was added to cells in each well of the 96-well plate and mixed
by pipetting up and down, taking care to avoid creating too many bubbles. Then,
75 μl of mineral oil (Sigma, embryo culture grade) was layered onto the
cell suspension. The 96-well plate was sealed with Parafilm and frozen at
-80°C in a Styrofoam container. When thawing the cells, the plate was
placed in a 37°C CO 2 incubator for 10–15 minutes. The
cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, mixed with 0.5 ml Essential 8
medium with 10 μM Y-27632, and the number of cells was counted using a
Countess Automated Cell Counter. An aliquot of the cell suspension was then
removed and placed into a conical tube containing Essential 8 medium
supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and mixed well. Cells were then plated
into Matrigel-coated 96-well plates at the appropriate cell density.

For sib-selection, cell pools containing mutated cells were plated at a
density of 500 cells/well into a 96-well plate, fed with Essential 8 medium with
10 μM Y-27632 every other day for 6 days, and then fed with Essential 8
every other day for the next 4 days. After culturing cells in these conditions,
they were 80–90% confluent and ready for the next round of
sib-selection or cloning.

The process of thawing a cell pool from which iPS clones were isolated
was the same as described for sib-selection (above). For isolating iPS cell
clones, the cells were plated at limiting dilutions for an average density of
100 cells/well into 96-well plates. The cells were fed with Essential 8 medium
with Y-27632 every other day for 10 days, and then fed with Essential 8 every
other day for the next 8 or 10 days. By 18 or 20 days after plating, cells in
only 10–30% of wells survived. Wells containing cells with
pluripotent morphology that were likely to have been derived from a single clone
were chosen for clonal analyses. We are aware that iPS cells purified via
limiting dilution may be the progeny of more than one cell (mixed colony).
However analysis via ddPCR allowed us to rapidly determine whether a putative
clone is genetically homogenous by quantifying the alleles. After the initial
purification we also frequently recloned cells to be sure that populations are
homogenous (see Genotyping PCR and expansion of isolated clones and Supplementary Fig. 6g ).
These wells were washed in 100 μl/well PBS, and cells were detached with
30 μl/well Accutase. Cells were divided into two even pools for genomic
DNA extraction and freezing as described above, except that the transferred
cells were strategically arranged in wells of new 96-well plates. In this way,
the genomic DNA samples could be readily analyzed by genotyping PCR on a
384-well format, as described below. The concentration of genomic DNA extracted
from the clones was 3–10 ng/μl, which was sufficient for
genotyping PCR. Some investigators prefer cloning human iPS cells on feeder
cells, and this process also works well with our method. However we have found
that using feeder free culture conditions to be more compatible with higher
throughput production and analysis in a 96-well plate format. However it is
essential to confirm homogeneity of the alleles via ddPCR and/or subsequent
subcloning.

The following reagents were mixed in each well of a 384-well plate: 2.5
μl 2x TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Life Technologies), 0.125 μl
FAM probe and primer pre-mixture (the same pre-mixture used for ddPCR), 0.25
μl VIC probe and primer pre-mixture (the same pre-mixture used for
ddPCR), 1.625 μl water, and either 0.5 μl extracted genomic DNA
from iPS clones, 0.5 μl 0.5 pg/μl mutant allele
plasmid/wild-type allele plasmid/1:1 mixture of both plasmids, or 0.5 μl
water (no template control) (5 μl total). We made a master mix of these
reagents, excluding the templates, aliquoted 4.5 μl of the master mix
into each well on a 384-well plate, and added 0.5 μl of each template to
the relevant wells. After mixing, the plate was centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 5
minutes. PCR genotyping was carried out using the Applied Biosystems 7500 or
7900 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) using the SDS2.4 software
(Life Technologies). Plate documents of Allelic Discrimination (AD) and the
Standard Curve (AQ) for the samples were created according to the
manufacturers' instructions. Pre-Read was performed to measure
background signals of each well with the AD plate document, a thermal cycling
was performed with the AQ plate document, and finally Post-Read and genotyping
were done with the AD plate document (according to manufacturer's
instructions). The thermal cycling parameters for the default condition of the
AQ plate document were as follows:

Step 1: 50°C 2 minutes;

Step 2: 95°C 10 minutes;

Step 3: 95°C 15 seconds;

Step 4: 60°C 1 minute, go back to Step 3 39 times.

During thermal cycling, both the FAM and VIC signals were monitored.

The target genomic regions were amplified by conventional PCR with
Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase from the genomic DNA of clones that were
genotyped as positive for mutant alleles, and sequence-verified for the
mutations. The 96-well plates that had the positive clones were then thawed in
the same way as for sib-selection (described above). The cell suspension was
mixed with 0.5 ml Essential 8 medium with 10 μM Y-27632 in a 1.5-ml
tube, and the cells were spun down at 6,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Using a
micropipetter, the surface oil layer followed by the medium was carefully
removed. The cells were then resuspended in Essential 8 medium with 10
μM Y-27632 and plated into Matrigel-coated 6- or 12-well plates. Wells
containing iPS cells that partially differentiated during the cloning step were
passaged at a 1:10 ratio 2–3 times, to remove these cells and recover
pools that are fully pluripotent.

We confirmed that the mutant allele: wild-type allele ratio was 1:1 and
1:0 for heterozygous and homozygous mutant lines, respectively, by ddPCR to
verify that they were pure clones. The results for the PRKAG2-mutant Het are
shown in Supplementary Fig.
6g as an example.

iPS cells cultured in 24-well plates were washed with 500
μl/well PBS, fixed with 250 μl/well 4% paraformaldehyde
at room temperature for 20 minutes, and then washed with 500 μl/well PBS
three times. The cells were blocked and permeabilized with 250 μl/well
PBS with 0.1% Triton-X (PBS-T) supplemented with 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then in 200 μl/well
primary antibodies diluted 200 times in PBS-T with 5% BSA at 4°C
overnight. The primary antibodies (all purchased from Abcam) used in this study
were SOX2 (ab59776), OCT4 (ab19857), SSEA4 (ab16287), and TRA-1-81 (ab16289).
The cells were washed with 500 μl/well PBS-T three times, incubated with
200 μl/well secondary antibodies diluted 500 times in PBS-T with
5% BSA at room temperature for 1 hour, and then washed with 500
μl/well PBS three times. The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor
488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (A-11001) and Alexa Fluor 488 (A-11008) or 594 (A-11012)
Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). Finally, the cells were mounted with
75 μl/well VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (H-1200) (Vector
Laboratories). The pictures were taken by using BZ-9000 microscope
(Keyence).

Karyotyping was carried out by Cell Line Genetics (Madison, WI).

Potential off-target sites for the PHOX2B and PRKAG2 TALENs were
predicted by a recently reported bioinformatic tool, TALENoffer 30 . We set the distance between
two TALEN binding sites from 12 to 24 bp, and other parameters were the default
settings for the prediction. For both TALEN pairs, the top candidates were their
on-targets, indicating that the prediction was properly done. We chose top 10
off-target sites for each TALEN pair and designed primers that amplify
400–1100-bp genomic regions around the off-target sites. The genomic
regions were amplified by using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase from the
PHOX2B-mutant Het, PHOX2B-mutant Homo, PRKAG2-mutant Het, PRKAG2-mutant Het 2,
and Independent PRKAG2-mutant Het lines, as well as the parental iPS cell line,
WTC10. The amplicons were sequenced from both 5′ and 3′ ends by
using the primers that amplified them. All the sequencing results from the
mutant lines were compared to those from WTC10. We did not see any mutations in
the mutant lines (see Supplementary Table 3 for the details).
