Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in Alzheimer’s
disease patients treated with bapineuzumab: A retrospective analysis

# Abstract
Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) have been reported in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients treated with bapineuzumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody to amyloid-β. ARIA includes MRI signal
abnormalities suggestive of vasogenic edema and sulcal effusions (ARIA-E)
and hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). A better understanding of the incidence
and risk factors for ARIA may further the development of amyloid-modifying
treatments for AD. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed (kappa=0.76) and then
reached consensus reads on over 2500 FLAIR-MRIs from 262 participants in
three phase 2 studies of bapineuzumab. Subjects (n=210) were included in
risk analyses if they had no evidence of ARIA-E on pre-treatment MRI,
received bapineuzumab, and had at least one post-treatment MRI. 36/210 (17%) subjects developed ARIA-E during treatment; 28
of these 36 (78%) did not report associated symptoms. Adverse events
reported in 8 symptomatic patients included headache, confusion,
neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. 15/36 of the ARIA-E cases
(42%) were detected only on central review. 13/15 received
additional infusions while ARIA-E was present, without any associated
symptoms reported. ARIA-E incidence increased with bapineuzumab dose (Hazard
Ratio [HR] 2.24 per mg/kg increase in dose; p<0·001) and
with APOE ε4 allele number (HR 2.55 per allele;
p<0·001). ARIA appears to represent a spectrum of imaging findings with
variable clinical correlates, with some cases remaining asymptomatic even
when treated through ARIA-E. The increased risk of ARIA with APOE ε4
and bapineuzumab dose, and the time course in relation to dosing, is
consistent with alterations in vascular amyloid burden.

## Introduction
Immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s disease is an area of active research,
with a number of clinical trials currently investigating active or passive
immunotherapeutic approaches to lower cerebral amyloid-β burden. 1 – 4 Several of these studies have reported treatment-related
abnormalities on brain imaging, but the pathophysiology underlying these changes
remains uncertain. 1 – 4 Furthermore, since these imaging
abnormalities can be clinically silent, their exact incidence and the spectrum of
clinical and imaging features remains unclear.

Imaging abnormalities associated with immunotherapy were first observed in a
phase 1 study of bapineuzumab, 3 a
humanized monoclonal antibody against beta amyloid, and subsequently in the phase 2
bapineuzumab studies. 1 , 2 The MRI abnormalities, seen on T2
weighted/fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were initially
referred to as “vasogenic edema” 4 . As additional cases were identified in subsequent trials,
it became clear that there was a spectrum of imaging alterations associated with
amyloid modifying treatments. A recent expert workgroup suggested the umbrella term:
Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), 5 which includes FLAIR signal abnormalities thought to
represent parenchymal vasogenic edema and sulcal effusions (ARIA-E), as well as
abnormalities detectable on GRE/T2* sequences believed to represent microhemorrhages
and hemosiderosis (ARIA-H).

This report focuses on incident ARIA in the setting of bapineuzumab; however,
its findings may have implications for other anti-amyloid therapies. As the original
protocols for these trials included only local MRI reads, with limited
neuroradiological and clinical experience with these phenomena, there was concern
that some cases of ARIA-E might have been missed. A systematic, central review of
the MRI from all phase 2 studies was therefore undertaken to assess the incidence of
ARIA, its risk factors, and clinical characteristics in the context of bapineuzumab
treatment.

## Methods
A centralized MRI review was conducted on all scans performed during the
completed phase 2 bapineuzumab clinical trials study 201 and study 202, 1 , 2 and the associated ongoing open-label extension study, study 251
prior to February 1, 2009 (see Figure 1 ).
Several procedures were adopted to assure maximal sensitivity for ARIA detection: 1)
two neuroradiologists retrospectively reviewed the scans for each patient with
complete access to prior and future scans within a patient’s MRI series for
comparison; however, they were blinded to the participant’s assigned
therapy, APOE ε4 genotype, medical history, and demographics; 2) the scans
were read independently and in parallel by each reader; and 3) differences between
readings were then discussed and resolved by consensus. Prior to consensus, the
inter-reader kappa was 0.76 with 94% agreement on the presence or absence of
ARIA-E within individual patients.

Study 201 and 202 were multicenter, double-blinded, randomized,
placebo-controlled, ascending-dose cohort trials. 1 , 2 Each lasted for 18
months and included 6 infusions 13 weeks apart. Study 251 is an ongoing extension
study into which eligible study 201 patients were recruited (see Supplementary Material S1 for
more detail on inclusion/exclusion criteria). Patients in study 251 who previously
received bapineuzumab in study 201 were assigned to the same dose of bapineuzumab in
study 251 (n=80), and those who previously received placebo in study 201 (n=79)
received the dose level of the cohort to which they were originally assigned. No
participants from study 202 enrolled in study 251. MRI scans were performed prior to
the first infusion and 6 weeks after each subsequent infusion in all studies.

Subjects were identified with incident ARIA-E if they developed new
parenchymal or sulcal hyperintensities on FLAIR MRI, consistent with extravascular
fluid in the absence of other pathologies. Parenchymal hyperintensities were
recorded as present or absent for the posterior fossa and for the left and right
side in each of 5 regions (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and basal
ganglia); in addition, the overall presence or absence of sulcal hyperintensities
was assessed. The total number of regions with ARIA-E was calculated.
Microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) were also noted as present or absent in the same regions
on the T2* images. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were assessed using an
adapted 4-point scale: 6 0 (none), 1
(focal lesions), 2 (beginning of confluent lesions), and 3 (diffuse involvement).
For the risk analyses, WMH levels 0 and 1 were combined, as were levels 2 and 3, in
order to determine whether higher-grade white matter hyperintensity (ie, more severe
vascular pathology) 7 was associated
with ARIA-E.

The sample for the risk analyses included patients treated with bapineuzumab
in studies 201, 202 or 251, with a post-infusion FLAIR-MRI, and no other diagnosed
conditions deemed to be responsible for the observed imaging abnormalities (see
Results section and Figure 1 ). The
patients’ bapineuzumab dose was defined as the highest dose received during
the study. Subjects identified with ARIA-E were classified as to whether ARIA was
first identified during the course of the trial or during the MRI re-read study, and
as either symptomatic or asymptomatic. A subject was considered symptomatic if one
or more symptoms were reported as either related or possibly related to study drug
in the ARIA safety report from the study investigator.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to examine the distribution of
incident ARIA-E from start of treatment among different groups. Cox proportional
hazards (PH) models were used to explore risk factors. SAS release 9.1 was used for
all statistical analyses. The PH assumption was evaluated by examining log, negative
log plots, with no observed violations. Sensitivity analyses of the PH models
performed with a truncated follow-up time found similar results ( Supplementary Material S2 ).
P-value significance thresholds were not pre-specified nor adjusted for
multiplicity.

Research & Development, LLC. and Pfizer Inc.) were involved in the study
design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, as well as in the
development and submission of this manuscript. All authors had access to the
study data and shared responsibility for submitting the manuscript for

## Results
Among 262 study participants in studies 201, 202, or 251 ( Figure 1 ), 223 patients were treated with
bapineuzumab and 2572 MRI scans were reviewed. Two ARIA-E cases were detected among
the 262 patients (0.8%) at screening, both of which were subsequently
treated with bapineuzumab, and 11 patients lacking a post-infusion FLAIR MRI were
excluded. The analyzable sample for bapineuzumab-associated ARIA-E risk factors was
thus restricted to 210 participants. One patient identified with possible ARIA-E
during the MRI review was subsequently diagnosed with brain metastases and
considered to not have bapineuzumabassociated ARIA. Another ARIA-E case was detected
among 118 patients (0.8%) treated with placebo.

The incidence rate of ARIA-E was 17.1% (36/210) among
bapineuzumab-treated subjects. Figure 2 illustrates the range of ARIA observed in this study. ARIA-E manifested as increased
signal in the white or gray matter parenchyma and/or within sulcal spaces on the
FLAIR-MRI sequence, whereas ARIA-H was detected on GRE/T2* weighted sequences. The
baseline prevalence rate of microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) was 9.2% (19/207; Table 1 ). Incident ARIA-H was observed in 17/36
(47.2%) of the ARIA-E cases compared with 7/177 (4.0%) subjects
without ARIA-E. Among the 17/36 ARIA-E patients with incident ARIA-H, 14 had ARIA-H
noted either on the scan immediately prior (2), coincident with (6) or immediately
following (6) the scan in which ARIA-E was first noted. Eight of these 14 had ARIA-H
detected in the same region as ARIA-E.

Table 1 presents selected risk
factors and baseline MRI findings for subjects included in the risk factor analysis.
Baseline characteristics were similar for subjects with ARIA-E versus those without,
with the exception that the incidence rate of ARIA increased with bapineuzumab dose
and number of APOE ε4 alleles. The respective HRs were 2.24 per mg/kg
increase in dose and 2.55 per additional APOE ε4 allele. Additional PH
models predictive of ARIA-E are shown in Table
2 . For bapineuzumab dose, the HRs exceeded 3.0 for the 2 highest doses
when compared with the lowest dose. Similarly, the HRs were approximately 3-fold
higher in ε4 heterozygotes and 7-fold higher in ε4 homozygotes
compared with ε4 non-carriers. There was no increase in HR for small
hemosiderin deposits or white matter hyperintensities on baseline MRI. Models for
age, gender, baseline MMSE, Hamilton Depression rating scale score, Rosen-Modified
Hachinski score, history of cerebrovascular disease, and hypertension were also not
predictive of ARIA-E. Figure 3 presents
Kaplan-Meier plots for ARIA-E by dose, APOE ε4 allele frequency, and the
presence of small hemosiderin deposits at baseline. A dose-related increase in
ARIA-E risk was observed with an increased risk of ARIA-E for the 2 mg/kg dose,
particularly notable after the first dose. APOE ε4 allele number showed a
clear separation early that persisted with continued follow-up.

The mean number of infusions prior to identification of ARIA-E was 2.4
(S.D.=1.7; range 1 to 7). The majority of ARIA-E cases (25/36; 69%) were
identified after the first or second infusion. ARIA-E was not observed beyond 2
years after the first exposure to bapineuzumab. The median duration of ARIA-E for
the 31/36 subjects in whom resolution was demonstrable on follow-up scans was 113
days (range 17 to 534). Eight patients with ARIA-E identified during the trial were
re-dosed at a lower dose after ARIA-E resolved; ARIA-E recurred in one subject who
remained asymptomatic.

Eight of the 36 ARIA-E patients had symptoms (adverse events [AEs]) that
were considered related or possibly related to study drug. The categories for these
AEs were general (n=7, with headache in 4), neurologic (n=16, with confusion in 5),
psychiatric (n=3), and gastrointestinal (n=3) (See Supplementary Material S3 for
additional details). Among the 8 symptomatic patients, 7 were APOE ε4
carriers (5 homozygotes and 2 heterozygotes). Six of the 8 symptomatic cases had
been dosed at 2 mg/kg dose (4), or 1 mg/kg dose (2). In all these cases bapineuzumab
was discontinued, and a follow-up MRI subsequently showed resolution of ARIA-E. One
symptomatic patient in the 251 study developed a left frontal stroke temporally
associated with ARIA-E but did not have focal symptoms clearly referable to either
the location of the stroke or ARIA-E. 8 Although the ARIA-E resolved, the patient eventually expired
∼8 weeks later due to complications of the stroke. Seven patients had
incident microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) without ARIA-E; none of these cases manifested
clinical symptoms.

Fifteen patients were identified with ARIA-E only during the MRI re-read
study. All were asymptomatic and had fewer brain regions involved
(1·3+/− 0·5) versus those identified during the clinical
studies (2·6+/−2·4; p< 0·02). Thirteen of
these 15 received additional infusions of bapineuzumab after ARIA-E first appeared,
as the ARIA was not detected during the trial, and remained asymptomatic. In 2 of
these 13, ARIA-E recurred with additional infusions, but the patients remained
asymptomatic.

Eight out of 36 subjects with ARIA had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected.
Five had a normal CSF profile; 3 had elevated protein (259, 264, 337 mg/dL) and red
cell count (360, 1280, 108 cells/ mm 3 ). Two had an increased number of
white cells (8, 19 cells/mm 3 ), both of whom were symptomatic and APOE
ε4 carriers.

Figure 4 shows a bapineuzumab-treated
subject who developed ARIA at the 2 mg/kg dose in the 202 study. This subject
underwent 11-C Pittsburgh Compound B – position emission tomography (11-C
PIB-PET) amyloid imaging pre- and post-ARIA. The baseline PIB retention was elevated
(consistent with high fibrillar Aβ burden) in several regions in which
ARIA-E and ARIA-H subsequently developed. PiB retention was reduced in these regions
at the follow-up scan after ARIA-E had resolved.

## Discussion
This study involved a centralized, blinded, retrospective assessment of the
incidence of ARIA in bapineuzumab-treated subjects from a series of phase 2 studies.
ARIA was detected in 17% of bapineuzumab-treated subjects who met the
inclusion criteria for the risk analyses. The majority of cases were clinically
silent. Approximately 40% of ARIA cases were first detected in this
retrospective central review, all of whom were asymptomatic and continued to be
dosed while having ARIA-E. In some patients, ARIA recurred, but they remained
asymptomatic. These newly identified ARIA-E cases appeared to have milder FLAIR
signal changes with fewer involved brain regions. When the phase 2 studies started,
little was known about the range of ARIA changes on MRI. With greater awareness of
these phenomena, it seems likely that local radiologists will miss fewer ARIA cases
in the future.

The exact mechanisms giving rise to ARIA remain to be fully elucidated, but
the risk factors identified in this study, as well as recent data from animal
models, give rise to a number of potential theories (see Figure 5 ). The risk analyses provide quantitative evidence for
increased risk of ARIA-E with increasing APOE ε4 allele number, extending a
preliminary report suggesting that the risk of ARIA-E is increased among APOE
ε4 carriers. 1 APOE
ε4 has been linked to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in
transgenic mice. 9 , 10 Postmortem human studies indicate that APOE
ε4 is a risk factor for CAA 11 – 13 and
spontaneous ARIA-E-like phenomena have been reported in CAA patients. 14 , 15 APOE ε4 carrier status is also a risk factor for
microhemorrhage in the general population 16 , 17 and among
patients in memory clinics. 11 , 18 , 19 ARIA-E cases were too few to fully explore an interaction
between APOE ε4 allele and bapineuzumab dose, although the observations that
7/8 symptomatic cases were ε4 carriers and 6/8 were treated at the two
highest doses, is suggestive of a potential interrelationship that remains to be
fully explored in larger studies. The risk factor analyses, together with the latter
findings, suggest that it may be possible to reduce bapineuzumab-related ARIA-E and
associated symptoms by careful dosing with attention to APOE ε4 status.

The presence of baseline ARIA-H was not found to be a significant risk
factor for ARIA-E in this study. However, subjects with multiple baseline
microhemorrhages were excluded from participation in the 251 study due to concern
about a potential link between risk factors for CAA and ARIA-E. Approximately half
of the bapineuzumab-treated subjects who developed ARIA-E also developed incident
ARIA-H, with the majority of these subjects demonstrating evidence of temporal and
spatial co-occurrence. These findings suggest that ARIA-E and ARIA-H are related
phenomena, perhaps both related to increases in vascular permeability. 5 Depending on the location
(intraparenchymal or meningeal) of the vessel, leakage of proteinaceous fluid could
give rise to an increased signal detected on FLAIR images (ARIA-E) in the brain
parenchyma (vasogenic edema) and leptomeningeal spaces (sulcal effusions), while
leakage of red cells would result in ARIA-H, seen on T2*GRE MRI as cerebral
microhemorrhages and hemosiderosis. 5

The increased risk of ARIA associated with higher doses of bapineuzumab, as
well as the illustrative case with PET amyloid imaging, also suggest a potential
relationship of ARIA to amyloid clearance. The reduction of PiB retention,
presumably representing clearance of fibrillar amyloid from both plaque and cerebral
vessels, appeared to be both temporally and regionally associated with vasogenic
edema and microhemorrhage. A recent report in a small number of subjects treated
with gantenerumab, a conformationally specific monoclonal antibody with high
affinity for fibrillar forms of amyloid-β, also demonstrated evidence of
reduced amyloid burden on PiB-PET imaging in two patients who developed
ARIA-E. 4 It is also
possible that ARIA may be related to clearance of amyloid from parenchymal plaques
with a transient increase in vascular or perivascular amyloid burden 20 , 21 or to inflammation. 22 However, similar to reports in transgenic
animals, 23 – 25 eventual normalization of cerebral
blood vessel integrity in humans may be possible. In a post-mortem study of subjects
included in an earlier active amyloid immunization trial (AN1792), two of the
longest treated participants treated showed a virtually complete absence of
CAA. 26 The observation
that the majority of ARIA-E occurred within the first few doses may also support the
hypothesis that vascular remodeling after amyloid clearance may reduce the risk of
ARIA over time.

It appears that ARIA-E can rarely occur spontaneously, as one case was
identified in the placebo group of the 201 study and 2 cases were noted at screening
( Figure 1 ). A recent report identified two
spontaneous ARIA-E cases in large cohorts screened for AD clinical trials with other
agents. 27 Given reports of
similar ARIA findings in CAA patients, 13 , 14 it is possible
that some of these spontaneous ARIA-E cases represent AD patients with concomitant
CAA.

Several potential limitations to our study should be considered. The MRI
review was retrospective, and the results might have been different if scans had
been read prospectively without access to other scan timepoints for comparison. Our
primary intent in having two neuroradiologists assess the scans was to increase the
likelihood of detecting any potential MRI findings consistent with ARIA; hence, we
did not provide extensive training to enhance interreader reliability. Nevertheless,
the inter-reader reliability was reasonably high. As we asked the readers to then
discuss any cases with discrepant reads, we were not able to assess intra-rater
reliability. A more detailed rating scale for both ARIA-E and ARIA-H is under
development, and will be used in future projects with the phase 3 data. We did not
find evidence of associated clinical symptoms in the majority of ARIA cases, but it
is possible that subtle symptoms could be missed in patients with mild to moderate
dementia. Although this study represents the largest collection of treatment-related
ARIA cases to date, given the relatively small numbers of subjects, we are not able
to definitively explore all potential risk factors, which will require further study
in larger trials.

In summary, our results suggest that ARIA represents a spectrum of imaging
findings with variable clinical correlates, including a substantial number of subtle
cases that went undetected during the trials and remained asymptomatic despite
continued treatment. The frequent co-occurrence of ARIA-E and ARIA-H suggests a
common pathophysiological mechanism that may be related to transient increases in
vascular permeability. The increased risk of ARIA in APOE ε4 carriers
further supports a key role of vascular amyloid, whereas the relationship to
bapineuzumab dosing and the PiB-PET amyloid results suggests that ARIA may be
related to amyloid clearance. Ongoing studies with bapineuzumab and other potential
amyloid-modifying therapies should shed additional light on the long term
implications of these phenomena.

## Panel: Research in Context
We searched PubMed for articles published in English between Jan 1, 1980
and December 1, 2011 using the search terms “vasogenic edema”,
“amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)”, and
“Alzheimer’s disease.” This search yielded only the
three published reports from the bapineuzumab phase 1 and 2 trials; one report
from another monoclonal antibody, ganteneremab; one recent report of ARIA
detected in screening cohorts for Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials;
and several recent review articles on drug development. A recent workgroup
report also cites published abstracts from other classes of amyloid-modifying
agents, but these data are not yet published. As amyloid-related imaging
abnormalities occurring in Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials represent
a relatively new concept, we broadened our search to include imaging reports
from cerebral amyloid angiopathy cases, which also appear relevant to our
findings.

This is the first systematic study of amyloid-related imaging
abnormalities (ARIA) in the context of amyloid-modifying therapies; in
particular, abnormalities related to MR-signal alterations thought to represent
vasogenic edema (ARIA-E). We identified a number of ARIA-E cases that were
initially missed during the previously reported studies with bapineuzumab, and
reported the clinical symptomatology or lack thereof in all identified ARIA-E
cases. In addition, by combining cases across three Phase 2 studies, we were
able to examine a number of risk factors for developing ARIA-E. The increased
risk of incident ARIA-E with increased number of APOE ε4 alleles, as
well as previous case reports in the literature of similar phenomema occurring
spontaneously in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, suggest a potential relationship
with vascular amyloid burden. The increased risk of ARIA with a higher
bapineuzumab dose and the illustrative case with PET-amyloid imaging, as well as
a similar report in a small number of subjects treated with another monoclonal
antibody, suggest a possible relationship of ARIA-E to beta-amyloid clearance.
Our findings have important implications for elucidating the mechanisms
underlying ARIA, and the continued need for close monitoring of ARIA in the
development of anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.
