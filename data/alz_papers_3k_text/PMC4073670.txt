Structure-Based Design of Non-Natural Amino Acid Inhibitors of Amyloid Fibrillation

# Abstract
Many globular and natively disordered proteins can convert into amyloid fibers. These fibers are associated with numerous pathologies 1 as well as with normal cellular functions 2 , 3 , and frequently form during protein denaturation 4 , 5 . Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibers could serve as leads for therapeutics, provided the inhibitors were specific enough to avoid interfering with normal processes. Here we show that computer-aided, structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors of amyloid formation. Using known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibers as templates, we have designed and characterized an all D-amino acid inhibitor of fibrillation of the tau protein found in Alzheimer’s disease, and a non-natural L-amino acid inhibitor of an amyloid fiber that enhances sexual transmission of HIV. Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibrillation of full-length proteins, including those like tau that lack fully ordered native structures.

## Full Methods
Computational designs were carried out using the RosettaDesign software ( www.rosettacommons.org ) 25 . This algorithm involves building side-chain rotamers of all amino acids onto a fixed protein backbone. The optimal set of rotamers is then identified as those which minimize an energy function containing a Lennard-Jones potential, an orientation-dependent hydrogen bond potential, a solvation term, amino acid-dependent reference energies, and a statistical torsional potential that depends on the backbone and side-chain dihedral angles.

The crystal structure of VQIVYK was used as a starting scaffold for computational design (PDB accession code 2on9) 15 . To take full advantage of the statistical nature of the rotamer library and some terms in the Rosetta energy function, the stereochemistry of the fiber scaffold was inverted so that design would take place using L-amino acids. An extended L-peptide was aligned with the N, C, and O backbone atoms of the D-fiber scaffold. This L-peptide was subsequently redesigned, keeping all atoms of the D-fiber fixed. The stereochemistry of the final design model was then inverted, yielding a D-peptide designed to cap an L-fiber. We inspected the finished models to confirm that inversion of the stereochemistry at the Thr and Ile Cβ atoms did not make the designs energetically unfavorable. Energetic consequences of incorporating a D-blocker peptide in the middle of an L-fiber were subsequently evaluated to ensure that fiber propagation could not continue after association of a blocker. Area buried and shape complementarity calculations were performed with areaimol and sc, respectively 31 , 32 .

The crystal structure of GGVLVN (PDB accession code 3PPD) was used as a template for the following design procedure: An extended L-peptide was aligned according to crystal symmetry. Small random perturbations to the L-peptide were performed to optimize the rigid body arrangement between the fiber template and peptide inhibitor. Full sequence optimization of the blocker was performed using RosettaDesign, allowing residues directly contacting the blocker to repack; other scaffold residues remained fixed. Because the design calculations employ a discrete rotamer representation of the side-chains, we next performed simultaneous quasi-Newton optimization of the blocker rigid body orientation, the side-chain torsion angles, and in some cases, the backbone torsion angles using the full-atom Rosetta energy function. This optimization was essential to the subsequent assessment of the inhibition of the design. Several iterative runs of small perturbation of blocker placement, interface design and refinement were performed to improve hydrogen bonding and packing interactions. The top ranked designs based on the total binding energy of the blocker to the fiber scaffold and the interfacial shape complementarity 32 were subsequently synthesized and tested.

For each initial active L-peptide design, the non-natural L-amino acids were incorporated using a growth strategy. Non-natural amino acids, structurally similar to those of initial active designs, were selected based on their solubility, side-chain shape, and commercial availability. Side-chain conformations were approximately sampled by adopting side-chain torsion angles from those in their natural counterparts. Sequence optimization of the blocker was performed and the optimal set of rotamers identified using Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing with the full-atom energy function described above. The resulting designs were ranked based on the total binding energy of the blocker to the fiber scaffold.

pNG2 expression vectors (derived from pET-3b 33 ) containing either the K12 or K19 gene, were generously provided by E. Mandelkow 34 . Expression in BL21 (DE3) E. coli 33 was induced with 1mM isopropyl thiogalactoside when the Abs 600 was between 0.8 and 1.0 and cells were harvested after 3–4 hours. K12 and K19 were purified based on previously described methods 35 . Cells were pelleted for 20 minutes at 4700 × g, and resuspended in 20 mM MES pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were sonicated for 2.5 minutes and, following addition of NaCl to bring cell lysate to 0.5 M NaCl, the lysate was boiled for 20 minutes. The lysate was sedimented at 30,000 × g for 20 min and dialyzed twice against 20 mM MES pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF at 4°C. The dialysate was pelleted for 20 minutes at 30,000 × g and filtered before cation exchange chromatography on an AKTA Explorer (GE – Pharmacia) with a HighTrap HP SP 5mL column (GE Healthcare). The sample was eluted with a linear gradient of up to 60% Buffer B (20 mM MES pH 6.8, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF). Size exclusion chromatography was optionally performed with a Superdex ™ 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) with 1 mM DTT on the AKTA Explorer depending on preparation purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE.

150 μL reactions containing 50 μM tau K12 or K19, as determined by the micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce), were incubated in 250 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with 1 mM DTT, 12.5 μM of heparin (6000 average molecular weight) from Sigma, and 10 μM Thioflavine S (ThS), from MP Bio, Inc. 36 – 38 . Inhibitor peptides (CS Bio, Inc., Celtek Biosciences, LLC) were dissolved in 250 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 to 0.5 mM and added at specified molar ratios. Reactions were split into a minimum of 3 replicates in black 96-well optically-clear plates (Nunc), sealed with Corning pressure seal tape and monitored using a Varioskan plate reader (Thermo Scientific, Inc) for K12 and a SpectraMax M5 for K19. The fluorescence signal was measured every 15 minutes with excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 and 510 nm, respectively, at 37°C with continuous shaking at 900 rpm with a diameter of 1 mm for K12, and quiescent incubation, with shaking 2 seconds prior to each reading for K19. Plots showing the fluorescence trace of the replicate with median lag time for each sample were created using R 39 . Lag time plots depict the mean time value at which each replicate crossed an arbitrary fluorescence value above the noise (values were selected per experiment and applied to all samples). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the replicate lag times for each sample.

Seeds were produced by incubating 50 μM K12 as above, but without ThS present, and added at 0.25% (v/v). Peptide stock concentrations were 0.75 mM and added at a final concentration of 10-fold molar excess relative to soluble K12. Reaction mixtures were otherwise prepared and monitored as above.

The VQIVYK fibrillation assay was modified from a previously published protocol 40 . Buffers and plates were kept on ice to delay VQIVYK fibrillation while the reaction mixtures were prepared. Replicate solutions of 180 μL of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 100 μM ThS, and inhibitor peptides were added to black, clear-bottom, 96-well Nunc plates with 1/8″ PTFE beads (Orange Products, Inc.). Acetylated and amidated VQIVYK (Genscript, Inc.) was dissolved in H 2 O to 1.3 mM and filtered through a Millipore microcon 100-kDa filter device at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C to remove large aggregates (final concentration ~1mM). 20 μL of filtered VQIVYK were added to each reaction well. ThS fluorescence was monitored at room temperature every 2 minutes using a SpectraMax M5 fluorimeter with 2 seconds of mixing before each reading.

Lyophilized amyloid beta(1-42) was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in 50 mM NH 4 OH and filtered with a 0.2 μm filter. The reaction mixture contained a final concentration of 11.5 μM Aβ1-42, 10 μM Thioflavin T (ThT), 23 mM NH 4 OH in 100 mM Bicine pH 9.1 and 11.5 μM D-TLKIVW in reactions with peptide present. Reactions were split into 4 replicates and the ThT fluorescence signal was measured every minute (Ex. 444/Em. 482) at 37°C with continuous shaking at 960 rpm with a 1 mm diameter in a Varioskan fluorimeter.

5 μL of sample were applied to glow-discharged, 400-mesh carbon-coated, formvar films on copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 3 minutes. Grids were rinsed twice with distilled water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 90 seconds. Grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope at 75 kEv or a JEOL JEM1200-EX operating at 80 kEv.

The nucleation (k1) and propagation (k2) rates were determined by fitting the form of the Finke-Watzky 2-step mechanism 41 . Plateau values were determined and the remaining parameters were fit using the leasqr non-linear least-squares regression function ( http://fly.isti.cnr.it/pub/software/octave/leasqr/ ) through the octave software package ( http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ ).

Peptide-nanogold conjugates were prepared as described earlier for similarly sized peptides 42 . Briefly, 60 nmol of the peptides CGGG-(D)-TLKIVW and CGGG-(D)-LKTWIV (CS Bio) were dissolved in 110 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl), added to 6 nmol of monomaleimido nanogold (Nanoprobes, Inc.), dissolved in 200 μl H 2 O, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with constant rotation. Peptide-nanogold conjugates were separated from excess unbound peptides by membrane centrifugation (Microcon-10 system; Amicon) using a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa. Peptide-nanogold conjugates were then diluted into phosphate-buffered saline, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C for no longer than 1 month.

K19 fibers were generated by incubating 100 μM of soluble K19 with 25 μM of 6-kDa heparin overnight at 37°C in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). K19 fibers were sonicated for 15 s, using a microtip set to 35% amplitude. Residual heparin and small oligomers were removed by centrifuging the mixture through a 100-kDa Microcon concentrator for 10 minutes at 14,000 × g, washing the retentate with phosphate buffer, and repeating three times; the retentate was restored to its original volume with phosphate buffer. These short fiber segments were stored at 4°C for no longer than 1 week. For NMR studies, fiber samples were similarly prepared, but washed in H 2 O and concentrated to 2mM K19 (by monomer).

10 nM of the nanogold conjugate (or control) was incubated with 1.67 μM (by monomer) of K19 fibers in MOPS buffer (25 mM, pH 7.2) for 1 hour. 5 μL was applied to a glow-discharged 400 mesh carbon-stabilized copper grid (Ted Pella) for 3 minutes. The grids were washed twice with H 2 O and 10 μl of the Goldenhance reagent was applied for 10 seconds. The grids were washed 5 times with H 2 O and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate.

For each sample, 75 nanogold particles ≤ 15 nm in diameter were counted and classified as bound or unbound. The 15 nm cutoff was to exclude unbound, but adjacent, particles enlarged by Goldenhance that only apparently bind fibers. To establish the localization of the binding observed, individual nanogold particles bound to fibers were categorized as bound to the fiber end or side. In both of these experiments, sample identities were concealed from the microscopist to ensure unbiased counting. Grids were examined with a JEOL JEM1200-EX and images were recorded using Digital Micrograph (Gatan, Inc.).

We compared counts of nanogold-conjugated peptides and unconjugated nanogold bound to fibers or localizing to fiber ends. 21 unconjugated nanogold particles out of 75 counted bound to fibers. We modeled nanogold particles bound to fibers using a binomial distribution with parameters n = 75 (sample size) observations and p = 0.28 (probability of success). In a separate experiment, 22 unconjugated nanogold particles bound to fibers that localized to fiber ends, following a binomial distribution with n = 105 and p = 0.21.

Because the number of counts is fairly large, we assumed a normal distribution, and used a standard z-test to compare the number of bound nanogold-peptide conjugates to the expected distribution based on the number of bound unconjugated nanogold particles. We used analogous analysis to determine the significant of localization to fiber ends.

The number of nanogold-D-TLKIVW conjugates bound to fibers ( x bound = 43, n = 75) and bound nanogold-D-TLKIVW localizing to the end of fibers ( x end = 49, n = 86) was significantly different from nanogold alone, whereas the number of nanogold-D-LKTWIV conjugates bound ( x bound = 15, n = 75) or the number localized to fiber ends ( x end = 17, n = 100) does not differ significantly from nanogold alone.

Acetylated and amidated VQIVYK peptide (Genscript, Inc) was dissolved to 1 mM in 25 mM MOPS pH 7.2 and incubated at room temperature for at least 24 hours. Fibers were washed with H 2 O, concentrated using a 3-kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon ultracentrifugal filter, and resuspended in H 2 O to a final concentration (by monomer) of 4 mM. Soluble VQIVYK was prepared by dissolving VQIVYK peptide (CS Bio, Inc.) with free N- and C- termini in H 2 O.

NMR samples were prepared with 5% D 2 O and 10mM NaOAc pH 5.0. D-Peptides were added from 1 mM stocks in H 2 O to a final concentration of 100 μM. Soluble and fibrillar VQIVYK and tau were added at indicated concentrations to make a final volume of 550 μL. 500 MHz 1 H NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker DRX500 at 283 K. H 2 O resonance was suppressed through presaturation. Spectra were processed with XWINNMR 3.6.

NMR data were analyzed to estimate a binding constant for the interaction between D-TLKIVW and VQIVYK fibers. At about 1000 μM VQIVYK (concentration as monomer), 50% of D-TLKIVW is bound ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). The steric zipper model suggests that there are 2 monomers per 4.7 Å (0.47 nm) layer in a fiber 14 : Monomers per fiber = [ ( Fiber length ( nm ) ] ∗ ( 2 monomers / 0.47 nm ) , and we estimate the fiber concentration using the monomer concentration: [ VQIVYK fiber ] = [ VQIVYK momomer ] ÷ ( monomers per fiber ) .

If we assume one binding site and estimate from electron microscopy an average length of ~140 nm per fiber, then there are about 600 monomers per fiber, and the apparent Kd is about 2 μM.

We used areaimol 31 to calculate the apolar and polar area buried by the interaction D-TLKIVW with the VQIVYK steric zipper ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We calculate 201, 24, and 102 Å 2 buried for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, respectively. Using the atomic solvation parameters of Eisenberg and coworkers 43 , we estimate that the ΔG solvation is approximately 2.5 kcal/mol. Based on an apparent Kd of 2 μM, we estimate ΔG binding to be 7.4 kcal/mol. From the interaction model ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1 ), we maintain 6 hydrogen bonds between D-TLKIVW and VQIVYK, and if

The GGVLVN peptide was dissolved in 10mM Tris, pH 9 at 1.8 mg/ml and crystallized in 10% (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0, 0.2 M Zn(OAc) 2 . X-ray diffraction data was collected at APS beamline 24-IDE. Phases were determined by molecular replacement using an idealized β-strand in Phaser 44 . Crystallographic refinement was performed using Refmac 45 . Model building was performed with Coot 46 and illustrated with PyMOL 47 .

Fmoc-β-cyclohexyl-L-alanine and Fmoc-7-hydroxy-(S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid were purchased from AnaSpec, Inc and the inhibitor peptide H-[W-H-K-chAla-W-hydroxyTic]-OH (WW61) was synthesized by Celtek Biosciences LLC. 248 PAP 286 and WW61 were dissolved as 1.25X and 5X stocks in PBS, respectively, and filtered with a 0.1 μm filter. 248 PAP 286 was diluted with PBS to 0.66 mM and ThT was added to 10μM final. Samples were optionally mixed with 1.32 mM WW61 and vortexed. 5 replicates of 150 μL were immediately dispensed into a 96-well plate. In dose-response experiments, WW61 final concentrations were 0.33 mM, 0.66 mM, and 1.32 mM. Plates were continuously agitated at 960 rpm at 37°C, and ThT fluoresence readings were recorded (Ex. 440/Em. 482) in 15-minute intervals with a Varioskan Flash fluorimeter. Lag time was determined when fluorescence crossed an arbitrary value (3 RFU) above background.

The CCR5 tropic molecular HIV-1 clone NL4_3/92TH014-2 48 was generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with proviral DNA. Supernatants were collected 48 hours later and p24 concentrations determined by ELISA. TZM-bl reporter cells encoding a lacZ gene under the control of the viral LTR promoter were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and provided by Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme Inc 49 . 40 μl HIV-1 containing 0.1 ng p24 antigen was incubated with 40 μl dilutions of mixtures of 248 PAP 286 and inhibitory peptide that was either freshly prepared or had been agitated for 23 hours. Peptide concentrations and experimental conditions during agitation were similar to those described above. Thereafter, 20 μl of the mixtures were used to infect 180 μl TZM-bl cells seeded the day before (1×10 5 /well). 2 days later infection rates were determined by quantifying β-galactosidase activities in cellular lysates using the Gal-Screen assay (Applied Biosystem, T1027). Luminescence was recorded on an Orion microplate luminometer as relative light units per second (RLU/s).

50 μl of poly-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) were mixed with equal volumes of WW61. Thereafter, 35 μl of 5-fold dilutions of poly-lysine/WW61 mixtures or poly-lysine alone were incubated with the same volume of virus and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Poly-lysine/WW61 concentrations were 100, 20, 4, 0.8, 0.16, 0.032, 0.064 and 0 μg/ml during preincubation with virus stocks. Thereafter, 20 μl of each mixture were added to 180 μl TZM-bl cells. The infection rate was determined 2 days later as described above.

40 μl of each peptide was incubated with an equal volume of virus containing 1 ng of p24 antigens for 5 minutes at room temperature. Peptide concentrations were 150, 30, 6, 1.2 and 0 μg/ml during preincubation with virus stocks. Thereafter, 20 μl of mixtures were added to 180 μl TZM-bl cells (10-fold dilution) and the infection rate was determined as above.
