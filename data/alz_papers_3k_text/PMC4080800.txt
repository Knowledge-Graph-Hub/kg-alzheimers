Development, maintenance and disruption of the blood-brain barrier

# Abstract
The interface between the blood circulation and the neural tissue features unique characteristics which are embraced by the term ‘blood-brain barrier’ (BBB). The main functions of this barrier, namely maintenance of brain homeostasis, regulation of influx and efflux transport, and protection from harm, are determined by its specialized multicellular structure. Every constituent cell type makes an indispensible contribution to the BBB’s integrity. But, if one member of the BBB fails and as a result, the barrier breaks down, there can be dramatic consequences, and neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can occur. In this Review we highlight recently gained mechanistic insights into the development and maintenance of the BBB. We then discuss how BBB disruption can cause or contribute to neurological disease. Finally, we examine how this knowledge can be used to explore new possibilities for BBB repair.

## Introduction
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a multicellular vascular structure that separates the central nervous system (CNS) from the peripheral blood circulation. Beyond barrier function, influx and efflux is actively regulated at the blood-brain interface. By tightly controlling the passage of molecules and ions, instantaneously delivering nutrients and oxygen according to current neuronal needs, and by protecting the brain from toxins and pathogens, the BBB maintains an environment that allows neurons to function properly.

The core anatomical element of the BBB is the cerebral blood vessel formed by endothelial cells (ECs). ECs of the BBB are unique compared with ECs in different tissues as they have continuous intercellular tight junctions (TJs), lack fenestrations and undergo extremely low rates of transcytosis, which greatly limits both the paracellular and transcellular movement of molecules through the EC layer 1 . This means that passage of molecules through the BBB is regulated by a series of specific transporters, which allow delivery of nutrients to the brain and extrusion of potential toxins. In addition, ECs have low expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, abrogating immune cell infiltration into the healthy CNS, although there is immune surveillance to a limited extent 2 .

The BBB exists at all levels of the vascular tree within the CNS, including the penetrating arteries and arterioles, the dense capillary bed, the post-capillary venules and draining venules and veins 3 . Although each vascular segment needs to maintain tight barrier properties to insulate the neural tissue from the blood, there are specializations within the vascular bed that are crucial for BBB function. For instance, nutrient transport is highly specialized to the capillaries which come in close proximity of all the neurons, whereas regulation of leukocyte trafficking and immune modulation resides at the post-capillary venule where there is a perivascular space 4 , 5 .

The development and maintenance of the BBB are governed by cellular and non-cellular elements that interact with the ECs. Astrocytes, pericytes, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components provide both structural and functional support to the BBB. The term ‘neurovascular unit’ (NVU) additionally refers to neurons, microglial cells and, optionally, peripheral immune cells that also contribute to this cellular interplay 1 , 6 ( Fig. 1 ). The abluminal surface of brain capillaries is ensheathed by a basement membrane that separates ECs from pericytes, and pericytes from astrocytes 7 . At the level of the post-capillary venule, the two basement membranes are distinct (endothelial and parenchymal) and define the inner and outer border of the perivascular space 7 where bone marrow-derived perivascular cells have key immunoregulatory functions 8 .

Recently, extensive efforts have been made to better understand the BBB’s uniqueness in structural and functional terms. Large-scale genomic and proteomic approaches have yielded data that can help explain the distinct properties of this barrier and elucidated mechanisms that participate during BBB development and maintenance and in disease 9 , 10 . Comprehensive gene and protein expression analyses also provide the opportunity to evaluate current in vitro models and their physiological relevance. For example, brain microvascular ECs, irrespective of their origin, lose some of their BBB properties in vitro 11 , 12 . Therefore, the improvement of existing BBB models is an important challenge, as we discuss.

In this Review, we highlight how recent insights into the BBB have yielded a new understanding of how the BBB is developed and maintained, what goes awry in disease, and the potential for BBB repair.

## Development of the BBB
The development of the BBB is a multistep process ( Fig. 2 ), which begins with angiogenesis when pre-existing vessels sprout into the embryonic neuroectoderm and give rise to new vessels. These early sprouts exhibit many BBB properties, including the expression of TJs and nutrient transporters. They also contain large numbers of transcytotic vesicles and show high expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Barrier properties of the BBB mature as nascent vessels come into close contact with pericytes and astroglia. This process includes elaboration of TJs, decreased transcytosis, downregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules and increased efflux transporter expression. Sealing of interendothelial TJs is completed during maturation and needs to be maintained throughout life.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a fundamental role in embryonic angiogenesis. In mice deficient for Vegf receptor 2 (Vegfr-2; also known as fetal liver kinase 1, Flk-1; encoded by kinase insert domain receptor, Kdr ) blood vessel formation fails throughout the body and Kdr -/- embryos die around E9 13 . Ligand deficiency, both in homozygous Vegf -/- and heterozygous Vegf +/- mice, also leads to early embryonic lethality, but blood vessel formation is severely compromised rather than completely abolished 14 . In the embryonic brain, cells in the subventricular neuroectoderm produce Vegf, which directs sprouting vessels along a Vegf concentration gradient 15 . Reduced or absent neural Vegf results in abnormal vessel density and other malformations, particularly in the cortex and the retina 16 . Downstream elements of VEGFR-2 signaling include the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, which leads to EC proliferation, the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway supporting EC survival, and the p38/MAPK-HSP27 pathway, which promotes EC migration 17 .

The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is activated in CNS ECs during embryogenesis but not ECs in non-neural tissues and therefore drives angiogenesis specifically in the CNS 18 . During mouse embryogenesis, neural progenitors express Wnt7a and Wnt7b in the developing forebrain and the ventral regions of the neural tube, as well as Wnt1, Wnt3, and Wnt3b in the dorsal spinal cord and the hindbrain 18 . In the canonical pathway, Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors (Fzd) on the vascular endothelium, leading to inhibition of beta-catenin degradation in the proteasome. Beta-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and induces transcription of target genes by interactions with lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/T cell-specific transcription factor (LEF/TCF) DNA-binding proteins 19 . Several genes regulated by beta-catenin, including Lef1, Apcdd1, Axin2, Stra6 , and Slc2a1 are enriched in CNS ECs compared to ECs in non-neural tissues 9 , 18 . Knockout mice for Wnt7b but not Wnt7a die between E11.5 and E12.5 due to severe brain hemorrhage and abnormal vessel morphology in ventral regions 18 , 20 . Lack of the downstream signaling element beta-catenin in ECs results in normal vascularization of all organs but vessel formation completely fails in the CNS 18 .

The canonical Wnt pathway also has a central role in BBB formation. Wnt induces the expression of BBB genes, including nutrient transporters such as Slc2a1 (encoding Glut-1) 20 . Therefore, the same signal that drives EC migration into the CNS also induces BBB functions, suggesting a CNS-specific angiogenic program that imparts barrier-specific properties to the vasculature. A recent study revealed that increased abundance of beta-catenin in the developing brain induces expression of the death receptors Dr6 (also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 21, Tnfrsf21) and Troy (also known as Tnfrsf19), both of which interact with downstream elements of the VEGF pathway 21 . These authors then showed that enhanced expression of Dr6 and Troy downstream of beta-catenin signaling drives brain angiogenesis, as observed by EC sprouting and BBB formation 21 . Endothelial beta-catenin also has a key role in embryonic and postnatal BBB maturation by regulating the formation of TJs, and the increased expression of claudin-3 has been proposed to be involved in this process 22 .

GPR124, an orphan member of the G protein-coupled receptor family (also known as tumor endothelial marker 5, TEM5), has recently been identified as an essential endothelial receptor for brain-specific angiogenesis. Gpr124 knockout mice are embryonic lethal and have defects in the vasculature of the developing CNS, with hemorrhages mainly in the forebrain and ventral spinal cord 23 - 25 . The phenotype is characterized by impaired EC survival, growth and migration, which result in an inability of vascular sprouts to invade the embryonic neuroectoderm. Gpr124 seems to act independently from Vegf in vessel sprouting, as expression of Vegfr was unaffected in the absence of Gpr124 23 , 24 . Gpr124 knockout mice and Wnt signaling mutants share strikingly similar vascular defects, including a lack of Glut-1 expression 18 , 20 , suggesting interactions between these different pathways during brain vessel development.

Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) has been identified as important for BBB formation. Shh knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality between E11 and E13.5 and their phenotype is associated with abnormalities in BBB formation 26 . Despite having normal numbers of blood vessels, Shh knockout mouse embryos showed decreased expression of TJ proteins such as occludin and claudin-5. Moreover, when Smoothened (Smo), a downstream signaling protein of the Shh signaling pathway, was selectively deleted from ECs, this resulted in lower TJ protein expression which was associated with vessel leakage of plasma proteins 26 . These data suggest that unlike Wnt, Shh is not required for angiogenesis in the CNS, but for the maturation of the BBB properties once vessels are formed. In vitro experiments confirmed that SHH produced by astrocytes upregulates TJ protein expression in human BBB ECs and can decrease solute permeability, indicating that SHH could also have a role in maintaining BBB functions 26 . BBB ECs express the SHH receptor patched 1 (PTC1), which is inhibited on ligand binding. The co-receptor SMO becomes activated, ultimately leading to the translocation of GLI transcription factors into the nucleus 27 . In vitro , Shh can induce Vegf and angiopoietin (Ang) expression, which are both strong angiogenic factors 28 . Although this study focused on fibroblasts, it may be worthwhile investigating possible interactions between VEGF and HH signaling in BBB ECs and their relationship to BBB development.

## Key supporters of the BBB endothelium
Pericytes ensheath the abluminal surfaces of cerebral vessel walls including those of capillaries, pre-capillary arterioles and post-capillary venules 29 . Among capillary beds of different organs the neural tissue shows the highest pericyte coverage 30 , suggesting that pericytes have an important role in the BBB. They perform various neurovascular tasks, including contributing to vessel stability, regulating capillary diameter and blood flow, and controlling BBB integrity and function 31 .

Elucidating the role of pericytes within the NVU has been challenging as there is currently no distinct pericyte-specific marker 32 , 33 . Pericytes are a rather heterogeneous and dynamic cell population whose expression of surface markers varies according to cell differentiation and the tissue where they reside 33 . Recent work suggests platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β) may be a useful marker, particularly for brain pericytes 34 - 36 . Mice deficient for Pdgfr-β or its ligand Pdgf-b completely lack brain pericytes, resulting in embryonic lethality and CNS microhemorrhages 37 . In mouse embryos lacking Pdgfr-β or Pdgf-b, ECs have an abnormal distribution of junctional proteins and show increased vascular permeability 38 . Pericytes are involved in vascular differentiation as early as E12 in the rat. As angiogenic ECs form nascent vessels, they may attract developing pericytes by releasing Pdgf-b that signals to Pdgfr-β-expressing pericytes leading to pericyte proliferation and their co-migration with sprouting vessels 37 , 39 . Pericyte-EC crosstalk enhances EC TJ formation, decreases transcytosis and decreases leukocyte adhesion molecule expression in the developing BBB 36 .

When pericytes have proliferated and have been directed to sprouting vessels, adhesion between ECs and pericytes is mediated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Both cell types secrete TGF-β and express its receptor TGF-βR2 31 . TGF-β signaling in pericytes initiates production of ECM molecules whereas TGF-β signaling in ECs promotes pericyte adhesion by upregulating Cadherin-2 (also known as N-cadherin) 31 . Mice deficient for Smad4, a key protein in TGF-β signaling, show pericyte detachment associated with increased microvessel diameters, increased BBB permeability, and hemorrhage 40 . Two further signaling pathways regulate Cadherin-2: Notch ligand on pericytes signals to Notch1 on the EC surface, leading to enhanced EC expression of Cadherin-2; and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) activates the endothelial receptor S1P1 to activate downstream RhoA and Rac1, mediating Cadherin-2 translocation to the EC surface 31 .

Mice with hypomorphic alleles of Pdgfr-β or Pdgf-b have been used to demonstrate that pericytes are required for maintenance of BBB integrity. In these mice, reducing Pdgfr-β signaling by deleting tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Pdgfr-β or by deleting the ECM retention motif of Pdgf-b resulted in mice that were viable but had fewer pericytes than their wild-type littermates 41 , 42 . Young adult mice expressing the retention motif-deficient Pdgf-b form show a strong negative correlation between the extent of vessel coverage by pericytes and vascular permeability 34 . Interestingly, vessel leakage was not caused by compromised expression of TJ proteins but, instead, defective regulation of endothelial transcytosis was proposed to explain the observed loss of BBB integrity. Moreover, this study also provided evidence that pericytes may guide astrocytic foot processes to the endothelial tube, which subsequently initiates proper end-foot polarization. Hence, pericytes seem to fulfill a remarkably central role at the NVU ( Fig. 3 ).

Astrocytes provide nutrition for neurons, regulate extracellular potassium balance, carry out neurotransmitter clearance and recycling, control immune reactions, and regulate the BBB 43 . Perivascular astrocyte end-feet, which encircle the abluminal side of cerebral vessels, are highly specialized and polarized structures that have orthogonal arrays of intramembranous particles (OAPs) consisting of the most abundant water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel Kir4.1 44 . About 30 years ago it was found that vascularization of developing neural tissue, but not non-neural tissue, induces barrier characteristics in ECs 45 . This observation prompted exploration of how cells of the astrocyte lineage influence the BBB phenotype of the cerebral endothelium. As the immature neural environment contains astrocyte precursors, these cells were proposed to release soluble factors that determine the fate of cerebral vascular ECs, and this hypothesis has now been supported by in vitro co-culture experiments. Compared with ECs cultured alone, ECs co-cultured with astrocytes or astrocyte-conditioned media exhibit improved barrier functions. This is implemented by elevated expression of transporters, enhanced activities of metabolic enzymes, and increased TJ formation by the co-cultured ECs 46 . Proposed candidates for astrocyte-derived soluble factors that induce these aspects of the BBB phenotype include interleukin-6 (IL-6) 47 , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) 48 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) 49 . However, it is unclear if such factors simply improve barrier function in cultured ECs, which are known to lose some of their properties outside their natural environment 11 , 12 . A more refined study using both in vitro and in vivo approaches revealed that A-kinase anchor protein 12 (AKAP-12; also known as Src-suppressed C-kinase substrate, SSeCKS) can be activated in astrocytes, leading to upregulation and secretion of Ang-1 50 . Tie-2 receptors on cerebral ECs bind Ang-1, increasing TJ protein expression and enhancing barrier tightness 50 .

More recent studies suggest that astrocytes may be involved in maintenance rather than induction of cerebrovascular integrity, because astrocytes initially appear at the NVU postnatally 36 . Astrocytes secrete SHH which modulates BBB TJs 26 . Another mechanism is implemented by the renin-angiotensin hormone system. Astrocytes express angiotensinogen 51 which is converted by renin to the biologically inactive angiotensin I (ANG I). Further processing of ANG I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) results in the effector molecule ANG II, whose type 1 ANG receptor (AT1) is present on CNS endothelium 52 . This crosstalk between astrocytes and ECs controls posttranslational modification of occludin and its subcellular accumulation in lipid rafts 52 . Accordingly, adult angiotensinogen-deficient mice exhibit a leaky BBB 52 .

Astrocytes also produce the cholesterol and phospholipid transporter molecule apolipoprotein E (APOE), which mediates regulatory processes related to brain homeostasis 43 . Adult Apoe knockout mice show increased permeability selectively of cerebral vessels and leakage of serum proteins into the CNS tissue 53 . Whereas APOE3, the most abundant human APOE isoform, and APOE2 mediate physiological BBB tightness, APOE4 promotes BBB disruption, as observed in mutant mice in which mouse Apoe was replaced by human APOE isoforms 54 , 55 . These differences may arise from the increased efficiency of APOE3 compared with APOE4 at activating protein kinase C eta (PKCη) through lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) present in cerebral microvessels 56 . In vitro , activated PKCη induced the phosphorylation of occludin, suggesting a mechanism for improved barrier integrity in an APOE3 BBB model compared with APOE4 54 . Another, non-mutually exclusive explanation for the differential effects of APOE isoforms on the BBB derives from findings that APOE4 activated an inflammatory and TJ disruptive pathway in pericytes. In contrast, APOE2 and APOE3 suppressed this pathway, thereby rescuing BBB from breakdown 55 .

Cellular interplay within the NVU is essential for proper BBB function, and lack or dysfunction of one cell type impairs BBB development or promotes BBB breakdown. This concept of interplay also applies to the ECM, which consists of the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane. ECs, astrocytes and pericytes contribute to basement membrane formation by secreting ECM molecules. The basement membrane is mostly made up of structural proteins such as collagen type IV, laminin and fibronectin, and also contains cell adhesion molecules and immobilized signaling proteins 57 . At the level of the post-capillary venule, which has a perivascular space, there are two distinct basement membranes: endothelial and parenchymal. Endothelial and parenchymal basement membranes have distinct compositions of ECM molecules, which determine their different functions 7 . Microvessels without a perivascular space exhibit a composite basement membrane 7 . Basement membranes keep members of the NVU in place and regulate their intercellular crosstalk.

Interactions between the basement membranes and their associated cells are enabled by two types of matrix transmembrane receptors: dystroglycan and integrins; and their extracellular ECM ligands: laminin, fibronectin, collagen type IV, nidogen, osteonectin, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), agrin and perlecan 58 . Ligand binding leads to the activation of various growth factors and signaling cascades that control cell growth, differentiation, migration and survival during BBB development and maintenance. During brain vascularization, angiogenic ECs express α4β1 and α5β1 integrins, and binding of the ECM ligand fibronectin induces cell proliferation through MAPK signaling 59 , 60 . In the adult mouse, EC differentiation and vessel stabilization is promoted via laminin binding to α1β1 and α6β1 integrins 60 . The β1 integrin interaction with laminin directly affects cerebrovascular integrity because blocking this receptor in vitro increased vascular permeability due to decreased expression of the TJ protein claudin-5 61 . Deficiency for αv integrin or its binding partner β8 is lethal due to impaired vascularization during embryogenesis or severe cerebral hemorrhage early after birth 62 , 63 . αvβ8 integrin expressed by astrocytes binds latent TGF-β, promoting the proteolytic cleavage and release of active TGF-β, upon which TGF-β signaling in ECs is initiated 64 . Downstream target genes of TGF-β include those encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombospondin-1, two anti-angiogenic factors that stabilize cerebral vessels 64 . Accordingly, ECM ligand deficiencies also affect brain vascularization, and various vascular phenotypes have been observed in mice mutant for fibulin-1, nidogen or collagen type IV mouse 65 - 67 .

The ECM is also important in trapping and accumulating secreted molecules, enabling the stringent regulation of signaling pathways within the NVU. As one example, Wnt proteins undergo posttranslational modifications that direct their immobilization on the cell surface or on the ECM 68 , 69 . Inactive Wnt proteins are negatively regulated by Wnt inhibitors, including Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF), secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) and Dickkopf-related protein (Dkk) 70 . TGF-β signaling decreases the amounts of these inhibitors, thus releasing Wnt proteins 71 and allowing them to initiate intracellular beta-catenin signaling and transcription of target genes 19 . Another example of molecule trapping by the BBB ECM is the GAG-mediated immobilization of chemokines 72 . Chemokines oligomerize on GAGs, leading to the formation of patches with high local concentrations of chemokines, which activate immune cells and recruit them to sites of inflammation, including trafficking of immune cells across the BBB 73 .

## Links between the BBB and disease
An intact BBB is essential for building and maintaining a microenvironment that allows neuronal circuits to function properly. Its key properties include controlled leukocyte trafficking across the BBB, either for immune surveillance and effector responses to brain infections 2 , or after brain tissue damage when debris must be cleared by macrophages 74 . BBB breakdown, however, leads to increased extravasation of immune cells and poorly regulated flux of molecules and ions across the BBB when TJs are disrupted and/or transport processes are impaired 3 . The mechanisms by which BBB breakdown occurs and the consequences of a compromised barrier are manifold ( Fig. 4 ).

BBB breakdown mediated by oxidative stress is a common phenomenon in neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke 75 - 77 , but whether BBB disruption is a cause or consequence of oxidative stress can be difficult to ascertain.

Ischemic stroke occurs when cerebral blood flow is locally interrupted due to a clot within a vessel 78 . Owing to a lack of oxygen and sufficient nutrient supply, the affected surrounding neural tissue becomes damaged and neurons eventually die. The early reestablishment of blood circulation is essential to limit cerebral injury. However, during reperfusion, the return of oxygenated blood to the ischemic area challenges the BBB with oxidative stress. In experimental studies, BBB opening is biphasic; the initial breakdown is most likely caused by oxidative stress and is followed by a partial BBB recovery, before the second increase in BBB permeability leads to neutrophil infiltration through TJ redistribution 79 , 80 . Whether this order of events is also relevant in stroke patients still needs to be confirmed.

Oxidative stress indicates an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanied by a compromised intrinsic antioxidant defense. ROS contribute to BBB disruption by several mechanisms: oxidative damage to cellular molecules (proteins, lipids and DNA); activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); cytoskeletal reorganization; modulation of TJ proteins; and upregulation of inflammatory mediators 81 .

MMPs have been implicated in cerebral ischemia in that plasma MMP-9 concentrations strongly correlate with stroke severity in patients 82 . In a rat stroke model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), increasing nitric oxide (NO) concentrations during reperfusion activated Mmp-2 and Mmp-9 by downregulating caveolin-1, which is also a negative regulator of NO synthases (NOS) 83 . The same study showed that MMPs disrupt TJ proteins, rendering the BBB leaky and allowing neurotoxic agents to enter the ischemic tissue. Blocking NOS reversed these downstream effects 83 .

Dysregulation of TJ proteins has also been described in stroke pathogenesis. Within two days after inducing cerebral ischemia in rats by MCAO, the expression of claudin-5, occludin and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) decreased, and was associated with increased BBB permeability 84 . Decreased expression of TJ proteins also seems to coincide with elevated Pkcδ activity 84 , and Pkcδ inhibitors reduced infarct size and neuronal cell death in ischemic rats following MCAO 85 . Moreover, mice that lack Pkcδ show a significantly lower degree of reperfusion injury following MCAO and fewer neutrophils crossed the BBB and infiltrated the surrounding parenchyma compared to wild-type controls 86 . Neutrophils release ROS and stimulate other cells to produce cytokines, attracting more leukocytes from the periphery 86 . The recruitment of inflammatory cells is aggravated by ROS-induced NF-κB-mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on ECs 87 , propagating a post-ischemic inflammation cascade that further promotes BBB disruption. The role of neutrophils in this cascade, however, has recently been challenged. In a study that incorporated both a transient MCAO mouse model and human stroke specimens, neutrophils were mainly detected at the luminal surface and in the perivascular space of cerebral vessels rather than in the infarcted brain tissue early after the insult 88 . Similar to epilepsy, as discussed later, peripheral neutrophils could trigger the neuroinflammatory response by acting on the BBB and modulating its functions without needing to infiltrate the parenchyma.

The relevance in patients for many mechanisms of stroke identified in animal models still needs to be demonstrated. However, there is evidence that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are major contributors to vascular damage in stroke patients, and various anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies are currently under investigation 89 . Although neuroinflammation lies downstream from the initial ischemic insult, oxidative stress may be the primary cause of BBB damage during reperfusion, which then mediates further complications inside the CNS.

BBB dysfunction can result in an imbalance of ions, transmitters, and metabolic products in the interstitial fluid, causing abnormal neuronal activity. This scenario is fulfilled when seizures occur. Epilepsy can manifest as a discrete disease with repeated seizures over time, but seizures also occur in other neurological disorders that are characterized by a compromised BBB, including stroke, CNS infections and neurodegenerative diseases 90 .

Does BBB breakdown lead to seizures or do seizures lead to BBB breakdown? Over 30 years ago, BBB disruption per se was proposed to cause seizures, as osmotic opening of the BBB resulted in epileptic seizures in rats 91 . This finding was supported by a more recent clinical study where the BBB was transiently opened in patients to treat brain tumors 92 . Such osmotic BBB disruption is implemented by intravascular infusion of a hypertonic saccharide solution which leads to short-term shrinkage of ECs. Consequently, interendothelial junctions are widened, allowing paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB 93 . Elevated cerebrovascular permeability is associated with several downstream effects, all of which directly affect neuronal activity. A sudden increase in extracellular K + concentrations leads to enhanced neuronal excitability 94 . Increased excitability can also be caused by sudden increases in the concentration of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter 95 . Plasma albumin enters astrocytes in a TGF-βR-mediated process. This leads to the phosphorylation of Smad2, which downregulates Kir4.1, a potassium channel that ensures clearance of excess extracellular K + 96 , 97 . In addition, the expression of glutamate transporters by astrocytes is decreased and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is initiated 98 .

This inflammatory response subsequently promotes BBB damage ‘from the inside’. Astrocytic and microglial IL-1β and/or Vegf have been suggested to promote enhanced BBB permeability, for example, through the downregulation of ZO-1 in the microvascular endothelium 99 - 101 . From outside the BBB, leukocytes may have a role, notably without entering the brain parenchyma. In a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy it has been demonstrated that the BBB endothelium displays an activated phenotype after a seizure, and that increased Icam-1, Vcam-1, E-selectin (also known as leukocyte-endothelial adhesion molecule 2, Lecam2) and P-selectin (also known as Lecam3) expression promote leukocyte rolling and arrest at the luminal surface of the cerebral vessel 102 . Remarkably, when leukocyte-endothelial interactions were inhibited, the number of recurrent seizures and the extent of BBB damage were reduced 102 . These findings suggest that it may be possible to develop selective therapeutics that inhibit leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the periphery, thereby preventing disease initiation or progression within the brain without the need to deliver drugs across the BBB.

Together, the current findings indicate that although increased cerebrovascular permeability is key to the initiation of seizures, once the brain becomes epileptic and a neuroinflammatory response is initiated, the BBB is also crucial for determining the long-term outcome and severity of the disease.

BBB breakdown is a common hallmark of all neurodegenerative disorders 103 , but in many of these diseases it remains elusive whether BBB breakdown is one of the initial events that leads to neuronal cell death, or whether it is a downstream consequence.

ALS exists in two forms, sporadic and familial, and both have similar outcomes, suggesting a common pathogenesis. In particular, motor neurons in the spinal cord, motor cortex and brainstem are affected. The cause of ALS is still not known, but genetic susceptibility and environmental factors have been proposed to have a role 104 . Mutations in the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were shown to be linked to ALS 105 , prompting the development of various transgenic mice expressing mutant human SOD1 that model the human disease to various extents 106 .

Mice expressing mutant SOD1 have leaky barriers at their blood-brain and blood-spinal cord interfaces at disease onset, and increased neurovascular permeability has also been detected in patients with ALS 107 . Ultrastructural changes at the BBB of rodents have been observed, with swollen astrocytic end-feet and disrupted basement membranes, which are associated with loss of ECs and astrocytes, leading to edema and microhemorrhages 108 , 109 . At the molecular level, the expression of collagen IV and agrin as well as of TJ proteins including occludin and ZO-1 is reduced in ALS mouse models 109 - 111 . Similar observations were made in ALS autopsy samples, in which expression of occludin and collagen IV was decreased and MMP-9 expression was increased 111 . Interestingly, the molecular changes seem to occur prior to disease manifestation in ALS mice at a stage when neither motor neuron degeneration nor inflammation is detectable 110 . However, mutant SOD1 is overexpressed in ECs of ALS mouse models, thus it is unclear whether these observations are also relevant to humans. ALS mice show focal leakage of the cerebral microvasculature, which leads to extravasation of neurotoxic plasma proteins into areas of the brain that contain motor neurons 110 . In addition, hemoglobin-derived iron and hypoxia induce formation of ROS, microglia and astrocytes become activated, and an inflammatory response is initiated, aggravating motor neuron degeneration (the ‘Zlokovic-Cleveland model’ 107 ).

Thus, there is a growing body of evidence that subtle neurovascular changes are crucial early at the onset of ALS, and that BBB breakdown contributes to disease progression. It is unclear whether BBB opening is an initial event in ALS pathogenesis, and the mechanisms by which BBB opening is induced in this condition are still unresolved and warrant further investigation.

In the scenarios discussed above, inflammation seems to be an important aspect of the disease, but occurs as a secondary event after disease onset and usually propagates progression. However, inflammatory mediators can also disrupt the BBB and thus initiate neurological disease. A representative example is neuromyelitis optica (NMO), an inflammatory disease of the CNS that predominantly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord 112 . NMO had long been considered a subtype of MS due to overlaps in clinical manifestations and the relapsing nature of both diseases 113 , but the discovery of a serum autoantibody marker for NMO allowed the recognition of this disease as a separate entity 114 . In NMO, immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies were found to bind to the abluminal side of brain microvessels 114 , and the target autoantigen was later identified as AQP4 115 , the major water channel in the brain that accumulates in OAPs at astrocytic foot processes.

NMO lesions are characterized by Ig and activated complement deposits, neutrophil and eosinophil infiltrates, and loss of astrocytic AQP4, which together suggest that a humoral immune response drives pathogenesis 116 - 118 . This concept is further supported by the observation that anti-AQP4 antibody titers correlate with disease severity and that plasma exchange and B cell depletion are beneficial in a substantial fraction of NMO patients 119 - 121 .

Several effector functions have been demonstrated for AQP4-IgG. AQP4-IgG mediates AQP4 internalization and its translocation into endosomal vesicles where the protein is degraded 122 . Aqp4 knockout mice show defects in BBB integrity with swollen astrocytic end-feet that impair the homeostasis of water in the brain 123 . BBB breakdown is also a key feature in patients with NMO, and the expression of markers of BBB disruption correlate with clinical severity 124 , 125 . It has been suggested that AQP4-IgG can mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity, but whether this mechanism is involved in the process of BBB disruption is still debated 122 , 126 , 127 . The classical complement pathway could also be relevant to the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, both of which are present in active NMO lesions 116 . In a BBB model consisting of co-cultured astrocytes and ECs, incubation with AQP4-IgG-positive sera from NMO patients along with complement enhanced granulocyte migration across the barrier, whereas heat inactivation of complement prevented transmigration 128 . Infiltrated granulocytes might be involved in brain tissue damage by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes 129 . The same in vitro study also provided evidence that astrocyte injury in NMO is mediated by AQP4-IgG-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, acting in concert with natural killer cells.

It is still unresolved how the AQP4 autoantibody circulating in the periphery reaches its target antigen, which is localized behind the BBB at perivascular foot processes. Experimental transfer of purified AQP4-IgG into mice results in a neuropathological phenotype reminiscent of that observed in the CNS lesions of NMO patients, but only in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), when there is a pre-existing inflammatory environment in the brain and a compromised BBB 130 , 131 . The same effect can be achieved by direct injection of AQP4-IgG and human complement into the non-inflamed brain of wild-type mice but not in Aqp4 knockout mice 128 . These findings indicate that BBB disruption is prerequisite for the antibody to find its target, as only about 0.1% of IgG molecules normally cross the intact BBB. Which factors in NMO sera can induce BBB disruption? Endothelium-specific antibodies, VEGF and MMP-9 have been found to be elevated in NMO 124 , 132 , and MMP-9 release from infiltrating neutrophils might degrade the BBB basement membrane 124 . Moreover, circulating antibodies from NMO patients directed against EC epitopes could activate the cerebral endothelium and could induce TNF-α and VEGF secretion as well as upregulation of ICAM-1 by ECs 132 .

In conclusion, NMO is an autoimmune disease in which the initial inflammatory response takes place at the luminal face of the microvascular BBB. Subsequent modulation of the BBB, including activation of ECs, promotes transmigration of immune cells. However, substantial entry of AQP4-IgG can only take place after a certain degree of BBB disruption. AQP4-IgG impair astrocyte function and promote astrocyte cell death, exacerbating BBB breakdown and recruitment of more inflammatory cells into the CNS, propagating tissue injury.

## Strategies to repair the BBB
Is BBB disruption reversible, and if yes, can we take advantage of underlying mechanisms for therapeutic purposes? Undoubtedly, repair of BBB damage is an intrinsic skill of the NVU, as most disorders associated with BBB breakdown are neither progressive nor fatal.

Currently, the only applicable and most widely used therapeutic approach has been to improve BBB integrity by glucocorticosteroid (GC) treatment. GCs are generally applied to control unwanted inflammatory responses, and most information about their mechanisms of action arose in the context of autoimmune disorders 133 . GCs were shown to restore BBB integrity in patients with MS 134 . In vitro , sera from MS patients can increase the permeability of mouse BBB ECs by downregulating occludin and claudin-5 and upregulating Mmp-9, and these effects can partially be reversed by GCs 135 . In vitro studies also revealed that the GC dexamethasone upregulates metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (also known as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, Timp-1) 136 , and that hydrocortisone enhanced expression of endothelial occludin and claudin-5 through activation of GC receptors 137 . Annexin A1, an anti-inflammatory protein, is upregulated by GCs 138 , and its expression is decreased on the BBB endothelium in MS tissue sections 139 . Annexin A1 mediates cytoskeletal rearrangements and can therefore also influence TJ formation 139 . Accordingly, mice deficient for annexin A1 have a leaky BBB due to impaired interendothelial junctions 139 . In mice with EAE, astrocytes at lesion centers were activated and secreted Vegf-a 140 . Vegf-a-mediated signaling increased BBB permeability due to the upregulation of endothelial NOS, which reduced TJ protein expression 140 . In MS patients, respectively, GCs may reverse this process by downregulating VEGF production. Although GCs seem to be able to resolve a disrupted BBB by a variety of mechanisms, chronic GC therapy has severe adverse effects, emphasizing the need for more selective therapeutics that can accelerate recovery from BBB breakdown.

Another promising therapeutic approach being tested in clinical trials is based on a multipotent non-hematopoetic cell population: mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs have been proposed to be a pericyte lineage residing in the perivascular space 141 , and have immunomodulatory, protective and regenerative skills on tissue injury and are therefore of interest for treating autoimmune and/or neurodegenerative disorders 142 . A role for MSCs in regeneration of the brain microvasculature has been proposed for stroke. Intravenous injection of MSCs into rats subjected to MCAO led to an increase in Vegf and Ang-1 secretion. This promoted angiogenesis, vessel stabilization and restoration of the damaged BBB, which may involve a local increase in endothelial occludin expression within the damaged area 143 . Although clinical trials using MSCs are currently ongoing for various neurological disorders, more knowledge about these cells is required to evaluate their applicability and safety in a broader set of diseases that are characterized by BBB breakdown.

Other approaches that potentially qualify for therapeutic BBB repair are currently under investigation, but in most cases their clinical implementation is still far from reality. One promising avenue is TJ proteins, as these molecules are key players in BBB integrity. Inducing the expression of TJ proteins after BBB breakdown could accelerate BBB reestablishment and reduce disease severity, as shown in mice with EAE 140 , 144 . In ApoE transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer’s disease, cyclosporine A promoted BBB integrity by inhibiting an inflammatory pathway in pericytes that caused TJ degradation and extravasation of neurotoxic serum proteins 55 . Further research in this field may reveal more treatment options for neurological complications associated with BBB breakdown.

## Perspectives
In the last decade, a number of studies have provided new mechanistic insights into the development, maturation and maintenance of the BBB. Today, researchers recognize that the BBB is not just an anatomical barrier at the blood-brain interface that controls exchange of molecules in and out of the CNS. Instead, since the introduction of the term ‘neurovascular unit’ 1 , 6 , the BBB is appreciated as an integral part of a complex cellular interplay whose members permanently interact and regulate each other’s functions. Furthermore, the NVU assures crosstalk between the periphery and the brain, and thus the BBB operates as a bidirectional mediator in this process.

We have also gained a deeper understanding of how the BBB is disrupted in disease and moreover, how a broken BBB can be repaired. Notably, TJs have a key role, and accelerating TJ reestablishment may be a promising approach for the treatment of neurological disorders that are characterized by a compromised BBB. It is becoming increasingly evident that the signaling pathways that are involved in TJ formation and modulation participate in a complex network within the NVU.

There is a wide variety of model systems to further explore BBB function and dysfunction. The number of suitable mouse and rat models is continuously increasing 145 , but alternative model organisms such as grasshopper, fruit fly, and zebrafish also hold promise for studying this complex barrier in vivo while being less labor- and cost-intensive than vertebrate models 146 . In silico approaches can also assist in designing drugs that can efficiently penetrate the BBB – a prerequisite for the successful treatment of CNS diseases 147 , and those studies can help to better understand the functionality of this highly selective barrier. In vitro models represent another sophisticated method for BBB research. There are ongoing efforts to develop better in vitro models that more accurately mimic the in vivo barrier. A recent innovative culture system allows human pluripotent stem cells to co-differentiate into cerebrovascular ECs and neural progenitors that signal to ECs and thereby promote the establishment of relevant BBB properties 148 . Furthermore, co-culture systems are becoming increasingly popular as they account for the importance of pericytes and astrocytes in the regulation of the BBB 149 , 150 . Even more complex triple culture systems have been explored, and microglia as well as neurons have been included in such systems 151 - 154 . Dynamic BBB models that incorporate shear forces have also been designed and this feature further improves the validity of in vitro models 155 , 156 . The new generation of BBB models will hopefully enable studies of the BBB under healthy and pathological conditions while considering the cellular interplay within the NVU. In addition, such systems may allow the exploration of new possibilities for restoring the BBB in neurological disease.
