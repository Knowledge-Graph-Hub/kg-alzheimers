Effect of Citalopram on Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease – The
CitAD Randomized Controlled Trial

# Abstract
Agitation is common, persistent, and associated with adverse
consequences for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological
treatment options, including antipsychotics are not satisfactory. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for
agitation in patients with AD. Key secondary objectives examined effects of
citalopram on function, caregiver distress, safety, cognitive safety, and
tolerability. The Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease Study (CitAD) was
a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group
trial that enrolled 186 patients with probable AD and clinically significant
agitation from eight academic centers in the US and Canada from August 2009
to January 2013. Participants (n=186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial
intervention plus either citalopram (n=94) or placebo (n=92) for 9 weeks.
Dose began at 10 mg/d with planned titration to 30 mg/d over 3 weeks based
on response and tolerability. Primary outcome measures were the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale,
agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative
Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC) Other outcomes were
the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory
(NPI), activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive
safety (MMSE), and adverse events. Participants on citalopram showed significant improvement compared to
placebo on both primary outcome measures. NBRS-A estimated treatment
difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was −0.93 [95% CI:
−1.80 to −0.06], p = 0.036. mADCS-CGIC results showed 40% of
citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline
compared to 26% on placebo, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio of
being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 [95% CI 1.23 to
3.69], p = 0.007. Participants on citalopram showed significant improvement
on the CMAI, total NPI and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI
agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of
cognition (−1.05 points [95% CI: −1.97 to −0.13], p =
0.026) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms [95% CI: 6.1, 30.1], p = 0.004)
were seen in the citalopram group. Among patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and agitation
receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared
with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress, but
cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical
application at the 30 mg/d dose studied in this trial.

## Introduction
Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in a majority of patients with Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Agitation refers to emotional distress, excessive psychomotor
activity, aggressive behaviors, disruptive irritability, and disinhibition.
Agitation is common, persistent, difficult to treat, costly, and associated with
severe adverse consequences for patients and caregivers 1 – 5 .
Psychological, environmental and pharmacologic therapies have proven inadequate.
Antipsychotics continue to be widely used for agitation, despite serious safety
concerns, including increased mortality, and uncertain efficacy 5 – 10 .

Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is frequently
used in older individuals 11 – 12 and has been suggested as an
alternative to antipsychotic drugs for agitation and aggression in
dementia 13 – 16 . Yet, there is limited evidence
for its efficacy and safety. In a short-term, unmasked study and two randomized,
masked follow-up studies, Pollock and colleagues demonstrated the utility of
citalopram for agitation in dementia, but these preliminary data require replication
in a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specific to an AD
population 17 – 19 .

The primary objective of the Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease
Study (CitAD) was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for agitation in patients
with AD and without major depression. Secondary objectives were 3-fold: (1) examine
the effects of citalopram on patients' functional abilities, and on caregiver
distress; (2) examine the safety of citalopram comparing treatment groups on vital
signs, weight, gait stability, cognitive effects, side effects, electrolyte panels,
adverse event reports, and ECG (added later during the study); and (3) examine
predictors of citalopram response. This paper will address the primary objective and
item 1 and 2 of the secondary objectives.

## Methods
The CitAD study was an investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-arm, parallel group trial funded by the
National Institute on Aging (NIA) with additional funding provided by the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). CitAD enrolled patients from eight
academic centers in the US and Canada. The study design including complete
eligibility criteria, data collection schedule and detailed statistical analysis
was previously reported 20 .

CitAD had an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The
study protocol and amendments were approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRB)
or Research Ethics Board (REB) at each clinical center and the coordinating
center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and
informants based on local IRB requirements regarding capacity to consent and
surrogate consent. Generic citalopram was purchased and over-encapsulated for
use in this study.

All clinical center personnel and participants were masked to treatment
assignment. Unmasking occurred routinely at the week 9 visit after data
collection was complete, enabling study physicians and participants to make
informed decisions about continued treatment 20 .

CitAD participants had probable AD by National Institute of Neurological
and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders
Association 21 criteria
with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 22 scores from 5–28 inclusive, and had
“clinically significant agitation” for which a physician
determined that medication was appropriate and was rated as 1) occurring `very
frequently' or 2) occurring `frequently' with `moderate' or `marked' severity on
the agitation/aggression domain (one screening question that if answered yes
proceeds to 8 subquestions) of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 23 . Participants were excluded if
they had a major depressive episode or psychosis requiring antipsychotic
treatment. A caregiver who spent at least several hours a week with the patient
was required to supervise medications and participate in outcomes assessments.
Medications for the treatment of AD (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) at
stable doses within the month preceding randomization were allowed. Withdrawal
of psychotropic medications other than pre-defined rescue medications was
required. Adequate previous treatment or contraindication to citalopram was
exclusionary. Prolonged QT interval on ECG was later added as an exclusion
criterion (see below). Race and ethnicity were self-reported based on categories
defined by the National Institutes of Health.

Participants received identically appearing citalopram or placebo
capsules allocated in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by clinical center. Target dose of
citalopram was 30 mg/day as a single dose in the morning, with planned titration
over 3 weeks from a starting dose of 10 mg with subsequent dose changes based on
response and tolerability. Lorazepam (0.5 mg daily) and trazodone (≤ 50
mg nightly) were permitted as `rescue' medications for significant agitation or
sleep disturbance.

On August 22, 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an
advisory regarding dose-dependent risk of QT prolongation with citalopram
therapy 24 .
Consequently, the CitAD Steering Committee amended the protocol to exclude
individuals with QTc > 450ms for men and >475ms for women at
screening, to include an ECG at week 3 and at the visit after dose increase to
30 mg for those on slower titration, and added serum magnesium to routine
electrolyte monitoring.

In order to ensure all study patients and caregivers received
appropriate standard of care and to limit potentially variable effects of
individual site interactions with the participants and caregivers, a trained
study clinician conducted a standardized and practical psychosocial intervention
consisting of three components: provision of educational materials; 24-hour
availability for crisis management; and a 20 – 30 minute counseling
session at each of the scheduled study visits including the design of a
supportive care plan during the randomization visit, review and adjustment of
the supportive care plan at subsequent visits, emotional support and an
opportunity to ventilate feelings, counseling regarding specific caregiving
skills, and assistance with problem-solving of specific issues brought up by the
caregiver or study participant 20 .

Primary efficacy outcome measures were the agitation subscale of the
Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS-A) 25 (range: 0, 18; higher scores indicate more severe
symptoms) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global
Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC) 26 (range 1–7 where 1 indicates marked improvement and
7 indicates marked worsening from baseline). The NBRS-A assesses agitation,
hostility/uncooperativeness, and disinhibition. The clinician-administered
mADCS-CGIC was modified to assess items specific to agitation in AD, producing a
global rating of change in agitation and a measure of clinical significance.

Secondary efficacy outcomes were the Neuropsychiatric Inventory
(NPI) 23 (frequency by
severity range: 0, 144; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms), individual
NPI domain ratings, NPI caregiver distress ratings (range: 0, 60; higher scores
indicate more severe distress), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory
(CMAI) 27 (range: 14,
70; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms), the Alzheimer Disease
Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) 28 (range: 0, 78; higher scores
indicate better functioning), and cumulative lorazepam dose. Important secondary
safety outcomes included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 22 (range: 0, 30; higher scores
indicate better functioning), a measure of cognitive abilities, and the Get Up
and Go (GUG) 29 , assessing
mobility and gait, and elicitation of adverse events using both symptom
checklists and open-ended questions.

Primary assessment of efficacy was based on intention-to-treat (ITT)
comparison of the difference in the NBRS-A scores at week 9 and comparison at
week 9 for the mADCS-CGIC. Crude between-treatment difference at week 9 NBRS-A
scores was assessed using a t-test. Adjusted differences were assessed using
mixed effects regression models with a random intercept for patient, indicators
for each visit, treatment by visit interactions, and covarying for baseline
NBRS-A scores and baseline MMSE (due to baseline imbalance). The difference in
the linear slope of NBRS-A scores over all study visits was also estimated using
mixed effects regression. All available visit data for the 186 participants were
incorporated into the NBRS-A model. Other continuous scale scores were modeled
in the same way.

We also performed sensitivity analyses for the NBRS-A outcome: 1) using
generalized estimating equations (GEE) model for mean visit scores with
unstructured covariance structure for within-person longitudinal measurements
and robust standard errors for effect estimates 30 .

The mADCS-CGIC ratings of change (“marked worsening” to
“marked improvement” on a 7 point scale) at week 9 were compared
between treatment groups including all participants with week 9 mADCS-CGIC data
using proportional odds logistic regression 31 . We performed sensitivity analyses for the mADCS-CGIC
outcome by using multiple imputation to estimate missing week 9 data.

The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events was compared
between treatment groups using Fisher's exact test for small cells (unadjusted),
or logistic regression, adjusting for baseline report of the same symptom if
necessary due to baseline imbalance. Adherence was assessed by pill counts from
returned medication bottles using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Statistical analyses used SAS version 9.2 and R version 2.13.1. All
p-values are two-sided and p < .05 was the threshold for statistical
significance. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

A detailed description of the power calculations has been
published 20 . For the
NBRS-A, the study was designed to have 85% power to detect a standardized
difference at week 9 of 40% for citalopram compared to placebo. For the
mADCS-CGIC proportional odds analysis, the study was designed to have power
greater than 80% to detect a difference of 20% between citalopram and placebo in
the proportions of patients who improve (or worsen).

## Results
186 participants were enrolled between August 2009 and January 2013, 94
assigned to citalopram and 92 to placebo. We intended to enroll 200 participants
per protocol by December 31, 2012 but recruitment slowed notably towards the end
of this timeframe. Figure 1 summarizes
patient recruitment, participation and attrition. Baseline characteristics were
similar ( Table 1 ), except participants on
placebo had lower mean MMSE scores. Participants were on average in their late
70s, 46% female, two-thirds white and non-Hispanic, community dwelling, and
diagnosed with dementia for 5 years. About two-thirds took cholinesterase
inhibitors and just over 40% took memantine. Over 90 % of both groups completed
the 9 week trial and about 80% remained on treatment. At week 9, 78% of the
sample were receiving 30 mg citalopram daily and 15 % were receiving 20 mg
citalopram daily.

Participants on citalopram showed significant improvement compared with
placebo on both primary outcome measures ( Table
2 ). The raw NBRS-A scores are shown in Figure 2 ; at week 9 the unadjusted mean scores were 4.1 (SD = 3.0)
on citalopram and 5.4 (SD= 3.2) on placebo (crude difference = 1.3 [95% CI: 2.6,
3.5]; p = 0.010). The mixed model estimated difference in week 9 NBRS-A scores
for citalopram – placebo was −0.93 [95% CI: −1.80 to
−0.06] p = 0.036 (negative numbers favor citalopram). The model estimated
differences in scores at the two interim visits were: −0.58 (95% CI:
−1.44, 0.29); p = 0.190 at week 3; and −1.12 (95% CI:
−1.98, −0.26); p = 0.012 at week 6. The estimated difference in
linear slopes over all study visits is −0.12 (95% CI: −0.22,
−0.02); p = 0.022. Results for the NBRS-A were virtually identical for
the GEE model; the GEE estimated difference in week 9 scores was: −0.94
(−1.80, −0.07); p = 0.033

mADCS-CGIC results showed that 40% of citalopram participants had
moderate or marked improvement from baseline severity vs. 26% of placebo
participants, with an estimated treatment effect from the proportional odds
model including participants with week 9 data (odds ratio of being at or better
than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 [95% CI: 1.23 to 3.69], p = 0.007. The
estimated OR for the sensitivity analysis including imputed values for missing
data was 2.10 [95% CI:1.21 to 3.64].

Relative to placebo, citalopram was associated with improved scores on
CMAI with an estimated difference in week 9 scores of −2.38 [95% CI
−4.13 to −0.63], p = 0.008. On the NPI total score, estimated
differences for citalopram over placebo in week 9 scores were −6.03 [95%
CI: −10.75 to −1.32], p = 0.013; on the NPI agitation subscale,
−0.78 [95% CI: −1.77 to 0.21], p = 0.123; and on NPI caregiver
distress, −2.70 [95% CI: −4.94 to −0.47], p = 0.018. There
was no significant difference between groups on the ADCS-ADL scale. There was no
difference between the two treatment groups in the use of rescue lorazepam
( Table 2 ).

There was no difference in adherence between the two study groups. MMSE
results showed greater cognitive worsening with citalopram, −1.05 points
[95% CI: −1.97 to −0.13], p = 0.026 ( Table 2 ). Anorexia, diarrhea and fever were more common on
citalopram and weight loss and insomnia on placebo ( Table 3 ). Falls were more frequent on citalopram, and
remained even after controlling for baseline differences. An increase in upper
respiratory infections was also noted in the citalopram group. The citalopram
group may have shown a slight increase in gait impairment as measured by the
GUG, but the rate of hyponatremia did not differ appreciably between the groups.
Frequency of serious adverse events was comparable between treatment groups
( supplemental table
1 ). There was one death in the placebo group.

ECG monitoring was initiated after 138 patients were randomized and was
available for 48 patients (24 citalopram and 24 placebo). Citalopram was
associated with greater increase in QTc interval than placebo, 18.1 ms [95% CI:
6.1, 30.1], p = 0.004, and more participants on citalopram than placebo showed a
> 30 ms QTc increase from enrollment to week 3 (7 versus 1; Fisher's
exact p = 0.046). Three citalopram and one placebo participants showed QTc
prolongation (> 450ms for men and > 475ms for women).

## Discussion
Citalopram treatment led to a reduction in agitation in patients with AD.
The effect size is clinically relevant: 40% of citalopram-treated participants were
judged to be much or very much improved on mADCS-CGIC vs. 26% of those on placebo.
Adverse events were generally modest and consistent with known SSRI-mediated adverse
events (increases in gastrointestinal complaints, respiratory tract infections, and
falls), except that no weight loss or hyponatremia was seen. The cognitive worsening
and QT interval prolongation observed in the citalopram group raise concern about
the 30 mg/d dose used in this study and may limit the clinical utility of the
findings.

Safe and effective treatments for agitation remain elusive with options
limited. Patients in this trial had substantial, disruptive behavioral symptoms at
the same level or higher than patients with AD who received antipsychotics in the
CATIE-AD study, 7 , 16 other studies of atypical antipsychotics for
dementia, 6 and in trials of
donepezil and memantine as primary treatments of agitation 32 – 33 .
Improvement over the course of the trial as measured by total NPI scores was
comparable to that of antipsychotics in other trials 6 – 7 , 16 and improvement on the mADCS-CGIC
was superior in CitAD. The consistency of outcomes on other scales lends credibility
and clinical significance to the trial's outcome that 30 mg/d of citalopram improved
agitation. Similar to previous studies we saw a robust rating scales response on
placebo 6 .

We used the MMSE to monitor for cognitive changes that might be adversely
affected by treatment. Greater cognitive decline was seen in the citalopram group
over 9 weeks. MMSE scores modestly improved on placebo but worsened on citalopram,
with no difference in spontaneously reported somnolence or confusion. The MMSE
treatment effect, approximately 1 point, is similar to the mean worsening of 0.73
points with antipsychotics in similarly designed trials 6 but lower than the minimum clinically significant
change of 1.4 points considered by many experts 38 . This finding is consistent with another study reporting
declines in verbal learning and psychomotor speed in patients taking
citalopram 34 , and with
prior epidemiological data 35 .
Conversely citalopram at 20 mg/d showed significant improvement on the cognitive
subscale of the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS) in one of the preliminary
citalopram studies 18 and the
DIADS-2 study indicated that another SSRI, sertraline, neither improved nor impaired
cognitive function in patients with depression of Alzheimer's disease 39 . Therefore, while citalopram had a
small negative impact on cognitive functioning in this study, its clinical
significance is uncertain. Also unknown are whether this cognitive effect continues
beyond 9-weeks, and whether citalopram adversely effects the course of AD.

The QT interval prolongation observed here is consistent with the FDA
advisory 24 and
citalopram's current prescribing information. We maintained a 30 mg/day target dose
of citalopram after the FDA advisory and our findings suggest that 30 mg/day in
patients with AD should generally be avoided. Current prescribing information
recommends a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of citalopram for patients over 60 years of
age because of substantially higher exposures, decreased clearance, and prolonged
cardiac repolarization potential 37 . Our trial did not have enough patients treated with 20 mg/day to
assess the efficacy of that dose.

Strengths of the study include: 1) randomized treatment assignment with
inclusion of placebo control; 2) double blind treatment assignment with rigorous
adherence to masked rating; 3) high retention rates (>90% over 9 weeks) and
adherence to study drug; 4) careful definition of agitation of moderate or higher
severity; 5) relatively few medical or medication exclusions resulting in a study
population that is broadly representative of AD patients; 6) semi-structured
psychosocial intervention administered to all patients and caregivers; 7) consistent
results across sites supporting generalizability; 8) consistent findings across
multiple measures of agitation and analysis methods.

Limitations of the study include: 1) participants comprised a sample of
convenience in US and Canadian academic medical centers that may not generalize to
other settings; 2) short duration of treatment; 3) unknown effectof citalopram on
agitation in non-AD forms of dementia; 4) unknown effectof citalopram in the more
mild and more severe forms of agitation or in inpatient settings; 5) no dose ranging
information; 6) baseline differences in the MMSE; 7) absence of more comprehensive
assessment of cognition; 8) lack of data collection on potential participants who
declined to participate or failed screening.

Identifying drugs outside the antipsychotic class with targeted
anti-agitation effects that provide greater benefit or lower risk among patients
with Alzheimer's disease is a research priority. While citalopram, at 30 mg
daily, was associated with clinically meaningful reduction in agitation in
patients with AD over 9 weeks of treatment comparable to what is seen with
antipsychotics, citalopram showed mild cognitive and concerning cardiac adverse
effects, and cannot be generally recommended as an alternative treatment option
at that dose. There are insufficient data, however on efficacy for agitation at
lower doses. An assessment of individual patient circumstances, including
symptom severity, value of improvement, cognitive function and change, cardiac
conduction, vulnerability to adverse effects, and effectiveness of behavioral
interventions can help guide appropriate medication use in patients with marked
agitation or aggression.
