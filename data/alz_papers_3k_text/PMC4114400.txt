Amyloid-betainhibits E-S Potentiation through suppression of cannabinoid receptor 1-dependent synaptic disinhibition

# Abstract
It has been widely reported that β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synapses. Here we show evidence that Aβ more potently blocks the potentiation of excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) -spike coupling (E-S potentiation). This occurs not by direct effect on excitatory synapses or postsynaptic neurons, but rather through a novel indirect mechanism: reduction of endocannabinoid-mediated peri-tetanic disinhibition. During high frequency (tetanic) stimulation, somatic synaptic inhibition is suppressed by endocannabinoids. We find that Aβ prevents this endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition, thus leaving synaptic inhibition more intact during tetanic stimulation. This intact inhibition opposes the normal depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons that occurs during tetanus, thus opposing the induction of synaptic plasticity. Thus, a novel pathway through which Aβ can act to modulate neural activity is identified, relevant to learning and memory and how it may mediate aspects of the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease.

## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typically affecting the elderly, is characterized clinically by cognitive decline leading to severe impairment and eventually death. Studies show that it is associated with key pathologies termed beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as a severe loss of neurons and brain volume. Studies in both human patients and animal models of AD point to over-accumulation of soluble oligomers of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) as a mediator of learning and memory impairments early in the disease (for review, see ( Hoe et al., 2012 ; Rowan et al., 2005 ; Selkoe, 2008 )).

In this context, the effects of Aβ on long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission have been widely studied. LTP is the persistent increase in the strength of synaptic transmission that occurs at synapses that have been briefly activated at high frequency (e.g. 100 Hz for 1 sec.). It remains the most compelling model for a learning mechanism at the synaptic level ( Bliss and Collingridge, 1993 ). In general, application of sub-micro molar concentrations of Aβ to hippocampal tissue has been reported to result in a reduction in LTP ( Chen et al., 2000 ; Cullen et al., 1997 ; Freir et al., 2001 ; Gengler et al., 2007 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Klyubin et al., 2004 ; Kroker et al., 2013 ; Lambert et al., 1998 ; Nomura et al., 2005 ; Nomura et al., 2012 ; Rammes et al., 2011 ; Raymond et al., 2003 ; Ronicke et al., 2008 ; Rowan et al., 2004 ; Townsend et al., 2006b ; Vitolo et al., 2002 ; Walsh et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2002a ; Wang et al., 2004b ) leading to speculation that this is a critical path by which Aβ may impair learning and/or memory.

In our initial studies on the effects of Aβ, we noted that this amyloid peptide seemed to be much more effective in blocking potentiation of the hippocampal population spike than it was blocking LTP of synaptic transmission. This suggested that a primary effect of Aβ might be to block potentiation of EPSP-spike coupling, or E-S potentiation. E-S potentiation is another form of activity-dependent potentiation that is induced concurrently with synaptic LTP. It is a strengthening of the apparent electrical coupling between the dendritic synaptic inputs and the soma, such that a greater proportion of the EPSP survives at the spike trigger zone, resulting in greater action potential output for a given synaptic input ( Abraham et al., 1985 ; Bliss and Lomo, 1973 ; Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Daoudal and Debanne, 2003 ; Hanse, 2008 ; Jester et al., 1995 ; Taube and Schwartzkroin, 1988 ; Wilson, 1981 ). This potentiation of EPSP-spike (E-S) coupling provides an additional boost to the efficacy of the EPSP on top of the potentiation (LTP) that occurs at the synapse ( Bliss and Lomo, 1973 ). In essence, LTP makes the EPSP larger, and E-S potentiation makes a greater proportion of that EPSP survive to the spike trigger zone at the axon hillock.

Although LTP and E-S potentiation are mechanistically distinct processes, they may share some features besides the fact that both are induced by high frequency synaptic activation. There is some evidence that E-S potentiation may in some circumstances require activation of the NMDA-receptor ( Breakwell et al., 1996 ; Jester et al., 1995 ), although others have reported no involvement of this receptor ( Bernard and Wheal, 1995a ; Raymond et al., 2003 ). Activation of a metabotropic glutamate receptor has also been implicated ( Breakwell et al., 1996 ). Like LTP, E-S potentiation is strongly influenced by the state of GABAergic synaptic inhibition, with stronger inhibition opposing E-S potentiation ( Bernard and Wheal, 1995b ; Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Daoudal et al., 2002 ; Staff and Spruston, 2003 ; Tomasulo et al., 1991 ). Whether the influence of GABAergic transmission is limited to the induction of E-S potentiation, or is also involved in its expression remains an open question ( Chavez-Noriega et al., 1990 ; Jester et al., 1995 ; Kairiss et al., 1987 ). In this paper we examine the effects of Aβ on E-S potentiation and reveal a novel signaling mechanism for this amyloid peptide involving the suppression of endocannabinoid-mediated peri-tetanic disinhibition during the induction of LTP and E-S potentiation.

## Results
While attempting to replicate the previously reported suppression of LTP by Aβ (Aβ1-42), using extracellular field potential recording in stratum radiatum of area CA1 in hippocampal slices (see Fig. 1A ), we noted that LTP was suppressed only modestly by bath application of Aβ1-42 (500 nM), most prominently when a `weak' inducing stimulus (5 bursts of 4 stimuli with 400 ms interburst intervals. Fig. 1B ), and to a lesser amount when a `strong' tetanic induction protocol (3 one-second duration trains at 100 Hz with inter-train interval of 15 s, Fig. 1C , Supplementary Figure 1 ) was used to induce plasticity. However, upon closer examination, we noticed that Aβ strongly altered the tetanus-induced change in the population spike. This suggested to us that the main effect of Aβ might be on potentiation of the coupling between the EPSP and somatic action potential rather than on synaptic transmission itself, and led us to examine the effects of Aβ on E-S potentiation. E-S potentiation is induced by the same tetanic stimuli as LTP, and so is generally co-expressed with LTP ( Abraham et al., 1985 ; Bliss and Lomo, 1973 ; Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Taube and Schwartzkroin, 1988 ; Wilson, 1981 ; Wilson et al., 1981 ). To measure E-S coupling and potentiation of that coupling, we compared stimulus-evoked synaptic transmission via the field EPSP (fEPSP; Fig. 1C ) with the simultaneously recorded action potential discharge of the postsynaptic neurons via the population spike ( Fig. 1D ). The ratio of population spike area and the fEPSP rising slope give a measure of E-S coupling ( Fig. 1E ). In these experiments, LTP and E-S potentiation were induced by application of the `strong' tetanic stimulation protocol. On average, in the experiments illustrated in Fig.1 , this produced 146% [±13] potentiation of the fEPSP ( Fig. 1C ), and a 555% [±74] potentiation of population spike area in untreated slices ( Fig. 1D ). This outsized increase in the population spike does not simply represent a non-unity or non-linearity in the E-S coupling between the EPSP and the population spike, but rather includes E-S potentiation, because decreasing the stimulus to reduce the fEPSP back to its baseline size still produced a population spike greater than control (not shown). While application of 500 nM of synthetic Aβ1-42 peptide, beginning 20 minutes before tetanic stimulation, caused no significant reduction in the potentiation of the fEPSP slope ( Fig. 1C ), it did significantly reduce potentiation of the population spike ( Fig. 1D ) and thus, reduced E-S potentiation ( Fig. 1E ). Note that Aβ had no effect on basal, non-potentiated fEPSPs, population spikes or E-S coupling ( Fig. 1F ). In most series of experiments done for this paper, there was a trend toward less LTP in the presence of Aβ, but this apparent trend never reached a level of statistical significance with an n value of experiments for which robust changes in plasticity are generally detectable. Given the strong evidence in the literature that Aβ can reduce LTP, we examined this trend further by combining all experiments done during the course of this study where the effects of Aβ were compared to control. With this much larger cohort of experiments, the effects of Aβ on LTP just barely reached significance (P=0.0494, Supplementary Figure S1 ). The effects on E-S potentiation were, on the other hand, much more robust. Whereas Aβ potently impaired E-S potentiation when applied before plasticity induction, it had no effect on LTP of the fEPSP, population spike or E-S potentiation when applied beginning immediately after tetanic stimulation ( Fig. 2A–C ). These results indicate that Aβ impairs some mechanism during induction, but not maintenance or expression of E-S potentiation. A comparison of E-S potentiation (35–40 minutes after tetanus) with Aβ applied before or after the tetanic stimulation is shown in Fig. 2D .

E-S coupling has been previously shown to be influenced largely by two distinct factors: the intrinsic leakiness of the dendrites and soma ( Staff and Spruston, 2003 ), and synaptic inhibition ( Bernard and Wheal, 1995a ; Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Daoudal et al., 2002 ; Staff and Spruston, 2003 ; Tomasulo et al., 1991 ). Both factors shunt a portion of the synaptic current generated in the dendrite across the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, reducing synaptically driven depolarization at the spike trigger zone in the soma and axon hillock. To test for a role of synaptic inhibition, we applied the GABA A receptor open-channel blocker picrotoxin (50 μM) beginning 1 hour before tetanic stimulation. Any potentiation of E-S coupling that occurs in the presence of picrotoxin would be independent of GABA A receptor-mediated processes.

Blockade of synaptic inhibition by picrotoxin alone caused an increase in E-S coupling in agreement with numerous previous publications ( Abraham et al., 1987 ; Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Daoudal et al., 2002 ; Tomasulo et al., 1991 ; Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ). Upon application of picrotoxin, the fEPSP rising slope remained the same, but the population spike grew markedly as expected (c.f. ( Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ). In order to avoid saturation of the population spike upon subsequent potentiation, the stimulus strength was decreased to match the population spike area as closely as possible with control values. Tetanization in the presence of picrotoxin resulted in potentiation of the fEPSP that was no different than control, but potentiation of the population spike was diminished compared to control without picrotoxin ( Fig. 3A, B ). Thus, picrotoxin alone reduced the amount of E-S potentiation ( Fig 3C ) presumably by occluding it.

Aβ, applied in the presence of picrotoxin, had no further effect on LTP of either the fEPSP ( Fig 3A ), the population spike ( Fig 3B ), or E-S potentiation ( Fig. 3C ). Thus, the Aβ-sensitive suppression of population spike potentiation and the resulting reduction in E-S potentiation seems to have been completely occluded by the prior addition of picrotoxin, suggesting that it is entirely mediated through an action associated with the GABA A receptor. These results further suggest that there is no effect of Aβ on non-GABA-related factors that might participate in E-S potentiation, such as dendritic `leakiness”. While the exact nature of the interaction between GABAergic mechanisms and Aβ was unclear at this point, the fact that they did interact suggested that we should examine this relationship more directly.

To examine directly the mechanism of this interaction between Aβ and synaptic inhibition, we observed the actions of Aβ on inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) recorded intracellularly. Stimulus-evoked IPSPs were recorded using sharp-microelectrode intracellular recording of the membrane voltage of CA1 pyramidal neurons. While Aβ had no effect on amplitude of baseline IPSPs ( Fig. 4D ) or on postsynaptic resting membrane potential ( Fig. 4E ), it had a dramatic effect on IPSPs recorded immediately following tetanic stimulation ( Fig. 4A ). In the absence of Aβ, tetanic stimulation caused a transient disinhibition, seen as a suppression of the IPSP in the first 1–5 minutes after the tetanic stimulation, which recovered back to near baseline level within 10 minutes. This transient disinhibition was largely absent when tetanic stimulation was delivered in the presence of Aβ ( Fig. 4A ).

Aβ-sensitive post-tetanic disinhibition was reminiscent of the well-characterized phenomenon of Depolarization-induced Suppression of Inhibition (DSI) ( Alger et al., 1996 ; Castillo et al., 2012 ; Pitler and Alger, 1994 ; Wilson and Nicoll, 2001 ), which is known to be mediated by endocannabinoids released from postsynaptic pyramidal neurons acting on cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) present on inhibitory presynaptic terminals. DSI is triggered by postsynaptic depolarization, so it seemed an intriguing idea that tetanic depolarization of the postsynaptic cell would trigger a similar cannabinoid release and thus, that the post-tetanic disinhibition we observed might also be cannabinoid-mediated. To test this hypothesis, we applied 2 μM of AM251, an antagonist and inverse agonist to the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R), prior to tetanization to see if it would block post-tetanic disinhibition. Like Aβ, AM251 application did prevent post-tetanic disinhibition ( Fig. 4B ). Whereas control slices again showed robust suppression of inhibition immediately following tetanus, those pretreated with AM251 showed no post-tetanic disinhibition ( Fig. 4B ). Thus, it appears that Aβ suppresses post-tetanic disinhibition that is mediated through endocannabinoid receptor, CB1R.

If this blockade of disinhibition occurs not just following but during the tetanic stimulation, it would be expected to influence the amount of postsynaptic depolarization that happens during the tetanic induction of LTP and E-S potentiation. With inhibition intact during tetanus (i.e. no disinhibition), there should be less depolarization of the membrane potential during that tetanic stimulation. Examination of the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons during tetanic stimulation revealed that Aβ-treated neurons underwent less depolarization during the tetanus than did vehicle controls ( Fig. 4C ). Indeed, in the presence of Aβ, membrane potentials were actually hyperpolarized during the initial portion of the tetanic stimulation, while in the absence of Aβ, the membrane potential depolarized substantially during the entire tetanic stimulation. Such a peri-tetanic suppression of disinhibition, and thus a diminished depolarization during tetanic stimulation would be expected to blunt the induction of synaptic plasticity ( Gustafsson et al., 1987 ; Malinow and Miller, 1986 ).

If Aβ mediates its blockade of peri-tetanic disinhibition by interrupting the action of the endocannabinoid pathway, then CB1R antagonists should have the same effect on E-S potentiation as Aβ, and Aβ should have no further effect in the presence of CB1R antagonists. Previous work has shown that the CB1R antagonist AM251 prevents E-S potentiation in a manner that appears similar to our results with Aβ ( Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003 ) and it has also been previously shown that endocannabinoid-mediated DSI was important in the for the induction of LTP ( Carlson et al., 2002 ). Therefore, we compared the effects of AM251 on the E-S potentiation in the presence and absence of Aβ. AM251 (2 μM) alone produced little or no effect on LTP of the fEPSP in our experiments ( Fig. 5A ) although others have shown more AM251 efficacy against LTP ( Carlson et al., 2002 ). AM251 did suppress potentiation of the population spike and thus of E-S coupling ( Fig. 5B, C , see also ( Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003 )) in a manner identical to Aβ (cf. Fig. 1C–E ). Application of Aβ in the presence of AM251 produced no additional reduction in potentiation of the fEPSP, the population spike, or E-S potentiation ( Fig. 5D–F ). Thus, we conclude that Aβ and the cannabinoid system participate in a common pathway, modulating post-tetanic disinhibition to influence the induction of E-S potentiation. Endocannabinoids produce peri-tetanic disinhibition, while Aβ prevents that disinhibition.

While the previous experiments strongly suggest that Aβ and endocannabinoids are acting on a common mechanism, peri-tetanic disinhibition, those experiments do not necessarily prove that Aβ is working directly on the endocannabinoid system to suppress disinhibition. If, for example, post-tetanic disinhibition required the coordinated action of two different factors, both necessary but neither sufficient, (with one of these factors being activation of CB1R), then blockade of either CB1R or that second, unspecified Aβ-sensitive factor would produce the same results that we report. We needed an experiment to test whether Aβ was working directly on the endocannabinoid system. Therefore, we tested whether Aβ blocks classical cannabinoid-dependent DSI ( Castillo et al., 2012 ). In Fig. 6 , spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in whole-cell configuration ( Cohen et al., 1992 ; Doze et al., 1991 , 1995 ). These IPSCs arise from a combination of quantal synaptic release of GABA from inhibitory terminals and action potential-dependent release evoked by the spontaneous action potential discharge of inhibitory interneurons. Both types of events are mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA primarily through action on the postsynaptic GABA A receptor ( Doze et al., 1991 ).

DSI was induced by briefly stepping the holding potential of the pyramidal neuron from −60 to 0 mV for a few seconds and then back to −60 mV ( Wilson and Nicoll, 2001 ). Figure 6A shows an individual neuron held in voltage clamp at −60 mV, depolarized to 0 VM for ~5 seconds, and then repolarized to the −60 mV holding potential. DSI lasting several seconds is apparent as the suppression of the amplitude of sIPSCs immediately after the depolarization. Figure 6B shows the average amplitude of sIPSCs in 12 pyramidal neurons, in one-second duration bins for 10 seconds before and 15 seconds after the depolarization. Statistically significant DSI occurred in controls, but in the presence of Aβ there was no significant difference in the spontaneous IPSCs before and after depolarization. Note that DSI occurred in less than half of the pyramidal neurons we tested and we only applied Aβ to those cells where it was detected.

While Aβ is clearly working to block the action of endocannabinoids as evinced by the blockade of DSI ( Fig. 6 ), the mechanism of this blockade remains to be elucidated. There are two major possible mechanisms that may underlie this blockade, the first being that Aβ blocks the production of endocannabinoids and the second being that it blocks their action. To differentiate between these possibilities we tested the efficacy of Aβ in blocking the disinhibitory action of an exogenous cannabinoid agonist. The potent and selective CB1R agonist ACPA (arachidonylcyclopropylamide) was bath applied at 20 μM to hippocampal slices, while recording spontaneous IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Fig. 7A1 ). In 9 of 13 experiments, ACPA caused a marked suppression of the amplitude and apparent frequency of the spontaneous IPSCs (with no discernible effect in the other 4/13). In the 9 experiments where ACPA showed activity against the spontaneous IPSCs, we subsequently applied Aβ in the continued presence of ACPA. This addition of Aβ caused a recovery of the spontaneous IPSC amplitude to a level not significantly different from baseline ( Fig. 7B, C ). Note also that when this experiment was repeated in reverse order, with Aβ applied first, followed by application of ACPA, the agonist-induced suppression of the IPSCs was prevented. Because these experiment use an exogenous ligand, and thus bypass physiological endocannabinoid production, they demonstrate that Aβ is working not by reducing production of endocannabinoids, but rather by blocking the CB1R-mediated action of endocannabinoids. Aβ is not, however exerting this effect by antagonizing cannabinoid binding to the CB1R, as Aβ did not displace labeled antagonist ( 3 H-Rimonabant, SR141716) from the receptor in a competition binding assay ( Fig. S2 )( Farrens et al., 2002 ). Therefore, it is likely working on a mechanism downstream from ligand binding to the receptor.

## Discussion
The literature on the effects of Aβ on LTP of hippocampal synaptic transmission reveals mixed results. Some laboratories have reported a robust inhibition of LTP by Aβ ( Chen et al., 2000 ; Cullen et al., 1997 ; Freir et al., 2001 ; Townsend et al., 2006a ; Wang et al., 2002b ) while others have shown an Aβ-mediated effect occurring under a more restricted set of circumstances ( Gengler et al., 2007 ; Ronicke et al., 2008 ; Wang et al., 2004a ). In our experiments we found that weakly induced LTP was modestly reduced by application of Aβ, while LTP induced by a strong stimulus was reduced to a lesser extent ( Gengler et al., 2007 ). Regardless, we established that E-S potentiation is much more sensitive to Aβ than is LTP in our experiments, as it is profoundly inhibited even when using strong inducing stimuli. This suggested to us that the more significant action of Aβ might be on the potentiation of the coupling between the EPSP and the discharge of the soma/axonal action potential.

Importantly, our data support the idea that Aβ does not work directly to inhibit either LTP or E-S potentiation, but rather tends to work indirectly to oppose their induction by limiting the amount of postsynaptic depolarization during tetanic stimulation via the mechanism of suppressing peri-tetanic disinhibition. Disinhibition would be expected to favor the induction of both LTP and E-S potentiation ( Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004 ; Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1983 , 1985 ), since postsynaptic summation of depolarizing EPSPs during the tetanus would be greater in the absence of synaptic inhibition (see Fig. 4C ). By suppressing this disinhibition, thus leaving inhibition intact during the tetanus, Aβ would act to indirectly oppose LTP and E-S potentiation induction. This is consistent with the fact that, as we and others before us have shown, Aβ impairs LTP when weakly, but not strongly induced ( Gengler et al., 2007 ). In our particular experiments, we believe the tetanic induction protocol utilized is strong enough to provide sufficient postsynaptic depolarization in the dendrites to overcome the influence of what is mostly likely to be somatic inhibition ( Alger and Nicoll, 1982 ), rendering the presence of Aβ mostly irrelevant as far as the induction of strong LTP of the EPSP is concerned. This idea is supported by the fact that when using our `strong' induction protocol, we observed no increase in LTP with picrotoxin, which is frequently used to enhance LTP induction ( Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004 ; Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1983 , 1985 ) suggesting that this strongly-induced LTP is not sensitive to the influence of synaptic inhibition ( Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ). Our data do not address whether different forms of LTP are differentially sensitive to Aβ. Several of the prior studies examining the effect of Aβ on LTP used picrotoxin or other GABAergic blockers without preventing Aβ action ( Chen et al., 2000 ; Raymond et al., 2003 ; Rowan et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2002a ; Wang et al., 2004a ; Wang et al., 2004b ), suggesting that there may be possible secondary mechanism through which Aβ might reduce LTP, such as changes in glutamate release, a decrease in postsynaptic glutamate receptors or loss of physical synapses ( Abramov et al., 2009 ; Almeida et al., 2005 ; Chapman et al., 1999 ; Freir et al., 2001 ; Hsieh et al., 2006 ; Kamenetz et al., 2003 ; Shankar et al., 2007 ; Snyder et al., 2005 ; Wei et al., 2010 ). The induction and/or expression of E-S potentiation seems more closely tied to synaptic inhibition ( Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ; Daoudal et al., 2002 ; Tomasulo et al., 1991 ; Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ), and the reduction in E-S potentiation we observed as a result of picrotoxin application ( Fig 3 ) further suggests that this form of plasticity is expressed at least in large part via a persistent reduction in synaptic inhibition. Our data also do not support a role for Aβ in non-inhibition-associated E-S potentiation because the Aβ-sensitive portion of E-S potentiation is completely occluded by the application of picrotoxin in our experiments. We also did not observe any decrease in basal synaptic transmission when applying Aβ. Note however that these previous studies reporting Aβ-induced down-regulation of excitatory synapse number or function have often relied on chronic elevation of Aβ over a significantly longer period of time using, for example, genetic over-expression. Our study is confined to the acute effects of exogenous Aβ applied over a time scale of only tens of minutes. Our data also suggest a means to explain why LTP is less sensitive to Aβ than is E-S potentiation. Because the Aβ-sensitive E-S potentiation induction that we describe here is entirely occluded by the blockade of GABA A receptor channels, the induction site for that portion of E-S potentiation is more likely to be peri-somatic, as opposed to the induction site for LTP, which is clearly dendritic ( Alger and Nicoll, 1982 ; Andersen et al., 1969 ). If this is the case, then LTP would be less sensitive to somatic synaptic inhibition than would E-S potentiation. Indeed, it has been shown that dendritic inhibition is less susceptible to DSI than is somatic inhibition, further supporting this idea ( Morishita and Alger, 2001 ).

Based on our results, we propose a novel mechanism for the action of Aβ on hippocampal plasticity that involves the suppression of cannabinoid-mediated disinhibition via a blockade of the activity of the CB1 receptor. This suppression of disinhibition leaves synaptic inhibition intact, thus opposing the depolarization of the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron during tetanic stimulation of its presynaptic afferents. As such, any effects that Aβ may have on the induction of E-S potentiation or LTP are indirect. Tetanic stimulations that are strong enough to overcome the intact synaptic inhibition will induce full strength LTP, despite the presence of Aβ. Weaker induction protocols will produce LTP that appears to be Aβ-sensitive, because those weaker protocols cannot produce the sufficient postsynaptic depolarization that LTP induction requires in the face of intact synaptic inhibition. E-S potentiation being more closely tied mechanistically and spatially to somatic synaptic inhibition would be more sensitive to Aβ even at higher induction strengths.

The disinhibition that follows tetanic stimulation is transient, and thus exerts a major influence during the induction of E-S potentiation. The particular tetanic stimulation protocol used in this study did not produce a large persistent depression of inhibitory transmission (I-LTD) as reported by others using different inducing stimulus patterns ( Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003 , 2004 ). Even so, our data ( Fig. 4 ) show a small trend to more persistent suppression of the IPSP, which, given the non-linear nature of the relationship between the IPSP and pyramidal cell excitation, may be sufficient to maintain the E-S potentiation that we see. This seems even more likely when considering that pre-application of picrotoxin completely prevented all Aβ-sensitive E-S potentiation from occurring, suggesting that all of this portion of E-S potentiation is related to synaptic inhibition as opposed to other factors. Other factors that may act to maintain the Aβ-sensitive portion of E-S potentiation are not addressed by our experiments. However, we can say they do not include a change in the resting membrane potential ( Fig 4E ) or the properties of non-synaptic electrical shunts in the dendrites, since there is no Aβ-sensitive E-S potentiation that survives picrotoxin application. They also do not reflect a change in the underlying excitatory synaptic potential, since neither it, nor its potentiation is sufficiently affected by Aβ, at least in cases of strong LTP induction. Possibilities for additional factors that contribute to the maintenance of E-S potentiation might include persistent changes in the action potential threshold of the postsynaptic cell, changes in electrical or ephaptic coupling of pyramidal cells, or changes in tonic synaptic inhibition ( Chavez-Noriega et al., 1989 ). Likewise, our data indicate that Aβ is blocking the activity of cannabinoids through the CB1R, but that Aβ is not acting as a classical receptor antagonist. Thus we conclude that Aβ antagonizes CB1R activity at a site downstream from the receptor ( Chevaleyre et al., 2007 ; Yu et al., 2012 ).

It is well known from previous work that CB1 receptor block results in impairment of hippocampal dependent learning and memory (for review, see ( Davies et al., 2002 ). The mechanism by which Aβ disables the effects of cannabinoids on synaptic inhibition, and thus disrupts plasticity, may explain learning and memory deficits in AD that occur in otherwise healthy neural circuits prior to AD-related neuronal cell death. Changes in neuronal circuitry of the hippocampus have been reported long before appearance of the signal sign of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques ( Hsia et al., 1999 ), and impaired cannabinoid signaling may play a role in that aspect of the neuropathology ( Aso et al., 2012 ; Gowran et al., 2011 ; Haghani et al., 2012a ; Haghani et al., 2012b ; Stumm et al., 2013 ). The present discovery of an explicit role for Aβ in suppressing cannabinoid function elucidates a substrate of Alzheimer's pathology. Thus, this newfound knowledge may advance understanding of the causes of Alzheimer's symptomatology and open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and improvement not only for memory in the earlier stages of the disease, but for the progression of the disease itself.

## Experimental Procedures
All experiments used acutely prepared transverse hippocampal slices from male Wistar rats (P25 to P40) recorded in 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 saturated ACSF (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 6.0 MgSO 4 , 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26.2 NaHCO 3 , and 11.0 glucose) at room temperature (22 °C). Note that other studies have reported that working at similar temperatures does not impair the ability of Aβ1–42 to reduce LTP ( Kroker et al., 2013 ; Nomura et al., 2005 ; Nomura et al., 2012 ; Rammes et al., 2011 ). Slices were prepared by standard methods ( Madison and Nicoll, 1986 ). Field potentials were recorded in the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum of the CA1 area with glass microelectrodes filled with 3M NaCl, having a resistance of approximately 1–2 MOhms. Intracellular recordings of membrane potential were recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells impaled with glass sharp microelectrodes filled with 2M potassium methyl sulfate (ICI Pharmaceuticals), having a resistance of approximately 100–200 MOhms. Both types of glass microelectrode were prepared on a Sutter Instruments P87 micropipette puller. Schaffer collateral/commissural afferent pathway axons were stimulated at a frequency of 0.033 Hz, delivering 100 μs shocks through a concentric bipolar model CBABB75 electrode (Frederick Haer & Co, Bowdoin, ME) placed in stratum radiatum near the CA2/CA1 border. E-S coupling and potentiation were measured by taking the ratio of the area of the population spike over the fEPSP rising slope. Since the population spike is a compound action potential, its amplitude can vary with number of cells firing and the synchrony of their firing. By taking the area of the spike instead of the amplitude, the measurement becomes the sum total of the action potentials of all cells that fired during the field spike regardless of synchrony of firing, and is thus a more accurate measure of excitation of the cell body population than amplitude. Unless otherwise indicated, plasticity was induced with three 1-s trains of stimuli at 100 Hz at test duration and amplitude and an inter-train interval of 15 s. In experiments where stimulus-evoked IPSPs were recorded, the stimulus and the tetanus was identical to that used in field experiments. Data were acquired with Axoclamp 2-A amplifier, amplified with a Brownlee Precision model 200 amplifier, and digitized with a National Instruments analog-to-digital converter, using Labview software. Data were analyzed with a custom-written LabView based program (written by Eric Schiable and Paul Pavlidis). Spontaneous IPSC experiments were acquired on an Axopatch 2A and Axon Instruments Model 1322A A-to-D converter using PClamp 10 software. Statistical significance of LTP experiments was determined by 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures over the entire post-tetanus period (0 to 45 min). Where the significance of individual pair-wise comparisons was made, Student's t-test was used. Picrotoxin and AM251 were obtained from Tocris Cookson, Ballwin, MO.

Picrotoxin, where used, was applied for 1 hour prior to application of tetanic stimulation. Picrotoxin alone caused an increase in the amplitude and area of the population spike, and thus in E-S coupling ( Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ). The stimulus strength was adjusted to give a baseline population spike as close as possible in amplitude and area to those in the non-picrotoxin experiments of Figure 1 . The prior addition of picrotoxin had no effect on the amount of LTP of the fEPSP ( Fig. 3A ), in agreement with previous studies on the effects of GABA A -receptor blockade on strongly-induced LTP ( Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985 ), while reducing E-S potentiation.

We recorded spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents in whole-cell voltage clamp according to the methods previously described ( Cohen et al., 1992 ; Doze et al., 1991 , 1995 ), using a Cs-sulfate-based internal solution with elevated chloride, and in the presence of bath-applied NBQX (10 mM) and AP-5 (50 mM). The contents of the whole-cell electrode internal solution was (mM): 100 CsCH3SO3, 60 CsCl, 5 QX-314 chloride,10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na3GTP (pH 7.3, 275 mOsM). DSI was induced by stepping the holding potential of the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron from −60 mV to 0 mV for a period ranging from ~5 to 12 seconds and then repolarizing it to −60 mV. DSI was recorded in control ACSF, and then after a 10–15 min application of Aβ at 500 nM. In each individual cell, the depolarization was held for the same duration before and after application of Aβ. In spontaneous IPSC experiments, we do not quantify the effect of ACPA or Aβ on the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs because while it appeared to be reduced, this effect is seen as secondary to the decrease in amplitude (i.e. the decrease in amplitude causes the smaller events to drop below detection threshold, resulting in an apparent, but not actual decrease in frequency). Spontaneous IPSC amplitude was analyzed using Synaptisoft software ( Synaptisoft.com ). ACPA (Arachidonylcyclopropylamide, in Tocrisolve 100, Tocris Bioscience) was applied in the bath at 20 μM.

Synthetic Aβ(1–42) was supplied by Elan Pharmaceuticals and stock solutions were prepared as described in Wang et al ( Wang et al., 2008 ),prepared at 50 μM in 0.1% NH 4 OH, aliquoted and frozen. Vials were thawed and diluted to 500 nM in ACSF and applied to slices by superfusion. The vehicle for all Aβ experiments was ACSF with a final concentration of 0.001% NH 4 OH. For all AM251 experiments, vehicle was ACSF with 0.01% DMSO. For experiments where both were applied simultaneously the vehicle contained both NH 4 OH and DMSO.
