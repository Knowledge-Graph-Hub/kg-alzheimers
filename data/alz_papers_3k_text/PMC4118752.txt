The role of clusterin in amyloid-β associated neurodegeneration

# Abstract
Converging evidence indicates that clusterin, a chaperone glycoprotein, influences Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration. However, the precise role of clusterin in AD pathogenesis is still not well understood. To elucidate the relationship between clusterin, amyloid-β (Aβ), p-tau, and rate of brain atrophy over time among non-demented older individuals. A longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal older participants (HC) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) assessed with baseline lumbar puncture and longitudinal structural MRI. Research centers across the United States and Canada. We examined 241 non-demented older individuals (91 participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 and 150 individuals with a CDR of 0.5). Using linear mixed effects models, we investigated interactions between CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 and CSF p-tau 181p on atrophy rate of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Across all participants, we found a significant interaction between CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, but not on hippocampal atrophy rate. CSF clusterin was associated with entorhinal cortex atrophy rate among CSF Aβ 1-42 positive individuals, but not among CSF Aβ 1-42 negative individuals. In secondary analyses, we found significant interactions between CSF Aβ 1-42 and CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 and CSF p-tau 181p on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. We found similar results in subgroup analyses within the MCI and HC cohorts. In non-demented older individuals, Aβ-associated volume loss occurs in the presence of elevated clusterin. The effect of clusterin on Aβ-associated brain atrophy is not confounded or explained by p-tau. These findings implicate a potentially important role for clusterin in the earliest stages of the AD neurodegenerative process and suggest independent effects of clusterin and p-tau on Aβ-associated volume loss.

## Introduction
Converging genetic, cellular, molecular and biomarker evidence indicates that clusterin, a chaperone glycoprotein also known as apolipoprotein J, influences Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Clusterin levels are increased in AD-affected brain regions 1 - 3 and elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. 4 Several genome-wide association studies have identified clusterin gene variants as AD susceptibility loci. 5 Elevated plasma clusterin levels are associated with disease prevalence and severity of AD 6 and with increased amyloid deposition and brain atrophy. 7 Still, experimental findings suggest that clusterin increases both amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation and clearance, 5 raising the question of whether elevated clusterin levels are beneficial or harmful.

In humans, structural MRI and CSF biomarkers allow for the indirect assessment of cellular changes underlying AD in vivo . Structural MRI provides measures of brain atrophy, which includes loss of dendrites, synapses 8 and neurons. 9 Low CSF levels of Aβstrongly correlate with intracranial amyloid plaques and high concentrations of CSF phospho-tau (p-tau) correlate with tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles. 10 Here, we investigated whether interactions between increased CSF clusterin and decreased CSF Aβ 1-42 and increased CSF clusterin and increased CSF p-tau 181p are associated with increased brain atrophy over time in non-demented older individuals at risk for developing AD. Building upon recent evidence that Aβ-associated volume loss occurs in the presence of elevated p-tau, 11 - 15 we also examined the additive effect on volume loss of an interaction between increased CSF clusterin and decreased CSF Aβ 1-42 in the presence of an interaction between increased CSF p-tau 181p and decreased CSF Aβ 1-42 .

## Subjects and Methods
A total of 313 non-demented older participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent longitudinal MRI imaging and CSF lumbar puncture. Of these, we restricted analyses to 91 cognitively normal older adults (HC) and 150 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who had quality-assured baseline and at least one follow-up MRI scan (6 months to 3.5 years, 4% with six month follow-up, 8% with twelve month follow-up, 11% with eighteen month follow-up, 42% with twenty-four month follow-up, and 35% with thirty-six month follow-up) ( Table 1 )(for additional details see Supplemental Material ).

We examined baseline CSF clusterin levels derived from a multiplex-based immunoassay panel based on Luminex immunoassay technology developed by Rules Based Medicine (MyriadRBM). 16 In brief, the ADNI Biomarker Core assessed CSF samples (159 analytes measured by the MyriadRBM) from a total of 327 individuals. These baseline CSF samples had matching aliquots from one year allowing evaluation of test-retest to determine analyte precision. For each analyte, a multi-step quality control procedure was implemented which included evaluation of CSF signal characteristics (high, medium and low), assessment for normality of distribution (not-normal values were transformed) and need for imputation (data with missing values and high/low values) (for additional details on CSF quality control procedures, please see reference 16). We used the quality-controlled values for CSF clusterin in all analyses. Using previously proposed CSF cutoffs 17 we examined baseline CSF Aβ 1-42 and p-tau 181p levels and classified participants based on low (<192 pg/ml, “positive”) and high (>192 pg/ml, “negative”) Aβ 1-42 levels, and high (>23 pg/ml, “positive”) and low (<23 pg/ml, “negative”) p-tau 181p levels. As previously described, 17 CSF Aβ 1-42 and p-tau 181p were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin TX) with Innogenetics (INNOBIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium) immunoassay kit–based reagents.

We analyzed 977 T 1 -weighted MRI scans using a modified version of the FreeSurfer software package ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ). These analysis procedures have been applied, validated, and described in detail in a number of publications. 18 The MRI scans were reviewed for quality, automatically corrected for spatial distortion due to gradient nonlinearity, registered and averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio. The cortical surface was automatically reconstructed and gray matter thickness measurements were obtained at each point across the cortical mantle. Here, we primarily focused on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, two medial temporal lobe regions that are affected in the earliest stages of AD 19 ( Figure 1 ). We additionally evaluated the amygdala and middle temporal gyrus, two temporal lobe regions that are also affected in AD. 19 The entorhinal cortex and middle temporal gyrus were delineated using an automated, surface-based cortical parcellation atlas. 20 The hippocampus and amygdala were identified using an automated, subcortical segmentation atlas. 21 For the analysis of the longitudinal gray matter volume change, we used Quarc (quantitative anatomical regional change), a recently developed method from our laboratory. 22 , 23 Briefly, each participant's follow-up image was affine-aligned to the baseline scan and locally intensity-normalized. Using nonlinear registration, a deformation field was then calculated to locally register the images with high fidelity for both large- and small-scale structures, including those with low boundary contrast. From the deformation field, a volume-change field (atrophy) can directly be calculated. Using the baseline subcortical and cortical ROIs, the volume-chang field can be sampled at points across the cortical surface or averaged over subcortical regions to give the percent volume change for those ROIs ( Figure 1 ).

We asked whether statistical interactions between CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 and between CSF clusterin and CSF p-tau 181p are associated with brain atrophy over time ( Figure 2 ). Using a linear mixed effects model, we concurrently examined the main and interactive effects of CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 , and CSF p-tau 181p on atrophy rate of the temporal lobe regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and middle temporal gyrus), co-varying for age, sex, carrier status for the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4), group status (MCI vs. HC), and disease severity (assessed using CDR-Sum of Boxes, a composite measure that characterizes six domains of cognitive and functional performance 24 ). Of note, the main effects of all variables (the three CSF analytes and all covariates) were also included in these analyses. For brevity, we focus below on the effects of interest. Specifically:

where Δv = entorhinal cortex or hippocampal atrophy (millimeters 3 ) and Δt = change in time from baseline MRI scan (years). Intercept and slope (β 0 andβ 1 ) were entered as mixed effects.

Prior findings from our laboratory indicate that Aβ-associated neurodegeneration occurs in the presence of elevated p-tau. 11 - 13 To test whether the effect of clusterin on Aβ-associated neurodegeneration is independent from the effect of p-tau on Aβ-associated neurodegeneration, we performed secondary analyses and fit the following linear mixed effects model:

where Δv = entorhinal cortex or hippocampal atrophy (millimeters 3 ) and Δt = change in time from baseline MRI scan (years). Intercept and slope (β 0 andβ 1 ) were entered as mixed effects. We co-varied for age, sex, APOE ε4 carrier status, group status (MCI vs. HC), and CDR-Sum of Boxes. The main effects of all variables (the three CSF analytes and all covariates) were also included in these analyses.

To evaluate whether the above described effects of interest between CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and CSF p-tau 181p status were different between the MCI and HC cohorts, we performed additional analyses fitting group status (MCI vs HC) as an interaction with change in time from baseline MRI scan (Δt or time) and the main interactive effects. The main effects of all variables (the three CSF analytes and all covariates) were also included in these analyses.

## Results
Results from the primary analyses revealed a significant three-way interaction between CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status and time (β 5 = -0.032, standard error (SE) = 0.01, p = 0.01) indicating that increased CSF clusterin and positive CSF Aβ 1-42 status were associated with an elevated entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. In contrast, the interaction between CSF clusterin, CSF p-tau 181p status and time was not significant (β 6 = 0.01, SE = 0.01, p = 0.54). With both of these three-way interaction terms in the model, only the effect of CSF Aβ 1-42 status by time was significantly associated with entorhinal atrophy cortex rate (β 3 = 0.04, SE = 0.02, p = 0.02); the effect of time by CSF clusterin and CSF p-tau 181p status was not associated with entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. None of the main effects of CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status and CSF p-tau 181p status were significant.

Follow-up analyses examining the three way interactions demonstrated that the CSF clusterin by time interaction was significantly associated with entorhinal cortex atrophy only among CSF Aβ 1-42 positive individuals (β-coefficient = -0.20, SE = 0.007, p = 0.008) but not among CSF Aβ 1-42 negative individuals (β-coefficient = 0.007, SE = 0.008, p = 0.36) ( Figure 3a ). In contrast, there was no significant CSF cluster in by time interaction on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate either among CSF p-tau 181p positive (β-coefficient = -0.01, SE = 0.01, p = 0.28) or among CSF p-tau 181p negative individuals (β-coefficient = 0.005, SE = 0.007, p = 0.49) ( Figure 3b ). Similar results were obtained when CSF p-tau 181p and CSF Aβ 1-42 were treated as continuous rather than categorical variables (see Supplemental Results ).

To determine whether these effects differed by group status (MCI vs HC), we performed additional analyses fitting interactions between group status and the main effects of interest (for additional details see Subjects and Methods). These analyses showed a significant interaction between group status, time, CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 status on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate (β-coefficient = -0.031, SE = 0.009, p-value = 0.001). Follow-up subgroup analyses revealed that although both the MCI and HC cohorts demonstrated a significant three-way interaction of time, CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 status on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, whereby entorhinal cortex volume loss was significantly associated with CSF clusterin only among CSF Aβ 1-42 positive individuals, the slopes of change over time were steeper among the MCI cohort than the HC cohort (MCI: β-coefficient = -0.076, SE = 0.03, p = 0.008; HC: β-coefficient = -0.047, SE = 0.01, p = 0.001). The interaction between group status, time, CSF clusterin and CSF p-tau 181p status was not significant. Similar results were obtained when CSF p-tau 181p and CSF Aβ 1-42 were treated as continuous rather than categorical variables (see Supplemental Results ).

To determine whether similar associations could be observed in other temporal lobe areas affected later in the disease process, we repeated these analyses using atrophy rates of the hippocampus, amygdala, and middle temporal gyrus. Results revealed no significant interactions of CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and time on atrophy rate of the hippocampus (β-coefficient = -0.013, SE = 0.01, p = 0.33), amygdala (β-coefficient = -0.015, SE = 0.01, p = 0.24) and middle temporal gyrus (β-coefficient = -0.009, SE = 0.01, p = 0.39). As observed for entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, the interaction of CSF clusterin, CSF p-tau 181p status and time was not significant for atrophy rate of the hippocampus (β-coefficient = 0.004, SE = 0.01, p = 0.74), amygdala (β-coefficient = 0.005, SE = 0.01, p = 0.74) and middle temporal gyrus (β-coefficient = 0.016, SE = 0.01, p = 0.18).

To determine whether the effect of clusterin on Aβ-associated neurodegeneration is independent from the previously observed effect of p-tau on Aβ-associated neurodegeneration, 11 - 13 we included interaction terms with CSF p-tau 181p status (for additional details see Subjects and Methods and Equation 2 ). These analyses on the full cohort revealed significant interactions between CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and time (β-coefficient = -0.026, SE = 0.01, p = 0.01) and CSF p-tau 181p status, CSF Aβ 1-42 status and time (β-coefficient = -0.010, SE = 0.004, p = 0.01) on entorhinal cortex atrophy indicating independent effects of CSF clusterin and CSF p-tau 181p on CSF Aβ 1-42 associated volume loss. As in the primary analyses, with the interaction terms in the model, only the effect of CSF Aβ 1-42 status by time was significant (β-coefficient = 0.04, SE = 0.01, p = 0.009); the effects of time by CSF clusterin and CSF p-tau 181p status were not significant. The main effects of CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status or CSF p-tau 181p status were not significant.

Additional interaction analyses with group status demonstrated significant interactions between group status, time, CSF clusterin and CSF Aβ 1-42 status (β-coefficient = -0.020, SE = 0.003, p-value = 0.01) and between group status, time, CSF p-tau 181p status and CSF Aβ 1-42 status (β-coefficient = -0.008, SE = 0.003, p-value = 0.009) on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. Subgroup analyses showed that within the MCI cohort, interactions between both CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and time (β-coefficient = -0.047, SE = 0.02, p = 0.01) and CSF p-tau 181p status, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and time (β-coefficient = -0.014, SE = 0.007, p = 0.048) on entorhinal cortex atrophy were significant. Within the HC cohort, only the interaction between CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 status, and time on entorhinal cortex atrophy was significant (β-coefficient = -0.032, SE = 0.01, p = 0.02); the interaction between CSF p-tau 181p status, CSF Aβ 1-42 status and time on entorhinal cortex atrophy was not significant (β-coefficient = -0.005, SE = 0.004, p = 0.23).

## Comment
Here, we show that in non-demented older individuals, Aβ-associated entorhinal cortex atrophy occurs in the presence of elevated clusterin. We also found that the effect of clusterin on Aβ-associated entorhinal cortex atrophy is not confounded or explained by p-tau. Taken together, this implicates a potentially important role for clusterin in the earliest stages of the Alzheimer's neurodegenerative process and suggests independent effects of clusterin and p-tau on Aβ-associated volume loss ( Figure 4 ).

Though a number of studies have evaluated the relationship between Aβ, tau and p-tau on volume loss in the earliest stages of AD, 11 - 15 the role of clusterin in modulating this relationship is still unknown. Our findings demonstrate that non-demented older individuals with elevated CSF clusterin and decreased Aβ (i.e. increased intracranial Aβ deposition) experience increased volume loss suggesting that clusterin may accelerate progression from amyloid deposition to neurodegeneration. These results also indicate that a biomarker profile incorporating CSF clusterin, CSF Aβ 1-42 and CSF p-tau 181p levels may better identify those older individuals who are at an elevated risk of progressing to dementia than any of these biomarkers by themselves.

These findings provide novel insights into the preclinical stage of AD. Though prior research suggests that clusterin by itself may not represent a marker of presymptomatic AD, 6 our work indicates that the presence of clusterin may represent a critical link between Aβ deposition and entorhinal cortex degeneration in preclinical AD. Furthermore, in secondary analyses among HC participants, we found a significant interaction on volume loss only between clusterin and Aβ whereas among MCI individuals we noted concurrent interactions of Aβ with both clusterin and p-tau suggesting that the clusterin related effects on Aβ-associated neurodegeneration may precede tau related effects. Finally, in contrast to p-tau-related atrophy within the later-affected hippocampus or other temporal lobe regions, we found clusterin-associated effects only for the entorhinal cortex, a region selectively affected in the earliest stages of AD. 19 Considered together, these findings indicate that the interaction between clusterin and Aβmay provide an important window into the earliest stages of the Alzheimer's neurodegenerative process.

Cellular and molecular evidence suggests that an interaction between clusterin and Aβ potentiates neurotoxicity. Though prior experimental 25 and plasma-based human studies suggest that elevated clusterin levels may represent a non-etiopathological, neuroprotective response, 6 , 26 the molecular mechanism by which clusterin effects AD pathology is still not well understood. Recent experimental evidence indicates that knockdown of clusterin protects against Aβ-induced apoptosis whereas neuronal treatment with Aβ increases intracellular clusterin (and decreases extracellular clusterin), resulting in wnt/Dickkopf-1-induced neurotoxicity. 27 Importantly, this clusterin-dependent, wnt/Dickkopf-1-induced apoptotic effect is specific to Aβ and is not observed with tau or other cytotoxic agents. 27 As a chaperone, clusterin has also been shown to bind with Aβ, thus increasing the rate of fibrillar amyloid deposition and neuritic dystrophy 28 and potentiating Aβ oligomeric neurotoxicity. 29 Consistent with these experimental results, our human findings suggest that clusterin may affect AD neurodegeneration primarily via Aβ-associated mechanisms.

A limitation of our study is its observational nature, which precludes conclusions regarding causation. Our results cannot differentiate whether elevated clusterin causes, results from, or is simply correlated with amyloid deposition and entorhinal cortex atrophy. Additionally, our findings require further validation on a larger, independent population-based cohort.

From a translational perspective, though considerable efforts have focused on Aβ and tau, comparatively little is known about other proteins influencing Alzheimer's neurodegeneration. Our findings implicate the involvement of clusterin in the earliest stages of AD. Using experimental models, it will be essential to better delineate the differential mechanistic aspects of intracellular from extracellular clusterin. In humans, it would be helpful to understand whether CSF and plasma clusterin levels correspond to experimentally derived intracellular or extracellular clusterin. It will also be important to determine whether interactions between clusterin and other factors modulate Aβ-associated neurotoxicity. Along with our current findings, the results from these studies could provide valuable insights into whether modifying clusterin levels or blocking clusterin/Aβ interactions are likely to represent viable therapeutic approaches for individuals in the earliest phases of the disease process.
