# Title
MSFD2A is critical for the formation and function of the blood brain barrier

# Abstract
The central nervous system (CNS) requires a tightly controlled environment free of toxins and pathogens to provide the proper chemical composition for neural function. This environment is maintained by the ‘blood brain barrier’ (BBB), which is composed of blood vessels whose endothelial cells display specialized tight junctions and extremely low rates of transcellular vesicular transport (transcytosis) 1 – 3 . In concert with pericytes and astrocytes, this unique brain endothelial physiological barrier seals the CNS and controls substance influx and efflux 4 – 6 . While BBB breakdown has recently been associated with initiation and perpetuation of various neurological disorders, an intact BBB is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the CNS 7 – 10 . A limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control BBB formation has hindered our ability to manipulate the BBB in disease and therapy. Here, we identify mechanisms governing the establishment of a functional BBB. First, using a novel embryonic tracer injection method, we demonstrate spatiotemporal developmental profiles of BBB functionality and find that the mouse BBB becomes functional at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). We then screen for BBB-specific genes expressed during BBB formation, and find that major facilitator super family domain containing 2a ( Mfsd2a ) is selectively expressed in BBB-containing blood vessels in the CNS. Genetic ablation of Mfsd2a results in a leaky BBB from embryonic periods through adulthood, while maintaining the normal patterning of vascular networks. Electron microscopy examination reveals a dramatic increase in CNS endothelial cell vesicular transcytosis in Mfsd2a −/− mice, without obvious tight junction defects. Finally we show that MFSD2A endothelial expression is regulated by pericytes to facilitate BBB integrity. These findings identify MFSD2A as a key regulator of BBB function that may act by suppressing transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells. Further our findings may aid in efforts to develop therapeutic approaches for CNS drug delivery.

## Methods summary

Homozygous Tie2-GFP transgenic mice (Jackson laboratory, strain 003658) were used for BBB transcriptional profiling. Mfsd2a null mice 21 (MMRRC strain 032467-UCD) were maintained on C57Bl/6;129SVE mixed background and used for testing the involvement of MSFD2A in barrier-genesis. All animals were treated according to institutional and NIH guidelines approved by IACUC at Harvard Medical School.Deeply anaesthetized pregnant mice were used. Minimal volume of 10-kDa Dextran-Tetramethylrhodamine, Lysine Fixable (D3312 Invitrogen) was injected into the embryonic liver, while keeping the embryo connected to the maternal blood circulation through the umbilical cord. After three minutes of tracer circulation, embryonic heads were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and frozen in TissueTek OCT (Sakura). 12 µm sections were then collected and post fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature (RT) for 15 min, washed in PBS and co-stained with either α-PECAM antibody or with Isolectin B4 to visualize blood vessels (see Method section for details). P90 HRP injection and E17.5 cortex capillaries TEM imaging was done as previously described 2 .

## Methods
Wild-type Swiss-Webster mice (Taconic Farms, Inc.) were used for embryonic BBB functionality assays and expression profiles. Homozygous Tie2-GFP transgenic mice (Jackson laboratory, strain 003658) were used for BBB transcriptional profiling. Mfsd2a null mice 23 (Mouse Biology Program, University of California, Davis - MMRRC strain 032467-UCD, B6;129S5-Mfsd2atm1Lex/Mmucd) were maintained on C57Bl/6;129SVE mixed background and used for testing the involvement of MSFD2A in barrier-genesis. Mfsd2a null mutant mice were genotyped using the following PCR primers: 5’ CCTGGTTTGCTAAGTGCTAGC and 5’ GTTCACTGGCTTGGAGGATGC – which provide a 210 bp product for the Mfsd2a wild-type allele. 5’ CACTTCCTAAAGCCTTACTTC and 5’ GCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC – which provide a 301 bp product for the Mfsd2a knockout allele. Pregnant mice were obtained following overnight mating (day of vaginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0.5). All animals were treated according to institutional and NIH guidelines approved by IACUC at Harvard Medical School. Deeply anaesthetized pregnant mice were used.

Tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C overnight, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and frozen in TissueTek OCT (Sakura). Tissue sections were blocked with 5% goat serum, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with the following primary antibodies: α-PECAM (1:500; 553370, BD PharmingenTM), α-Claudin5 (1:400; 35-2500, Invitrogen), α-MFSD2A (1:500; Cell Signaling Technologies (under development)), α-PDGFRβ (1:100; 141402, eBioscience), α-CD31 (1:100; 558744, BD PharmingenTM), α-SMA (1:100, C6198, Sigma Aldrich), followed by 568/488 Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300-1:1000, Invitrogen) or with Isolectin B4 (1:500; I21411, Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted in Fluoromount G (EMS) and visualized by epifluorescence, light, or confocal microscopy.

Tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in TissueTek OCT (Sakura). Sections (18 µm) were hybridized with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled mouse Mfsd2a antisense riboprobe (1,524–2,024bp NM_029662) at 60°C overnight. A sense probe was used to ensure signal specificity. For detection, signals were developed using anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche). After antibody treatment, sections were incubated with BM Purple AP Substrate (Roche).

The method is based on the well-established adult BBB dye injection assay with special considerations for the injection site and volume to cater the nature of embryonic vasculature 20 , 28 – 30 . Four major modifications were made: Embryos were injected while still attached via the umbilical cord to the mother’s blood circulation, minimizing abrupt changes in blood flow. Taking advantage of the sinusoidal/fenestrated and most permeable liver vasculature, dye was injected using a Hamilton syringe into the embryonic liver and was taken into the circulation in a matter of seconds. Dye volume was adjusted to a minimum that still allows detection in all CNS capillaries after 3 minutes of circulation (high fluoresce intensity dye enables the use of small volumes and facilitates detection at the single capillary level – 10-kDa Dextran-Tetramethylrhodamine, lysine Fixable (4 mg/ml D3312 Invitrogen, 1 µl for E13.5, 2 µl for E14.5, 5 µl for E15.5). Traditional perfusion fixation was omitted, again to prevent damage to capillaries. Instead, fixable dyes were used to allow reliable immobilization of the dye at the end of the circulation time (relatively small embryonic brain facilitates immersion fixation). Embryonic heads were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and frozen in TissueTek OCT (Sakura). 12 µm sections were then collected and post fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature (RT) for 15 min, washed in PBS and co-stained with either α-PECAM antibody or with Isolectin B4 to visualize blood vessels. All embryos from each litter were injected blindly prior to genotyping.

P2-P5 pups were deeply anaesthetized and three methods were used: 10 µl of 10-kDa/70-kDa Dextran-Tetramethylrhodamine (4 mg/ml D3312 Invitrogen) was injected into the left ventricle with a Hamilton syringe. After 5 min of circulation, brains were dissected and fixed by immersion in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and frozen in TissueTek OCT (Sakura). 12 µm sections were collected and post fixed in 4% PFA at RT for 15 min, washed in PBS and co-stained to visualize blood vessels with either α-PECAM primary antibody (1:500; 553370, BD Pharmingen™), followed by 488-Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) or with Isolectin B4 (1:500; I21411, Molecular Probes). 10 µl of HRP Type II (5 mg/ml P8250-50KU Sigma-Aldrich) were injected into the left heart ventricle with a Hamilton syringe. After 5 min of circulation brains were dissected and immersion fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 4% PFA in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.3) at RT for 1 hour then at 4°C for 3 hours then washed in cacodylate buffer overnight. 100 µm cortical vibratome sections were processed in a standard DAB reaction. EZ-link sulfo NHS Biotin was used as a tracer as described before 17 .

Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-2 digital camera was used to image HRP tracer experiments, vasculature density and pericyte coverage comparisons and expression analyses. Zeiss LSM 510 META upright confocal microscope was used to image Dextran and NHS-Sulfo-biotin BBB permeability assays. Nikon FluoView™ FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope and Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope were used for imaging MFSD2A and pericyte marker immunohistochemistry. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and ImageJ (NIH).

25 µm-thick coronal sections of E15.5, P4 and P70 brains were immunostained for PECAM. For vascular density and branching, confocal images were acquired with a Nikon FluoView™ FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope and maximal projection images (5 per animal) were used for quantifications. The number of branching points was manually counted. Capillary density was quantified using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) by measuring the area occupied by PECAM-positive vessels per cortical area. The mean capillary diameter was measured manually in ImageJ from cross-sectional vascular profiles (20 per animal) on micrographs (5–7 per animal) taken under a 60x objective with a 2x digital zoom.

For artery distribution quantification, 25 µm-thick sections (P60) were stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and PECAM. The proportion of PECAM-positive brain vessels with artery (SMA) identity was quantified using MetaMorph and expressed as percent of controls. Quantification was done blindly.

Pericyte coverage of cortex vessels in Mfsd2a −/− and wild-type littermates control mice was quantified by analyzing the proportion of total Claudin5-positive endothelial length also positive for the pericyte markers CD13- or PDGFR-β. Immunostaining was performed on 20µm sections of P5 cortex. In each animal 20 images of 10 different sections were analyzed.

Microvasculature was found to be completely covered by pericytes in both control and Mfsd2a −/− mice and therefore no error bars are presented for the average pericyte coverage in Fig. S9 a-b . (n = 3). All the Analysis was done with ImageJ (NIH). Quantification was done blindly.

Epi-fluorescence images of sections from injected tracer and co-stained with lectin were manually analyzed with ImageJ (NIH). 12 µm coronal cortical sections of the same rostral-caudal position were used for the analysis. The same acquisition parameters were applied to all images and same threshold was used. Tracer positive cells found outside a vessel (parenchyma) were used as a parameter for leakage. For each embryo, at least 20 sections of a fixed lateral cortical plate area were scored. Four arbitrary leakage groups were classified based on the number of tracer parenchyma positive cells per section (0, 1–5, 5–10, and 10–40). Average representation of each leakage group was calculated for Mfsd2a −/− and control embryos. Quantification was done blindly.

Spectrophotometric quantification of 10-kDa fluoro-ruby-dextran tracer was done from cortical extracts, 16hr after tail vein injections in adult mice, as described before 5 .

TEM imaging of P90 HRP injection and E17.5 cortex capillaries was done as previously described 2 . 10 mg (per 20 g) of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Aldrich, HRP , type II) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of PBS and injected into the tail veins of deeply anaesthetized P90 mice. After 30 min of HRP circulation, brains were dissected and fixed by immersion in a 0.1M sodium cacodylate- buffered mixture (5% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) followed by 5 hr in PFA at 4°C. Following fixation, the tissue was washed overnight in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and then cut in 50 µm-thick free floating sections using a vibrotome. Sections were incubated for 45 min at RT in 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, containing 5.0 mg/10 ml of 3–3' diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma Aldrich) with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5 % potassium ferrocyanide and dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. E17.5 samples were processed as the P90 samples without HRP injection and with longer fixation times (2–3 days in room temperature). Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were then cut from the block surface, collected on copper grids, stained with Reynold’s lead citrate and examined under a 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL) equipped with a 2k CCD digital camera (AMT).

Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused through the heart with 30ml of PBS followed by 150 ml of a fixative solution (0.5% glutaraldehyde in 4% PFA prepared in 0.1 mM phosphate buffer, PB, pH 7.4), and then by 100 ml of 4% PFA in PB. The brain was removed and post fixed in 4% PFA (30 min, 4°C) and washed in PBS. 50 µm-thick coronal brain sections were cut the same day with a vibratome and processed free-floating. Sections were immersed in 0.1% sodium borohydride in PBS (20 min, RT), rinsed in PBS, and preincubated (2 hr) in a blocking solution of PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.5% gelatine and 0.01% Triton. Incubation (24 hr, RT) with rabbit anti-MFSD2A (1:100; Cell Signaling Technologies (under development)) primary antibody was followed by rinses in PBS and incubation (overnight, RT) in a dilution of gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgGs (1:50; 2004, Nanoprobes). After washes in PBS and sodium acetate, the size of immunogold particles was silver-enhanced and sections rinsed in PB before processing for electron microscopy.

Comparison between wild-type and Mfsd2a −/− pericyte coverage and spectrophotometric quantification of 10-kDa fluoro-ruby-dextran tracer leakage was performed by a Mann–Whitney U test (appropriate for small sample size - each embryo was considered as a sample). An unpaired student’s t -test was used (GraphPad Prism 4 Software) for comparison between wild-type and Mfsd2a −/− for vascular density, artery distribution, number of vesicular types, mean capillary diameter and MFSD2A expression in pericyte deficient mice. P < 0.05 was considered significant (StatXact (Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA).

E13.5 Tie2-GFP embryos were micro-dissected for cortex and lungs. Cortex tissue was carefully cleared of the meninges and choroid plexus. FACS purification of GFP positive cells and GeneChip analysis was performed as previously described 31 . RNA was purified with Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Applied biosystems™), followed by NuGEN Ovation V2 standard linear amplification and hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. All material from a single litter (10–13 embryos) was pooled and considered as a biological replicate. Four biological replicates were used. Each biological replicate represents purification from different litters performed on different days.

Expression data from pericyte deficient mice generated by Armulik et al. 5 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo , GSE15892). All microarrays were analyzed using MAS5 probe set condensation algorithm with Expression Console software (Affymetrix). P-value was determined using a two tailed student’s t -test (n = 4).

Brain samples from P10-P14 mice and controls were kindly provided by Dr. Christer Betsholtz. Samples processing and immunohistochemistry was done as described for all other samples in our study. MFSD2A staining quantification was done with 12 µm cortical sagital sections. Confocal images were acquired with Nikon FluoView™ FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Quantification of mean gray value per vascular profile was done with ImageJ (NIH) by outlining vascular profiles according to lectin staining and measuring MFSD2A intensity in these areas. In all images, PDGFRβ antibody staining was used to test presence of pericytes in quantified vessels. n = 2 animals per genotype, 60 images quantified of at least 600 vascular profiles per animal. Quantification was done blindly.
