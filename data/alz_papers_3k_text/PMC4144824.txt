Resistance Mechanisms for the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib

# Abstract
Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell–receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell–receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

## METHODS
We obtained blood samples from patients enrolled in institutional review board–approved trials of ibrutinib. One of the patients (Patient 1) is described extensively in the Journal by Furman et al. 16 Tumor DNA was isolated from blood mononuclear cells with the use of the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Sample preparation and whole-exome sequencing with the use of Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V4 and Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology were performed by Expression Analysis.

The exome-sequencing analysis pipeline is shown in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org . Sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (1000 Genomes Project human assembly GRCh37) with the use of Burrows– Wheeler Aligner, version 0.7.5. 17 After potential polymerase-chain-reaction or optical duplicates had been marked with the use of Picard, version 1.94 ( http://picard.sourceforge.net ), local realignment around indels was performed by means of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), version 2.8.1, 18 and relapse-specific single point mutations and indels were detected with the use of MuTect, version 1.1.4, 19 and GATK Somatic Indel Detector, respectively. Variants previously reported in the dbSNP database, build 137, were filtered out, and the remaining variants were annotated and their potential mutational effects predicted with the use of SnpEff, version 3.4. 20 Finally, newly acquired, relapse-specific, nonsynonymous mutations with high-quality reads were verified by means of Sanger or Ion Torrent sequencing.

DNA was extracted from cryopreserved cells with the use of the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). BTK and PLCγ2 were analyzed with the use of the Ion Torrent platform from Life Technologies. Details of sample preparation, library generation, and sequence analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .

The PiggyBac Transposon Vector System (System Biosciences) was used to generate DNA constructs of BTK with both green-fluorescent-protein and puromycin selection markers, and protein expression was controlled with the use of chicken β-actin promoter. See the Supplementary Appendix for details.

Full-length His6- and Strep-tagged BTK and BTK C481S were expressed in mammalian HEK-EBNA cells and purified by means of affinity chromatography. Purified proteins (100 ng per milliliter) were used in a LANCE Ultra kinase assay (PerkinElmer), with 100 nM ULight-poly GT (PerkinElmer) as a substrate and 200 µM ATP. Compounds were preincubated at room temperature with enzyme before the kinase reaction. After 45 minutes of kinase reaction, excess EDTA was added, and a europium-labeled anti–poly-GT antibody was incubated before signal measurement in a dual-laser EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer), set at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 615 to 665 nm.

HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression constructs, treated with ibrutinib for 1 hour, and fixed with paraformaldehyde or washed into fresh media and then fixed. Cells were permeabilized, stained, and analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II analyzer (BD Biosciences).

For immunoblot assays, whole-cell lysates were prepared and equivalent amounts of protein were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After antibody incubation, proteins were detected with the use of a chemiluminescent substrate (Super-Signal, Pierce). Details on the antibodies used are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .

The statistical methods for individual experiments are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix .

## RESULTS
Peripheral-blood samples were available at baseline and at the time of relapse from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib manifested by progressive CLL. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on each sample. Clinical characteristics and new mutations identified at the time of relapse in the patients with matched samples are shown in Table 1 , and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix . Alignment statistics are shown in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix . Copynumber analysis was performed to ensure that identified variants were not a result of potential copy-number alterations ( Table 3 and Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix ). All patients had highrisk cytogenetic features, such as del(11q22.3), del(17p13.1), or a complex karyotype.

In Patients 1 through 5, sequencing of the relapse sample revealed a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at position 481 (C481S) ( Fig. 3A in the Supplementary Appendix ). In Patient 6, the relapse sample had an arginine-to-tryptophan mutation in PLCγ2 at position 665 (R665W) ( Fig. 3B in the Supplementary Appendix ). One patient with a low-frequency C481S mutation in BTK also had three distinct PLCγ2 mutations: the R665W mutation, a leucine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 845 (L845F) ( Fig. 3C in the Supplementary Appendix ), and a serine-to-tyrosine mutation at position 707 that was previously reported as an activating mutation in a dominantly inherited inflammatory disease. 21 In this patient, BTK C481S and PLCγ2 L845F were identified by means of whole-exome sequencing, and the other mutations were identified by means of Ion Torrent sequencing. To verify these clones, Ion Torrent sequencing was performed again on samples obtained 1 month after relapse, and all previously identified mutations were still present ( Table 4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Mutations identified by whole-exome sequencing were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, Ion Torrent deep sequencing, or both.

At baseline, no patient had evidence of mutations in either BTK or PLCγ2 on the basis of whole-exome sequencing. In Patients 3, 5, and 6, Ion Torrent sequencing was performed, and no mutation was identified in more than 0.2% of reads ( Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). At relapse, none of the patients had mutations in other kinases containing a cysteine residue homologous to C481 in BTK that are irreversibly inhibited by ibrutinib (data on ITK, BMX, TEC, EGFR, JAK3, HER2, HER4, and BLK not shown). 7 , 22 No other recurrent mutation was noted in any of these six patients at the time of relapse.

We performed functional characterization of non-mutant BTK and BTK with the C481S mutation. The intrinsic affinity of ibrutinib for nonmutant BTK was significantly higher than for mutant BTK (dissociation constant, 0.2 nM vs. 10.4 nM) ( Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Although both nonmutant and mutant BTK were inhibited by ibrutinib, the half-maximal effective concentration for BTK with the C481S mutation was significantly higher than for nonmutant BTK ( Fig. 1A ). In a cellular model, ibrutinib was significantly less effective at blocking BTK autophosphorylation ( Fig. 1B ) and downstream signaling (as indicated by phosphorylated ERK levels) in cells with mutant BTK than in cells with nonmutant BTK ( Fig. 4A in the Supplementary Appendix ), whereas dasatinib, a reversible inhibitor of BTK, 23 inhibited nonmutant and mutant BTK with similar efficacy. Ibrutinib washout experiments showed that the C481S mutation allows reversible, but not irreversible, inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib, which was confirmed by kinase-binding assays ( Fig. 4B and Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix ).

Next, we compared the function of nonmutant BTK and BTK with the C481S mutation by stably transfecting constructs into DT40 (BTK −/− ) chicken B cells. After activation of the B-cell receptor, signaling downstream of BTK was inhibited by ibrutinib, as shown by decreased downstream signaling (phosphorylation of PLCγ2, ERK, and AKT) and calcium flux; this inhibition was diminished in mutant BTK as compared with nonmutant BTK ( Fig. 1C , and Fig. 5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). These data clearly show that the C481S mutation in BTK confers relative resistance to ibrutinib by preventing irreversible binding, providing confirmation that this is a functionally relevant resistance mutation.

We compared BTK phosphorylation on exposure to ibrutinib in cells obtained at baseline and at the time of relapse from one of the patients in whom a BTK C481S mutation developed. At baseline, BTK phosphorylation was completely abrogated by ibrutinib with either washout or continuous exposure to ibrutinib. At the time of relapse, however, ibrutinib inhibited BTK phosphorylation only with continuous exposure, a finding that shows that the drug binds the mutant reversibly in patients ( Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Appendix ).

It has been shown that the S707Y mutation in PLCγ2 has a gain-of-function effect owing to disruption of an autoinhibitory SH2 domain. 21 We therefore chose to focus on functional characterization of the R665W and L845F mutations. We stably transfected nonmutated PLCγ2 , PLCγ2 with the L845F mutation, or PLCγ2 with the R665W mutation into HEK 293T cells and DT40 cells, which lack endogenous PLCγ2 expression ( Fig. 7A in the Supplementary Appendix ). We examined calcium flux in DT40 cells after stimulation with anti-IgM antibody in the presence of nonmutant or mutant PLCγ2. In contrast to BTK with the C481S mutation, for which calcium flux was very modestly inhibited by ibrutinib, PLCγ2 with either the R665W mutation or the L845F mutation showed enhanced IgM antibody–mediated calcium flux that was not inhibited by ibrutinib ( Fig. 2 ). Thus, these mutations allow for B-cell receptor–mediated signaling that is independent of BTK. Similarly, after stimulation with anti-IgM antibody, cells with either the R665W mutation or the L845F mutation in PLCγ2 showed less inhibition in the presence of ibrutinib than nonmutant cells, as measured by phosphorylation of ERK and AKT ( Fig. 7B in the Supplementary Appendix ). These data show that the R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are potentially gain-of-function mutations in the presence of B-cell–receptor stimulation and could be relevant as mutations conferring resistance to ibrutinib in patients.

Finally, we examined CLL cells obtained at baseline and at the time of relapse from Patients 5 and 6. In Patient 6, the decrease in BTK phosphorylation at the time of the relapse was similar to the decrease at 11 months of therapy, when the patient was having a response to the drug ( Fig. 3A ), whereas PLCγ2 showed enhanced phosphorylation at the time of relapse ( Fig. 3B ). After ibrutinib was discontinued, ibrutinib still inhibited BTK phosphorylation ( Fig. 3C ) but not PLCγ2 phosphorylation ( Fig. 3D ). In Patient 5, who had mutations in both BTK and PLCγ2, in vitro ibrutinib did not inhibit either BTK or PLCγ2 phosphorylation ( Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Appendix ). These data suggest that the gain-of-function phenotype seen in vitro is also relevant in patients.

In patients treated with ibrutinib, a characteristic lymphocytosis develops as CLL cells are mobilized from lymph nodes and the spleen. Although lymphocytosis typically resolves within 8 months, a subgroup of patients have lymphocytosis that lasts longer than 12 months in the presence of a continued response to ibrutinib. 24 To determine whether such patients have new mutations in BTK or PLCγ2 and may therefore be at risk for relapse, we sequenced these two genes using Ion Torrent technology in nine patients who had lymphocytosis for at least 12 months after the initiation of ibrutinib therapy. The sequencing depth for BTK at C481 and for PLCγ2 at R665 and S707 was more than 700 reads, and the sequencing depth for PLCγ2 at L845 was more than 100 reads. No patient had evidence of any mutation in BTK or PLCγ2 (data not shown). These observations suggest that persistent lymphocytosis is not associated with known resistance mutations.

## DISCUSSION
Acquired resistance to ibrutinib is due at least in part to recurrent mutations in BTK and PLCγ2 . Our functional studies suggest that the C481S mutation in BTK confers resistance to ibrutinib by preventing irreversible drug binding. The S707Y, R665W, and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are all potentially gain-of-function mutations that allow B-cell receptor–mediated activation that is independent of BTK. Calcium-flux assays showed enhanced and sustained activation after anti-IgM antibody stimulation, which is probably very relevant in patients in whom CLL cells are exposed to chronic antigen stimulation. None of these mutations were detected before drug exposure. The clinical significance of the very low variant reads on Ion Torrent sequencing for the R665W mutation in PLCγ2 at baseline is unknown, and more patients will need to be evaluated to determine whether this signal is identifying patients at risk for relapse. We also found that patients with persistent lymphocytosis during ibrutinib treatment did not have evidence of these resistance mutations on deep sequencing. We have previously documented by immunoblot analysis 24 that BTK and PLCγ2 are inhibited in these patients, and these data suggest that patients with prolonged lymphocytosis during ibrutinib therapy do not have detectable small clones of resistant cells that would put them at high risk for relapse. However, we recognize that our inability to identify small numbers of mutant clones in the presence of large numbers of nonmutant clones may mean that such variants were present but were not identified.

Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors through mutations that alter drug binding are seen with other targets and other cancers, including BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia, 11 EGFR 25 , 26 and ALK 27 in lung cancer, KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 28 and FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia. 29 , 30 Unlike the mutations in this group, however, the C481S mutation in BTK is not a second mutation in a previously mutated gene, but rather a primary mutation in a gene that is not recurrently mutated in CLL, and it is mutated at the amino acid required for drug binding. This mutation is not known to cause the X-linked agammaglobulinemia phenotype 31 but instead results in retained catalytic activity. Our identification of a previously identified activating PLCγ2 mutation 21 and our functional characterization of the two additional mutations showed that the activation of B-cell–receptor signaling distal to BTK can also confer resistance. This pattern of a mutation localized to the irreversible binding site of ibrutinib and the immediate downstream kinase is not commonly seen with reversible kinase inhibitors and may be a result of continuous (rather than intermittent) pressure on the drug target. As other potent irreversible kinase inhibitors are developed for key signaling pathways in cancer, it will be of interest to determine whether this pattern of resistance is generalized. Studies of the stability of the mutated RNA and proteins are ongoing.

Although acquired resistance to ibrutinib has developed in only a small proportion of patients, these data suggest that patients with increased genomic instability, including those with del(17p13.1), del(11q22.3), or a complex karyotype, may be at risk for relapse. On the basis of available data, patients with del(17p13.1) or a complex karyotype seem to be the most rational choice for combination therapies designed to avoid the development of resistance.

Even though this series of patients had a uniform presence of mutations in BTK, PLCγ2, or both, it is clear that other mechanisms of resistance are also present in a subgroup of patients. In a recent preliminary study involving three patients with ibrutinib resistance, sequencing revealed the S707Y mutation in PLCγ2 that we identified in Patient 5 in our study but did not reveal BTK mutations. 32 In patients without B-cell–receptor pathway mutations, resistance may be mediated through mutations in other coding genes providing alternative survival signals that are not inhibited by ibrutinib or through noncoding RNA, epigenetic activation or silencing, or selective gene amplification. In addition, other mutations may act in combination with the BTK or PLCγ2 mutations to drive resistance, such as the additional driver mutations outlined in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix . Work is ongoing to identify alternative mechanisms of resistance and also to determine the role, if any, of other identified mutations.

Although ibrutinib inhibits other similar kinases that contain C481, including ITK and BLK, 7 , 22 mutations have not been observed in these other targets, findings that suggest that BTK is its critical target. Knowledge of downstream mediators of resistance may lead to the development of rational combinations to prevent or treat resistant disease.
