# Title
Large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies six new risk loci for Parkinson’s disease

# Abstract
We conducted a meta analysis of Parkinson’s disease genome-wide association studies using a common set of 7,893,274 variants across 13,708 cases and 95,282 controls. Twenty-six loci were identified as genome-wide significant; these and six additional previously reported loci were then tested in an independent set of 5,353 cases and 5,551 controls. Of the 32 tested SNPs, 24 replicated, including 6 novel loci. Conditional analyses within loci show four loci including GBA , GAK/DGKQ , SNCA , and HLA contain a secondary independent risk variant. In total we identified and replicated 28 independent risk variants for Parkinson disease across 24 loci. While the effect of each individual locus is small, a risk profile analysis revealed a substantial cummulative risk in a comparison highest versus lowest quintiles of genetic risk (OR=3.31, 95% CI: 2.55, 4.30; p-value = 2×10 −16 ). We also show 6 risk loci associated with proximal gene expression or DNA methylation.

## ONLINE METHODS
All studies willing to participate with genome-wide genotyping data on Parkinson’s diseases cases and controls were included in this effort. For specific details on these studies, please refer to individual publications [IPDGC, PD GWAS Consortium, 23&Me, CHARGE, PDGENE, and Ashkenazi studies]. 2 – 6 , 10 , 17 , 27 – 30 For this analysis, the 23andMe cohort was split into two subsets “v2” and “v3”. The “v2” designation refers to a subset of samples genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550+ BeadChip, the “v3” designation refers to a subset of samples genotyped on the Illumina Human OmniExpress+ BeadChip. Besides different genotyping arrays, sample handling, ascertainment, quality control and analytic methods were identical across the 23andMe subsets. For 3 out of the 15 studies contributing to the discovery phase of analyses, population controls were utilized to some degree, totaling 8,156 samples ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Based on a prevalence of 2 in 1,000, we could estimate a misclassification of approximately 16 samples across datasets. This would likely have a small impact based on our large sample size, meta-analytic design and interest in relatively common allele frequencies.

In general standard quality control was applied by each study for sample inclusion, including case age at onset over 18 years, no known mutations in genes associated with Mendelian forms of PD ( SNCA, PARK2, DJ-1, PINK1, LRRK2 ), minimum sample call rate > 95%, European ancestry confirmed through principal components or multidimensional scaling analyses, no relation to other samples in the meta-analysis (checked when possible by use of dbGAP available data) at the cousin level or closer (except in the case of Framingham Heart Study). Studies deriving samples from the same geographic region (or globally in the case of the 23AndMe dataset) cross-checked for relatedness when data access was permitted by using identity by descent filtering to remove related samples both within and across datasets contributing to the meta-analysis. If samples overlapped studies involved in the meta-analysis, the sample was excluded from the series with less dense genotyping. All participants donated DNA samples and provided informed consent for participation in genetics studies. Prior to imputation, SNPs were filtered using study specific criteria including a minimum call rate of > 95%, a minor allele frequency > 1%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-values > 1×10 −4 in controls and non-random missingness by phenotype or haplotype at p-values > 1×10 −4 . SNPs ambiguous to strand (A/T and G/C) were also removed. Imputation to a standard reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project (August 2010 release, European ancestry only) was then carried out using miniMac on default settings. 31

Imputed dosages were then analyzed using logistic regression for case-control studies or cox regression for cohort studies (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium cohorts with incident cases) adjusting for the first 2 eigenvectors from principal components analysis, age at onset (cases) or exam (controls), and sex. Eigenvectors from principal components for use as covariates were generated on a study specific level, with each dataset applying its own adjustment separately. This was also repeated in the replication by generating unique eigenvectors for each ancestry stratified dataset for use as covariates. The Framingham Heart Study utilized generalized estimating equations clustered on pedigrees to account for family relationships.

Meta-analysis was conducted based on the fixed-effect model as implemented in METAL by combining summary statistics across datasets. 32 At the meta-analytic level, summary statistics were filtered for inclusion after meeting a minimum imputation quality (RSQ from miniMac) of 0.30, minor allele frequency greater than 0.1% across studies, realistic beta coefficients where the absolute value of beta was less than 5, and passing initial quality control in at least three of the contributing studies. In addition, we tested novel random-effects approaches from Han and Eskin, 2011; however, this method did not identify any novel loci and since the results across both methodologies were near identical, thus only fixed-effect results are reported here. 33

Conditional analyses were undertaken using identical statistical models as in the discovery phase except for the inclusion of allele dosages from the most significant SNP per locus as an additional covariate. For each locus identified as genome-wide significant in the discovery phase, we reran cohort level analyses in a subset of 7 datasets with the largest counts of cases (due to primary data availability at the participant level, only IPDGC-NIA, IPDGC-NL, IPDGC-GE, 23&Me, PROGENI-GenePD, NGRC and HIHG were included) testing all SNPs within +/− 1MB from the 26 genome-wide significant SNPs in Table 1 , while adjusting for the SNP with the most extreme p-value per locus. These summary statistics were then meta-analyzed in the same manner as the discovery phase analyses. The threshold for multiple test correction across secondary loci for conditional analyses was set to 1×10 −5 based on Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs tested across all regions. These methods were also applied to look for tertiary signals at all loci; three tertiary loci were identified, but these signals were not included in the replication array and are therefore not shown (data available upon request to corresponding author).

Replication genotyping was carried out using the Illumina NeuroX genotyping array, with all samples genotyped at the National Institute on Aging’s Laboratory of Neurogenetics (LNG). In brief, the NeuroX array includes over 24,000 neurodegenerative-focused-variants added to the existing >240,000 exonic variants already available on Illumina’s Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. Of these neurodegenerative-focused variants, over 9,000 variants are dedicated to Parkinson’s disease and include tagging SNPs, proxies and technical replicates for loci of interest related to the discovery phase of this study. For each genome-wide significant locus identified in the discovery phase of this study and in the conditional analyses, loci were covered on the array by either 5 additional proxy SNPs or 5 technical replicates if no proxy SNPs were available. Loci were defined as any SNP reaching a genome-wide significant p-value and correlated at r 2 < 0.50 with any other significant SNPs within 250 kilobases within each genomic region of interest. Proxies were selected based on this 250kb threshold and LD defined using 1000 genomes European ancestry samples from the same panel in which the discovery series was imputed. Proxies were ranked by discovery phase p-value after meeting the LD threshold minimum of r 2 > 0.50 with the most significant SNP in the locus. Nominated proxies with the smallest discovery phase p-value were given precedence in replication analyses when the most significant SNP from the discovery phase was not available or not successfully assayed on the NeuroX array. For replication, 39 SNPs or their highest ranked proxy in terms of discovery phase or conditional p-value were utilized in the replication analyses. All summary statistics for these replication SNPs will be made available on the PDgene website (PDGene database ( http://www.pdgene.org ). Genotypes were called using Illumina GenomeStudio, and all PD related SNPs analyzed for this study were manually clustered and visually inspected. Standard exome content variants included on the NeuroX array were called using a cluster file from the CHARGE Consortium based on over 60,000 samples and these variants were used for sample quality control. 34 Over 14,000 samples genotyped on the array at LNG were used in the variant calling process.

From called genotypes, PD cases and neurologically normal controls were extracted and underwent quality control as per standard GWAS, with slight deviations from normal practices to account for the bias in NeuroX array content. Variants with GenTrain scores > 0.70 (indicative of quality genotype clusters) from the standard content of the NeuroX array were extracted first to calculate call rates. Samples with call rates < 95% were excluded, as well as samples whose genetically determined sex did not match that from clinical data and samples exhibiting excess heterozygosity. After these initial exclusions, SNPs overlapping with HapMap Phase 3 samples were extracted from the previous subset and pruned for LD (SNPs excluded if r 2 > 0.50 within a 50 SNP sliding window), as well as concurrently excluding SNPs with MAF < 5%, HWE p-values < 1×10 −5 in controls, and per SNP missingness rates > 5%. At this stage, pairwise identity by descent filtering was then used to remove samples that were cryptically related and principal components analysis was used to identify samples that were to be excluded due to genetic ancestry not consistent with primarily European descent based on comparisons with HapMap Phase 3 reference populations. After these exclusions, the samples passing quality control were separated into distinct datasets based on the country and center of origin. All samples in the replication series were ascertained as follows: case ascertainment was based on UK brain bank criteria from clinic visit, or use of PD medication or medical records of PD diagnosis by clinician; recruited controls include individuals free of known neurological disease either by clinical assessment and/or self-report. The final replication set consisted of 5,353 cases and 5,551 controls with all relevant phenotypic data for this analysis stratified across American (2,407 cases and 2,782 controls), French (553 cases, 474 controls), German (1,044 cases and 871 controls), Greek (944 cases and 877 controls) and British (405 cases and 547 controls) participants.

Within each subset of samples passing quality control, principal components analysis was used to generate eigenvectors for use as covariates to account for population substructure within each cohort based on common high quality SNPs that have also been LD pruned as described above. Within each subset of samples, logistic regression adjusting for the first 2 eigenvectors from principal components analysis, age at onset (cases) or exam (controls), and sex was used to examine associations of each nominated SNP with PD. After subset summary statistics were generated, fixed-effect meta-analyses were used to generate aggregate summary statistics and quantify heterogeneity across subsets for all 39 replication target SNPs placed on the array. As a note, regions around these SNPs +/− 500kb were not included in the sample QC procedure, and these 39 SNPs were manually clustered to evaluate quality genotyping.

Risk profiles were generated incorporating three groups of SNPs. The first group included genome-wide significant index SNPs (or their proxies) from the discovery phase that replicated in the independent replication phase (n=22). The second group comprised conditional SNPs that validated in the replication phase (n=4). The third group consisted of previously reported SNPs that did not quite meet genome-wide significance in the discovery phase but provided evidence of association in the replication phase (n=2). These risk profiles were generated using weights based on effect estimates from the discovery phase of this study using methodologies described in detail elsewhere. 3 , 4 , 11 , 35 In brief, genetic risk scores were scaled on a per SNP basis using effect estimates from the discovery phase then applied to the genotype data generated for the samples in the replication phase to create the dataset for analyses of the risk profiles. Within each subset of the replication sample series, overall trend tests for PD risk were evaluated using logistic regression with the risk profile score predicting affection status adjusted for the first 2 eigenvectors from PCA as well as age and sex. Each subset was also divided into quintiles based on their risk profile scores, and similar logistic regression models were used to estimate risk associated in each of the 4 higher risk quintiles compared to the lowest risk quintile. All risk profile summary statistics were meta-analyzed across subsets using random-effects to account for effect heterogeneity. To evaluate clinical predictability of PD, all risk profiles were combined into one model across replication subsets, adjusting for age, sex and cohort/subset membership in receiver-operator curve analyses.

Overlapping SNPs identified in the discovery phase ( Tables 1 and 2 ) that were successfully genotyped or imputed in the combined North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) and United Kingdom Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC) datasets were tested for association with proximal expression and methylation levels (GSE36192). Allelic dosages of SNPs of interest were tested for association with all methylation and expression probes within +/− 1MB from each SNP using linear regression adjusting for covariates of gender, age at death, the first two component vectors from multi-dimensional scaling, post mortem interval (PMI), brain bank and batch in which preparation or hybridization were performed, using MACH2QTLv1.11 ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/download/ ). These analyses were run separately for frontal cortex and cerebellar regions, each with analyses focusing on methylation (292 samples) or expression (399 samples). For these four analyses, significance was based on standard FDR adjustments for multiple testing.

## EXPRESSION AND METHYLATION METHODS
Frozen frontal cortex and cerebellar samples were obtained from > 399 self-reported European ancestry samples without determinable neuropathological evidence of disease. 26 , 36 Genomic DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform. Bisulfite converted DNA and assayed at > 27,000 sites on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChips. MRNA expression levels were assayed using Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 Expression Beadchips. In brief, Individual probes were excluded from analyses if the p-value for detection was > 0.01 or there was less than 95% completeness of data per probe, and samples were excluded if <95% of probes were detected. Probes were also removed if an analyzed SNP was within the probe or the probe mapped ambiguously to multiple locations in the genome. Expression data were cubic spline normalized and log2-transformed prior to analyses.

Each tissue sample was genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 v3, Human610-Quad v1 or Human660W-Quad v1 Infinium Beadchips, shared SNPs were extracted prior to QC and imputation. Standard GWAS quality control was undertaken with inclusion criteria such as: minimum call rate 95% for both participants and SNPs, MAF > 0.01, HWE > 1×10 −7 , no first-degree relatives in the sample collection (identity by descent score < 0.125 in PLINK), and European ancestry confirmed by multidimensional scaling analyses.

Data were imputed using MiniMac ( http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac ) to the most recent data freeze of 1000 Genomes haplotypes ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/download/1000G.2012-03-14.html ) using default settings. All imputed SNPs were filtered for a minimum imputation quality of 0.30. After quality control, data were available for > 10 million SNPs, with expression data on 399 samples (9814 probes from the frontal cortex and 9587 probes in cerebellum) and methylation data on 292 samples (27465 CpG sites in the frontal cortex tissue samples and 27419 CpG sites in the cerebellum).

Linear regression models were utilized to estimate associations between allele dosages of per SNP and gene expression or methylation levels adjusted for covariates of gender, age at death, the first two component vectors from multi-dimensional scaling, post mortem interval (PMI), brain bank and batch in which preparation or hybridization were performed, using MACH2QTLv1.11 ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/download/ ). Analyses were carried out separately for each brain region and each array type. Only probes within +/− 1MB were analyzed to test only cis associations. From these analysis results, data were mined for 28 replciated SNPs of interest included in Table 1 and Table 2 .
