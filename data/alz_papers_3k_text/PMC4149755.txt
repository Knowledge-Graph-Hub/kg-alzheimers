# Title
Axonally synthesized ATF4 transmits a neurodegenerative signal across brain regions

# Abstract
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain exposure of axons to Aβ causes pathogenic changes that spread retrogradely by unknown mechanisms affecting the entire neuron. We found that locally applied Aβ 1–42 initiates axonal synthesis of a defined set of proteins including the transcription factor ATF4. Inhibition of local translation and retrograde transport or knockdown of axonal Atf4 mRNA abolished Aβ-induced ATF4 transcriptional activity and cell loss. Aβ 1–42 injection into the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice caused loss of forebrain neurons whose axons project to the DG. Protein synthesis and Atf4 mRNA were upregulated in these axons, and co-injection of Atf4 siRNA into the DG reduced the effects of Aβ 1–42 in the forebrain. ATF4 protein and transcripts were found with greater frequency in axons in the brain of AD patients. These results reveal an active role for intra-axonal translation in neurodegeneration and identify ATF4 as a mediator for the spread of AD pathology.

## INTRODUCTION
β-amyloid pathology is a central component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Aβ 1–42 is considered causative for most neurodegenerative alterations in AD ( Hardy and Selkoe, 2002 ). Accumulation of soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ 1–42 is positively correlated with the onset of cognitive decline in AD brain, and it elicits neurodegeneration in primary neurons. As axons and dendrites are generally much larger than their cell bodies and project over long distances in the brain, elevated Aβ 1–42 levels will first be sensed by neurites. Consequently, pathogenic signaling mechanisms will initially be triggered within neurites. Several aspects of AD pathogenesis such as tau hyperphosphorylation or impaired transport are first apparent in axons ( Iqbal et al., 2009 ; Perlson et al., 2010 ), and local application of Aβ 1–42 is sufficient to induce neurite degeneration ( Ivins et al., 1998 ) and to interfere with retrograde axonal trafficking ( Poon et al., 2013 ). Indeed, pathogenic changes within axons may be primary events driving the development of the classical pathological changes ( Krstic and Knuesel, 2013 ). For example, in AD brains with amyloid plaques restricted to the cortex, subcortical neurons with cortical projections degenerate suggesting that axonal exposure to Aβ 1–42 is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration over long distances ( Liu et al., 2008 ). Similarly, in AD patients’ brains monoaminergic neurodegeneration occurs in the locus coeruleus in the absence of local Aβ pathology ( Marcyniuk et al., 1986 ). Therefore, in order to understand the pathogenesis of AD it is crucial to investigate the intra-axonal signaling pathways triggered by Aβ 1–42 separately from its effects on soma and dendrites.

Compartmentalized signaling is especially important for neurons, the most morphologically polarized cells. In order to react to stimuli in a spatially and temporally acute manner, axons are able to synthesize a subset of proteins locally ( Jung et al., 2014 ). During development intra-axonal protein synthesis is crucial for growth cone behavior, axonal pathfinding, axon maintenance, and retrograde signaling ( Jung et al., 2014 ). After the developmental period, the composition of the axonally localized transcriptome changes ( Gumy et al., 2011 ), overall levels of mRNAs and ribosomes are lower ( Kleiman et al., 1994 ), and mature axons have long been thought to be incapable of protein synthesis. However, recent evidence shows that protein synthesis persists in post-developmental CNS axons in vivo ( Dubacq et al., 2009 ; Kar et al., 2014 ; Willis et al., 2011 ; Yoon et al., 2012 ). Additionally, upon injury of mature axons, a specific set of mRNAs and translation machinery are rapidly recruited into axons, and proteins are locally synthesized within mature axons ( Rishal and Fainzilber, 2014 ). In contrast to its well-established role during development and regeneration, the role of intra-axonal protein synthesis in the context of neurodegenerative disorders remains unexamined.

Here, we asked whether intra-axonal protein synthesis was activated in response to Aβ 1–42 and functionally relevant for the retrograde transmission of neurodegenerative signals across brain regions. We report that axonal translation is activated in response to Aβ 1–42 . Axonal ATF4 synthesis is required for the retrograde spread of Aβ 1–42 -induced neurodegeneration, and axons in brains of AD patients show more frequent localization of ATF4 protein and mRNA.

## RESULTS
To investigate whether central nervous system (CNS) neurons locally synthesize proteins in axons in response to oligomeric Aβ 1–42 , rat embryonic hippocampal neurons were grown in tripartite microfluidic chambers which allow for the fluidic isolation of axons from cell bodies and dendrites ( Figures 1A and 1B ) ( Hengst et al., 2009 ; Taylor et al., 2005 ). The small culture volume and the hydrophobicity of microfluidic chambers influences the effective concentrations of peptides ( Toepke and Beebe, 2006 ). We used an Aβ 1–42 concentration (3 µM) that is equivalent to ~250 nM in regular cultures ( Figure S1A ). Aβ concentrations in normal aging and AD brain range from ~2 pM to 2 µM, respectively ( Wang et al., 1999 ). First we determined the axonal abundance of two molecular markers of translation: p-4EBP1 and p-S6. Levels for 4EBP1 and p-4EBP1 were non-significantly elevated, whereas S6 and p-S6 levels were significantly increased in axons upon Aβ 1–42 treatment ( Figure 1C ). Cell body levels of 4EBP1 and p-4EBP1 did not change and levels of S6 and p-S6 were slightly reduced ( Figures 1C ). Aβ 1–42 selectively applied to the cell body compartment caused an increase in both 4EBP1 and p-4EBP1 levels in the soma that did not propagate to the axonal compartment ( Figures S1B and S1C ). Next, we used bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging to detect newly synthesized proteins ( Figure S1D ). No local protein synthesis was detected in axons treated for 24 h with vehicle, a scrambled Aβ 1–42 peptide or soluble oligomeric Aβ 1–40 while Aβ 1–42 -treated axons exhibited a significant increase in L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) incorporation ( Figure 1D ). Protein synthesis was detected in axons exposed to Aβ 1–42 for 48 h but not in axons treated for 24 h with Aβ 1–42 followed by a 24 h recovery period, indicating that local protein synthesis does not persist after removal of Aβ 1–42 ( Figure 1E ). AHA incorporation was prevented in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and emetine in the axonal but not the cell body compartment ( Figures 1F and S1E ). These results establish that axonally applied Aβ 1–42 activates local protein synthesis within 24 h.

Application of Aβ 1–42 to axons did not increase axonal fragmentation or cell death within 24 h, and after 48 h of Aβ 1–42 exposure the number of TUNEL-positive neurons was significantly greater while axonal fragmentation was not induced ( Figure 2A ). This effect was specific for Aβ 1–42 as neither the scrambled peptide nor Aβ 1–40 had any effect on cell death ( Figure 2B ). The observed neurodegeneration at 48 h is the result of pathogenic changes originating in the axons as only extremely little Aβ 1–42 was detected in the soma ( Figure 2C ).

To test whether Aβ 1–42 -induced intra-axonal protein synthesis was required for the induction of cell death, axons were treated with vehicle or Aβ 1–42 for 24 h in the absence or presence of anisomycin or emetine. To minimize toxic side effects of the protein synthesis inhibitors, axons were exposed to them only during the last 6 h of the Aβ 1–42 treatment period. A significant increase in TUNEL-positive and corresponding decrease in Calcein-positive neurons were observed upon treatment of axons with Aβ 1–42 ( Figures 2D and S2A ). Inhibition of intra-axonal protein synthesis completely abolished the effect of axonally applied Aβ 1–42 , demonstrating that intra-axonal protein synthesis is required for Aβ 1–42 -induced cell death.

To investigate whether transport from axons to soma was required for Aβ 1–42 -induced neurodegeneration we used the retrograde transport inhibitors ciliobrevin A and EHNA. Both inhibitors significantly reduced retrograde movement of axonal lysosomes in microfluidic chambers ( Figures S2B ). When applied during the last 6 h of the 24 h Aβ 1–42 treatment period, ciliobrevin A only partially abolished Aβ 1–42 -mediated cell death while EHNA had no effect ( Figures 2D and S2A ). However, both inhibitors completely abolished Aβ 1–42 -dependent cell death when applied during the last 6 h of the 48 h experiment, while application of anisomycin at this time did not interfere with cell death ( Figures 2E and S2C ), consistent with our finding that axonal protein synthesis is not persistent after the removal of Aβ 1–42 ( Figure 1E ). To ensure that the effect of the inhibitors was not due to alterations in the minute levels of Aβ 1–42 transported to the cells bodies, axons were treated as before, and cell bodies were immunostained for Aβ 1–42 . No correlation was found between somatic Aβ 1–42 levels and cell death ( Figure S2D ). These results establish that sequential intra-axonal protein synthesis and retrograde transport are required to transmit a neurodegenerative signal to the neuronal cell bodies in response to axonal Aβ 1–42 application.

To identify proteins that might transmit the neurodegenerative signal from axons to the soma, we performed RNA sequencing on total RNA isolated from vehicle and Aβ 1–42 -treated axons and their cell bodies. Only mRNAs with higher expression levels than previously reported non-axonal transcripts were included in our analysis ( Figure S3A ). The axonal transcriptomes of control and treated axons show only partial overlap ( Figure S3B ), indicating that exposure of axons to Aβ 1–42 triggers the recruitment of a specific cohort of mRNAs ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Among the axonally recruited mRNAs was the transcript coding for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). As a transcription factor ATF4 is a prime candidate for a retrogradely transported protein, and it can suppress the transcription of memory related genes and activate the transcription of proapoptotic genes in response to intracellular stress ( Ameri and Harris, 2008 ). Additionally, ATF4 is a key molecule of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway ( Ron and Harding, 2012 ), which is activated in many neurodegenerative diseases, possibly including AD ( Ma et al., 2013 ). Comparative analysis of the RNA-seq datasets and quantitative RT-PCR revealed an increase in axonal Atf4 abundance following Aβ 1–42 treatment while levels in cell bodies were unchanged, indicating that the upregulation of Atf4 in axons is likely the result of increased axonal transport rather than transcription ( Figures 3A ). No increase in Atf4 was detected in axons treated with vehicle control, Aβ scrambled , or Aβ 1–40 for 18 h ( Figure 3B ).

Axonal Atf4 mRNA levels determined by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were significantly increased following 6 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment and remained elevated until at least 24 h ( Figure 3C ). Similarly, ATF4 protein levels were significantly increased at 6, 12 and 18 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment but dropped to lower than control levels at 24 h ( Figure 3D ). The increase in ATF4 at 18 h was abolished by the local application of protein synthesis inhibitors ( Figure 3E ) that did not affect Atf4 mRNA localization in Aβ 1–42 -treated axons ( Figure S3C ). To unambiguously demonstrate local translation of Atf4 in axons we transfected Atf4 targeting siRNAs into axons. The RNAi pathway is functional in axons, enabling knockdown of axonal mRNAs without affecting somato-dendritic mRNA levels ( Hengst et al., 2006 ). Neither Atf4 siRNA significantly altered Atf4 levels in control axons but both blocked the increase of Atf4 in Aβ 1–42 -treated axons, with siRNA 1 decreasing Atf4 levels below control conditions ( Figure S3D ). In all subsequent experiments siRNA 1 was used. The siRNA’s effect was restricted to axons as ATF4 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged in cell bodies ( Figures S3E and S3F ). Selective knockdown of axonal Atf4 completely inhibited the increase in axonal ATF4 protein levels following 18 h of exposure to Aβ 1–42 ( Figure 3F ).

To test whether the drop in axonal ATF4 abundance at 24 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment was due to ATF4 transport to the soma, we applied retrograde transport inhibitors locally. Axonal ATF4 levels were significantly increased in axons after 24 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment when retrograde transport was inhibited ( Figure 3G, 3F and S3G ), but axonal Atf4 mRNA levels were unchanged ( Figure S3H ). Inhibition of intra-axonal but not somatic protein synthesis completely abolished the Aβ 1–42 -dependent increase of axonal ATF4 in the presence of ciliobrevin A ( Figure 3G ). ATF4 protein levels were significantly decreased in control or Atf4 siRNA transfected axons exposed to Aβ 1–42 , and the accumulation of ATF4 in ciliobrevin A treated axons in response to Aβ1–42 was completely abolished in Atf4 siRNA transfected axons ( Figure 3H ). These results establish that local application of Aβ 1–42 oligomers induces local ATF4 synthesis and its retrograde transport.

Atf4 belongs to a group of transcripts, whose translation is activated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α ( Ron and Harding, 2012 ). Total eIF2α levels in axons were significantly increased by 12 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment but returned to control levels by 24 h ( Figure 3I ). p-eIF2α levels were significantly increased starting at 6 h, first due to the increase in total eIF2α and starting at 18 h due to an increase in the p-eIF2α/eIF2α ratio ( Figure 3I ). The increase in p-eIF2α was much lower than the increase in Atf4 mRNA levels indicating the increase in axonal ATF4 protein might be primarily driven by increased Atf4 localization. At 24 h, when we had observed strong upregulation of general protein synthesis in axons, we also detected a significant activation of eIF2α. There are four mammalian eIF2α-kinases, including the ER stress activated kinase PERK ( Wek et al., 2006 ). Two activators of ER stress, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, did not trigger axonal recruitment of Atf4 mRNA at 18 h ( Figure 3J ), but both efficiently initiated ER-stress in neuronal cell bodies ( Figure S4A ), suggesting that local ER stress does not phenocopy the effect of Aβ 1–42 oligomers on Atf4 mRNA recruitment.

Next we asked if axonally derived ATF4 would function as a transcription factor in response to local application of Aβ 1–42 using an ATF4 firefly luciferase reporter gene construct. We also included an ATF6 luciferase reporter ( Wang et al., 2000 ) to investigate whether Aβ1–42 causes local ER stress leading to the activation of the ATF6 arm of the UPR. ATF4- or ATF6-dependent luciferase transcription was efficiently detected upon treatment of cell bodies with tunicamycin or thapsigargin for 24 h ( Figure S4A ). No firefly luciferase activity of either construct could be detected when axons were treated with vehicle, or following 24 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment ( Figure 4A ). However, 48 h after Aβ 1–42 exposure a significant increase in cell body ATF4 abundance ( Figure S4B ) and transcriptional activity was observed ( Figure 4A , left graph) while ATF6 activity remained undetectable ( Figure 4A , right graph). Thus, axonal exposure to Aβ 1–42 induces ATF4-but not ATF6-dependent transcription. Next we analyzed somatic expression of CHOP, a transcriptional target of ATF4 ( Averous et al., 2004 ), following 48 h of Aβ 1–42 treatment. CHOP expression was significantly increased in cell bodies in response to axonal Aβ 1–42 but not Aβ scrambled or Aβ 1–40 exposure ( Figures 4B and S4C ).

We then asked whether activation of ATF4-dependent gene expression was mediated by axonally synthesized ATF4. The ATF4 increase in cell bodies after Aβ 1–42 exposure was fully blocked by axonally applied anisomycin and partially blocked by ciliobrevin A ( Figure S4D ). Thus, we treated axons with Aβ 1–42 for 48 h, adding ciliobrevin A 6 h prior to sample processing and assessed ATF4 activity via luciferase and CHOP expression assays. In both assays inhibition of retrograde transport completely abolished the effect of axonal Aβ 1–42 ( Figures 4C and 4D ), and knockdown of axonal Atf4 prevented Aβ 1–42 -dependent transcription of luciferase, CHOP expression, or increase of ATF4 in cell bodies ( Figures 4E, 4F and S4E ), demonstrating that axonally synthesized ATF4 is required for ATF4-dependent gene expression after axonal Aβ 1–42 treatment.

Prolonged CHOP expression leads to cell death ( Zinszner et al., 1998 ), and therefore, we asked if Aβ 1–42 -dependent neurodegeneration was mediated by axonally synthesized ATF4. A significant induction of apoptosis and corresponding decrease in Calcein staining was found when control siRNA transfected axons were treated with Aβ 1–42 , whereas depletion of axonal Atf4 mRNA fully rescued the cells ( Figures 4G and S4F ). Additionally, Aβ 1–42 significantly increased the amount of TUNEL-positive nuclei in cell bodies transfected with control siRNA, but Chop knockdown blocked Aβ 1–42 -mediated neurodegeneration ( Figure 4H ).

These results reveal that local application of Aβ 1–42 triggers the intra-axonal synthesis and retrograde transport of ATF4, and these events are required for ATF4-dependent transcription leading to CHOP-dependent cell loss.

Next, we used a mouse model of semi-acute amyloidopathy by intra-hippocampal injection of Aβ 1–42 oligomers to analyze the in vivo relevance of our in vitro findings ( Sotthibundhu et al., 2008 ). In contrast to the more widely used transgenic mouse models for Aβ 1–42 amyloidopathy, this model allows the spatially restricted and temporally acute exposure of axons to elevated Aβ 1–42 levels. Intra-hippocampal injection of oligomeric Aβ 1–42 induces neurodegeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) within 2 weeks post-injection ( Sotthibundhu et al., 2008 ). BFCNs project their axons ipsi-laterally to the hippocampus ( Leranth and Frotscher, 1989 ), allowing the contra-lateral injection of vehicle to be utilized as a control in the same animal. Also, with the exception of very few cholinergic neuronal cell bodies in the dentate hilus, which can easily be avoided, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is a specific marker for BFCN axons ( Leranth and Frotscher, 1989 ).

We injected Aβ 1–42 into the DG and analyzed brain sections 2 to 7 days post injection (DPI) at sites adjacent to the injection where the DG layers were intact ( Figures 5A , S5A and S5B ). First, we confirmed the presence of oligomeric Aβ 1–42 in these sites at 2, 4 and 7 DPI ( Figure 5A ). Atf4 mRNA was readily detectable above background levels in cholinergic axons in all layers of the DG 2, 4 and 7 DPI in Aβ 1–42 - but not vehicle-injected hemispheres ( Figures 5B ). ChAT staining appeared to be more punctate in the vicinity of cell bodies, especially in the granule cell layer (GCL) and co-localized with synaptophysin staining in control hemispheres ( Figure S5B ), consistent with the known termination pattern of BFCN axons. Puncta were more evident over time in Aβ 1–42 -injected hemispheres suggesting synaptic/neuritic retraction. Atf4 granules were frequently found in these puncta, possibly indicating their localization to synaptic terminals and/or retracting synapses. However, no reduction in ChAT-positive features was seen in Aβ 1–42 -injected hemispheres even 7 DPI ( Figure S5C ). Also, no Atf4 above background was observed in granule cell bodies under any condition ( Figure S5D ).

p-S6 and ATF4 levels were significantly increased within ChAT-positive axons in the Aβ 1–42 -injected side 7 DPI ( Figures 5C and 5D ). In granule cells, a moderate increase in p-S6 and a strong upregulation of ATF4 were detected ( Figures S5E and S5F ), indicating that both axons and cell bodies respond to Aβ 1–42 by increasing ATF4 levels. To confirm synthesis of ATF4 within BFCN axons, both hemispheres of the brain were injected with Aβ 1–42 , and either a control siRNA or an Atf4 siRNA. At 7 DPI, Atf4 siRNA caused a completed knockdown of axonal Atf4 mRNA and significant reduction of ATF4 protein ( Figures 5E and 5F ) without causing axonal loss ( Figure S5I ). ATF4 protein was significantly reduced, and Atf4 mRNA remained undetectable in granule cells ( Figures S5G and S5H ). These results demonstrate that axons in the mature mammalian brain synthesize ATF4 and likely other proteins in response to Aβ 1–42 .

Next we investigated if ATF4-dependent gene expression was induced in BFCNs. Fluorogold was co-injected into both hemispheres of the brain to define the region of the basal forebrain from which axons close to the injection site originated. The unaffected detection of retrogradely transported fluorogold in the basal forebrains of all mice ( Figure S6A and S6B ) suggests that cholinergic afferents were functional and capable of retrograde transport. ATF4 levels in BFCNs were significantly increased at 2 and 4 DPI with a non-significant increase at 7 DPI ( Figure 6A , upper panels and left graph). ATF4 induction was evident in cholinergic neurons but not in all neurons present in the basal forebrain ( Figures S5C ). CHOP positive cholinergic neurons were significantly increased at 7 DPI ( Figure 6A , lower panels and right graph), indicating that ATF4-dependent gene expression was induced in the basal forebrain.

Next we quantified the number of ChAT-positive neurons to determine if Aβ 1–42 injected in the hippocampus was sufficient to induce neurodegeneration of BFCNs at some point between 2 and 7 days. Aβ 1–42 injection did not change the number of ChAT-positive neurons in the forebrain at 2 or 4 DPI, but caused a significant ~20% reduction at 7 DPI ( Figure 6B ). Conversely, no overall decrease was seen in NeuN-positive neurons ( Figure S6C , right graph) as expected considering that not only BFCNs resides in the basal forebrain. We confirmed these results using stereology as a complimentary approach ( Figure S6D and S6E , left graphs). A significant ~24% increase in TUNEL-positive cells was found in the Aβ 1–42 -injected hemisphere compared to the control hemisphere ( Figure 6C ). These results demonstrate that Aβ 1–42 injection into the hippocampus induces retrograde degeneration of BFCNs.

We had observed that ATF4 and CHOP induction was uneven across the basal forebrain suggesting a greater response of BFCNs in the nucleus in the diagonal band (NDB) than in the medial septum (MS). Indeed, a significant decrease in BFCNs was apparent only in the NDB, whereas cell death affected both nuclei to a similar extent ( Figures 6D and S6D , right graph), suggesting that cells other than BFCNs degenerate in the MS in response to Aβ 1–42 injection. Next we determined whether ATF4-dependent signaling in the basal forebrain required Aβ 1–42 -dependent Atf4 synthesis in cholinergic axons in the hippocampus. Consistent with our previous observations that ATF4 protein was not significantly induced in the basal forebrain at 7 DPI, no reduction was detected in Atf4 siRNA injected hemispheres ( Figure 6E , upper panels, left graph). However, Aβ 1–42 -dependent CHOP induction was significantly reduced by Atf4 siRNA in the NDB ( Figure 6E , lower panels, right graph). Thus, synthesis of ATF4 in the hippocampus induces ATF4-dependent signaling in BFCNs.

Finally, we sought to determine whether axonally derived ATF4 was required for the loss of BFCNs. Co-injection of Atf4 siRNA blocked the decrease in density of BFCNs in the NDB, in contrast to the MS, which remained unaffected ( Figures 6F and S6F , Supplemental Table S2 ). When compared to non-siRNA conditions (dashed lines in Figures 6F and 6G ), Atf4 siRNA reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the NDB by ~63% but restored the number of ChAT-positive neurons to normal levels. This discrepancy indicates that other cells in the forebrain die as well, but only BFCNs die in an Atf4-dependent manner. Additionally axonally synthesized ATF4 might cause a loss of cholinergic phenotype in BFCNs, as is suggested by the fact the number of NeuN positive cells does not decrease significantly in the forebrain upon Aβ 1–42 injection.

We observed a significant thinning of the GCL and increased cell death in DG exposed to Aβ 1–42 ( Figure S6G ), but Atf4 siRNA had no effect on the thickness of the GCL ( Figure S6H , left graph), and far from rescuing dying cells, Atf4 siRNA exacerbated cell death in the DG ( Figure S6H , right graph). Thus, the decrease in BFCNs was not caused by neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.

Finally, we analyzed the presence of ATF4 mRNA and protein in post mortem brain samples of 8 AD patients and 8 age-matched controls. Axons and cell bodies containing Atf4 mRNA granules were found in the hippocampal formation in all cases ( Figure 7A ). However, AD brains exhibited a higher frequency of Atf4 -containing axons in the hippocampus, the subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex ( Figure 7B ). A decrease was observed in Atf4 -positive cell bodies in the hippocampus of AD brains, but a higher frequency was found in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex ( Figure 7C ). In AD brains, ATF4-positive processes could be observed in the vicinity of amyloid plaques ( Figure 7D ). ATF4 was found in relatively intact processes and in beaded neurites ( Figure 7D ). More ATF4-positive axonal structures were found in the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex but not the hippocampus of AD brains ( Figure 7E ). ATF4-positive cell bodies ( Figure 7D ) were generally restricted to the subiculum and entorhinal cortex for both control and AD cases, with a higher frequency in the entorhinal cortex for AD cases ( Figure 7F ). The increased frequencies of ATF4 mRNA and protein in axons in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of AD patients are highly suggestive of intra-axonal ATF4 synthesis in those regions of the brain that are especially vulnerable in AD ( Khan et al., 2014 ). The results from human brain samples, although correlative, closely mirror our findings in hippocampal neurons and in the adult mouse brain providing evidence for the pathophysiological significance of our proposed model ( Figure S6I ).

## DISCUSSION
Several prior studies have demonstrated the importance of local translation for axon maintenance ( Yoon et al., 2012 ), mitochondrial function ( Kar et al., 2014 ) and survival ( Cox et al., 2008 ), and suppression of local translation of lb2 mRNA causes neurodegeneration in vivo ( Yoon et al., 2012 ). Here we report another dimension of local protein synthesis: in response to a physiologically relevant neurodegenerative stimulus axonal protein synthesis plays an active role in the transmission of neurodegeneration. Rather than acting solely as a factor in cellular homeostasis, local protein synthesis can be a major component of neuronal dyshomeostasis under pathological conditions.

Our finding that oligomeric Aβ 1–42 application to distal axons triggers the rapid recruitment and local translation of a distinct set of mRNAs is reminiscent of the activation of local translation upon nerve injury ( Rishal and Fainzilber, 2014 ). However, the changes to the axonal transcriptome appear to be unique to the exposure of distal axons to oligomeric Aβ 1–42 . For example we find that the transcriptome of Aβ 1–42 -treated axons contains mRNAs of many AD related genes, including transcripts for 4 out of the current list of 20 AD susceptibility loci ( Lambert et al., 2013 ): APP, ApoE, Clu, and FERMT2. These proteins function in Aβ 1–42 production (APP) and metabolism (Apoe, Clu), and have been implicated in tau pathology (FERMT2) ( Shulman et al., 2014 ). The post-transcriptional regulation of these genes by Aβ 1–42 suggests that these proteins might function in feedback mechanisms downstream of amyloid-pathology in AD.

Transcriptional changes in AD brain or in response to Aβ 1–42 have been extensively studied in various experimental settings ( Miller and Geschwind, 2010 ). While these studies have provided valuable insight into the signaling pathways affected in Aβ 1–42 pathology, many of the mRNAs we identified as regulated by Aβ 1–42 in axons have never before been described to be changed in response to Aβ 1–42 . This is likely due to the fact that they are post-transcriptionally regulated, rather than by increased promoter activity; in fact we did not observe an overall up- or down-regulation for the vast majority of the axonally localized mRNAs. Our study is thus a demonstration that post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression must be taken into account when investigating changes in gene expression. Especially in morphologically polarized cells such as neurons, mRNA localization can be as functionally relevant as transcriptional regulation, and disorders of the nervous system cannot be completely understood without the consideration of translational mechanisms.

We found that the increase of ATF4-positive BFCNs is greater than the observed cell loss, suggesting a model in which ATF4 is not directly leading to the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes but rather triggers the expression of a variety of genes whose functions cause pathogenic changes in the neurons, leading to cell death as a secondary effect. The finding that Atf4 siRNA is more efficient in rescuing the loss of ChAT-positive BCFNs than in preventing apoptosis supports this model. Our finding that BFCNs in the MS and NDB react differentially to Aβ 1–42 injection into the DG indicates that the exact transcriptional response to axonally derived ATF4 differs between cell types. In fact, depending on the context, ATF4 in neurons has variously been described as pro-apoptotic, pro-survival, or memory suppressing ( Ameri and Harris, 2008 ). It is possible that in response to low-levels of eIF2α phosphorylation, as has been seen in AD patients’ brains and AD model mice ( Ma et al., 2013 ), ATF4 acts mainly in a neuroprotective and memory suppressing manner while upon prolonged exposure to Aβ 1–42 it can contribute to cell death.

Our study adds to a growing body of evidence that some transcription factors are axonally synthesized ( Ji and Jaffrey, 2014 ). It remains an unanswered question what might be the advantage of synthesizing a transcription factor in axons. In the case of ATF4 an appealing idea is that local synthesis might favor dimerization with an otherwise outcompeted binding partner. ATF4 binds promoter sequences either as a homodimer or a heterodimer ( Ameri and Harris, 2008 ). The relative abundance of potential binding partners in axons could favor the formation of other heterodimers in axons than in cell bodies leading to differential transcriptional activities.

AD progression is characterized by the spread of pathology throughout the brain. Interfering with the spread would be an ideal approach to slow the decline of cognitive function that is characteristic of AD. Our results unravel a mechanism for the spread of disease that is based on the retrograde transport of ATF4. In this model, the exposure of axons to pathological levels of Aβ 1–42 leads to neuron-wide pathogenic changes due to pathogenic alterations in gene expression. Our finding that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atf4 mRNA in axons alone is sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in response to acutely applied Aβ 1–42 in vivo indicates a an unexpected target for a future therapy. Indeed, small molecules exist that could be used to repress ATF4 expression in the brain ( Moreno et al., 2013 ; Sidrauski et al., 2013 ).

In conclusion, we describe a pathway through which a neurodegenerative signal is transmitted from the periphery of neurons to the soma across macroscopic distances in the brain. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the spread of parts of the pathological changes in AD brain and potentially indicate new avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions for AD.

To apply peptides, inhibitors or siRNA specifically to axons, rat embryonic hippocampal neurons were grown in tripartite microfluidic chambers with two 200-µm-long microgrooves barriers ( Taylor et al., 2005 ). Synthetic Aβ 1–42 peptides were oligomerized ( Stine et al., 2003 ) and applied to the axonal compartment at 3 µM at 9–10 DIV. Whenever stated, the axonal or cell body compartments were treated with 10 µM anisomycin, 500 nM emetine, 30 µM ciliobrevin A, 10 µM EHNA, 10 µg ml −1 tunicamycin, or 1 µM thapsigargin, or transfected with siRNA using NeuroPORTER (Genlantis, San Diego, CA).

Axons were exposed to Aβ 1–42 or vehicle for 24 h. Total RNA was purified from the cell bodies and axons using the PrepEase RNA isolation kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). cDNA libraries were created using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (paired-end, 2× 150 bp) with biological replicates. Reads were aligned to the rat genome (Rn5) and counted using DESeq2.

Total RNA from the cell bodies and the axonal compartments was isolated as above, reverse transcribed, pre-amplified with the TaqMan PreAmp Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and real time RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan Gene Expression master mix and the Atf4 gene expression set (Rn00824644_g1). Gene expression was normalized to input RNA.

Atf4 mRNA in hippocampal neurons was detected by quantitative FISH using a mixture of in vitro transcribed, digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes following establish protocols ( Hengst et al., 2009 ). FISH on sections of mouse and human brain was performed with RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell bodies of hippocampal neurons were transfected using NeuroPORTER with an ATF4-(Promega) or ATF6-firefly reporter (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and a Renilla luciferase construct (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was measured 24 or 48 h after Aβ 1–42 treatment using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).

Stereotaxic were performed following Sotthibundhu et al. (2008) . 9–12-month-old C57Bl/6J mice were anesthetized, and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Stereotaxic injections were conducted using convection-enhanced delivery at a rate of 0.5 µl min −1 using the Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting) (coordinates from bregma: anterior-posterior, −2.00 mm; medial-lateral, ±1.3 mm; dorsal-ventral, −2.2 mm) resulting in an estimated Aβ 1–42 concentration in the DG of ~30 nM. Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed for all mouse experimentation.

Post mortem brain samples of AD patients and age-matched controls were obtained from the New York Brain Bank. 8 µm paraffin embedded sections were analyzed histochemically for the presence of ATF4 protein or by RNAscope for Atf4 mRNA.

When comparing multiple groups, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed. To compare two groups, t -tests were used.
