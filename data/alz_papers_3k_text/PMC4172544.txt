# Title
TDP-43 is a key player in the clinical features associated with
Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine whether the TAR DNA-binding
protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) independently has any effect on the clinical and
neuroimaging features typically ascribed to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
pathology, and whether TDP-43 pathology could help shed light on the phenomenon
of resilient cognition in AD. Three-hundred forty-two subjects pathologically
diagnosed with AD were screened for the presence, burden and distribution of
TDP-43. All had been classified as cognitively impaired or normal, prior to
death. Atlas-based parcellation and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess
regional atrophy on MRI. Regression models controlling for age at death,
apolipoprotein ε4 and other AD-related pathologies were utilized to
explore associations between TDP-43 and cognition or brain atrophy, stratified
by Braak stage. Additionally, we determined whether the effects of TDP-43 were
mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. One-hundred ninety-five (57%) cases
were TDP-positive. After accounting for age, apolipoprotein ε4, and
other pathologies, TDP-43 had a strong effect on cognition, memory loss, and
medial temporal atrophy in AD. These effects were not mediated by hippocampal
sclerosis. TDP-positive subjects were 10× more likely to be cognitively
impaired at death compared to TDP-negative subjects. Greater cognitive
impairment and medial temporal atrophy were associated with greater TDP-43
burden and more extensive TDP-43 distribution. TDP-43 is an important factor in
the manifestation of the clinico-imaging features of AD. TDP-43 also appears to
be able to overpower what has been termed resilient brain aging. TDP-43
therefore should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment
of AD.

## INTRODUCTION
Since the time of Alzheimer himself [ 2 ], two proteins, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposited in senile plaques, and
tau deposited in neurofibrillary tangles, have become tantamount to
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [ 9 ].
Neurofibrillary tangles progress throughout the brain in a stereotypic pattern
defined by the Braak staging scheme [ 9 ]. This
staging scheme correlates with cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in AD [ 18 , 20 , 44 ]. However, a significant
proportion of patients with AD pathology remain clinically normal up to the time of
death despite the presence of both neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques [ 15 ]. Little is known about this phenomenon and
whether other proteins may also be playing a role.

A third protein, the TAR DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43), has however
recently been found to be present in the brains of subjects with pathologically
diagnosed AD [ 3 , 4 , 8 , 14 , 24 , 26 , 43 ].
TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein that functions in exon skipping and is identified
in an abnormal phosphorylated state in cellular inclusions [ 11 ]. TDP-43 is associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive
impairment [ 34 ] yet it is unknown whether
TDP-43 plays any role in what has been considered “the AD neurodegenerative
process” or whether TDP-43 could help explain why some patients remain
clinically normal, while others do not, despite both having similar degrees of AD
pathology.

The primary aim of this study was to determine whether TDP-43 is
independently associated with cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in AD, and
hence an important contributor to the AD phenotype. A secondary aim was to determine
whether cognitive impairment and atrophy would correlate with TDP-43 burden or the
distribution of TDP-43 (number of brain regions showing TDP-43
immunoreactivity).

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
All cases were identified from the Mayo Clinic neuropathological
database, Rochester, MN and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1)
intermediate-high probability AD diagnosis according to the National Institute
on Aging and the Reagan Institute criteria (NIA-Reagan) [ 47 ], (2) Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage IV–VI
[ 9 ], and (3) available formalin fixed
paraffin blocks of brain tissue regions. Three-hundred and forty-six cases were
identified; four were excluded for not having available paraffin blocks,
resulting in 342 cases being included in this study. All subjects were
prospectively recruited and followed in the Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center or Patient Registry between 1992 and 2010.

All subjects had undergone a clinical evaluation by a dementia
specialist, completed neuropsychological testing and were determined to be
cognitively normal or cognitively impaired before death. The determination of
cognitive status was based on consensus of a team of scientists utilizing data
generated from detailed clinical and neuropsychological evaluations. For this
study, we analyzed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ 17 ] as a measure of general cognitive
impairment, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) [ 31 ] as a measure of functional impairment,
Boston Naming Test (BNT) [ 27 ] as a
measure of confrontational naming, memory subscale of the Dementia Rating Scale
(mDRS) [ 29 ] as a measure of loss of
episodic memory, brief questionnaire version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory
(NPI-Q) [ 28 ] as a measure of behavioral
impairment, and cognitive status, at the final evaluation before death.
Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotyping was performed, as previously
described[ 13 , 23 ].

Neuropathological examinations were performed according to
recommendations of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD)[ 30 ]. Every specimen was assigned a Braak
stage[ 9 ] using modified Bielschowsky
silver stain, on the basis of the earliest appearance of neurofibrillary
tangles. Lewy bodies and infarcts were documented, and Aβ burden
measured using CERAD recommendations [ 30 ]. Hippocampal sclerosis (HpScl) was diagnosed if neuronal loss in the
subiculum and CA1 regions of the hippocampus was out of proportion to the burden
of neurofibrillary tangles [ 16 ].

This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. All patients or their
proxies provided written informed consent before participating in any research
activity.

Amygdala blocks were sectioned and immunostained for TDP-43 (polyclonal
antibody MC2085 that recognizes a peptide sequence in the 25-kDa C-terminal
fragment[ 48 ]) with a DAKO-Autostainer
(DAKO-Cytomaton, Carpinteria, California) and 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine as
the chromogen. Sections were lightly counterstained with Hematoxylin. Amygdala
sections were screened (by DWD), to assess for the presence of TDP-43
immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, or neuronal
intranuclear inclusions ( Figure 1 ). We
screened the amygdala as the amygdala has been shown to be the first region
affected in AD by TDP-43 pathology[ 19 ].
Any AD case not showing TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the amygdala was considered
TDP-negative ( Figure 2a ), while any AD case
showing any amount of TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the amygdala was considered
TDP-positive ( Figure 2b–d ). Hence,
amygdaloid positivity was all that was necessary to call an individual AD case
TDP-43 positive. For TDP-positive cases, we sectioned additional paraffin blocks
of the middle frontal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal cortices,
nucleus basalis, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla using the same protocol as
described above for the amygdala. The following 14 distinct brain regions per
case were reviewed simultaneously with a multi-headed microscope (by DWD and
KAJ) for TDP-43 immunoreactivity: amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum,
hippocampal dentate fascia, occipitotemporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex,
basal forebrain, insula, ventral striatum, frontal lobe, basal ganglia,
substantia nigra, midbrain tegmentum, and inferior olive. A region was
considered positive if TDP-43 immunoreactive lesions were observed at
20× magnification screening the entire region, with subsequent
confirmation at 40× magnification. The number of cases with TDP-43
immunoreactivity for each of the 14 regions is shown in Figure 3 .

To ensure antibody sensitivity, we additionally screened amygdala
sections from 10% of the TDP-negative cases using a different antibody
against phosphorylated TDP-43 peptide (1:5,000 rabbit polyclonal anti-human
phosphoserine 409/410). None of the cases that had initially screened negative
with the polyclonal antibody MC2085 showed TDP-43 immunoreactivity with the
phosphorylated antibody, ensuring excellent sensitivity of MC2085.

TDP-43 burden was assessed in the hippocampal dentate fascia using the
Aperio slide scanner and a customized color deconvolution algorithm enabling the
detection of any abnormal TDP-43 ( Figure
4 ). The dentate fascia was selected for the burden analysis since the
dentate fascia has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with memory
loss [ 36 ]. TDP-43 immunostained sections
of the posterior hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate were scanned
at ultra-resolution on the ScanScope XT (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). This
instrument permits scanning of the entire slide from which large areas of
interest can be annotated using ImageScope version 11.2 (Aperio Technologies,
Vista, CA). The method greatly increases the sampling frame compared to some
other image analysis systems that are limited to the field of view of the
microscope or require image tiling [ 38 ].
The entirety of the dentate fascia was assessed to quantitatively determine
TDP-43 immunohistochemical burden. To operationalize annotation of the dentate
fascia, the ruler tool was used to measure 125µm across the granule cell
layer to molecular layer to avoid quantification variability resulting from
tissue sectioning differences. Any dust or dirt particles or tissue folds were
excluded using the negative trace tool. Annotated layers were analyzed in
Spectrum version 11.2 (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) using a custom-designed
color deconvolution algorithm, as previously described [ 22 ]. After applying the color deconvolution algorithm, each
high resolution image was reviewed independently by two investigators (MM
& AL) in order to ensure that only abnormal TDP-43 was being measured.
Cases where the algorithm was unable to separate abnormal TDP-43 from normal
nuclear TDP-43, were removed from further analysis of TDP-43 burden (n=20).
TDP-43 burden was then expressed as the area of immunoreactive pixels to the
total area of the annotated region.

Two-hundred and forty-eight subjects had an antemortem volumetric MRI
performed with a standardized protocol [ 21 ]. The MRI closest to death was selected for each subject to
correspond to the clinical data. Two-hundred and twenty subjects were scanned at
1.5T. A reference group for volumetric analysis included 46 healthy controls
that had antemortem MRI and normal pathological diagnosis (Braak 0-III,
NIA-Reagan no/low) and were TDP-negative (mean age=82±6, 46%
female). Gradient non-linearity and intensity non-uniformity corrections were
applied.

Grey matter volumes of specific regions-of-interest were calculated
using atlas-based parcellation in SPM5 and the automated anatomic labeling
atlas[ 42 ], as previously described
[ 45 ]. Volumes were calculated for
medial temporal regions (hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex) and
association cortices (fusiform gyrus, medial and lateral frontal and parietal
lobes, and lateral temporal lobe). Left and right volumes were averaged.
Regional volumes were scaled by total intracranial volume [ 46 ] to correct for head size. Grey matter atrophy was also
assessed at the voxel-level using voxel-based morphometry (VBM)[ 6 ]. Standard preprocessing steps were
employed, including normalization to a customized template, unified segmentation
[ 7 ], modulation and smoothing at 8mm
full-width at half-maximum. A VBM “full-factorial” (i.e. ANCOVA)
model was used to compare TDP-negative and TDP-positive subjects to controls
(p<0.05 using family wise error correction), and to each other
(uncorrected p<0.001). Comparisons were performed separately at Braak
IV, V and VI. Age, gender and total intracranial volume were included as
covariates in all analyses.

We used linear, binary logistic, and ordinal logistic regression models
to estimate associations between outcome variables and TDP-43. In our first
modeling analysis we treated TDP-43 status as a binary predictor.

In order to better understand the relationship between TDP-43 and
cognition and brain atrophy while taking into account the Braak neurofibrillary
tangle stage, we stratified by Braak stage and tested for additive associations
and interactions between TDP-43 and Braak using linear or logistic regression
adjusted for age at death. This analysis allowed us to investigate whether the
association between TDP-43 and cognition/brain atrophy differed across Braak
stage IV, V and VI. We extended this analysis in two ways to account for any
potential genetic or other pathological confounders: (1) to account for
confounding effects due to APOE, infarctions, Lewy bodies, neuritic plaques
(CERAD) we included these variables as covariates in our models. (2) In order to
address the issue of whether the TDP-43 effects were wholly or partly mediated
by HpScl we added this factor to the models and evaluated the resulting
HpScl-adjusted TDP associations. We encountered the problem of logistic
regression separation in models involving the cognitive impairment outcome. This
was because all 104 TDP-positive subjects at Braak stage VI were cognitively
impaired and thus in this subgroup there were no “non-events”.
To address this problem we used weakly informative variance stabilizing data
augmentation priors for the coefficient corresponding to the Braak VI by TDP-43
interaction [ 40 ]. This method is very
closely related to the popular approach of adding one success and one failure
when estimating a proportion [ 1 ]. Our
priors specified that on the odds ratio scale 95% of the prior
probability was in the range 1/16 to 16 which serves to conservatively shrink
estimates towards the null.

For our secondary analyses we modeled the outcome variables as a
function of TDP-43 burden and as a function of the number of brain regions
positive for TDP-43 (i.e. distribution). These analyses were limited only to
subjects who were TDP-positive. Quantitative TDP-43 burden was expressed as a
percentage of pixels showing immunoreactivity. We rank transformed the numeric
value because of extreme right skewness ( Figure
3 ). So that a 1-unit increase was more interpretable, we divided the
rank-transformed value by 40 to obtain a uniformly distributed predictor with a
max (and range) of ~4. In these analyses we assessed three models that
included: age at death alone; age at death and Braak stage given our interest in
Braak stage; and age at death, APOE, Braak stage, CERAD, Lewy bodies, infarcts
and HpScl as adjustment covariates to remove the potential confounding effect of
all these variables.

## RESULTS
One hundred-ninety five cases (57%) were TDP-positive. After
accounting for age at death, the TDP-positive subjects had a higher proportion of
APOE ε4 carriers, and worse performance on MMSE, CDR-SB, BNT and mDRS than
the TDP-negative subjects ( Table 1 ). The
TDP-positive group had a lower proportion of subjects who were cognitively normal at
death (2% vs 19%). The TDP-positive group had higher Braak stage,
and higher proportions of Lewy bodies and HpScl. Volumes of all medial temporal
structures and fusiform gyrus were smaller in the TDP-positive group compared to the
TDP-negative group, with no differences observed in other association cortices.

After accounting for age at death, CERAD, APOE ε4, infarcts,
Braak stage, and Lewy bodies, TDP-43 had an additive effect on cognitive
impairment, MMSE, mDRS, CDR-SB and BNT ( Figure
5 ). When we further account for HpScl in our mediation analysis, the
additive effect of TDP-43 on cognitive impairment and BNT remained significant
with similar trends persisting for MMSE, mDRS and CDR-SB. ( Figure 5 ). An interaction, in addition to an additive effect
beyond Braak, was observed for MMSE and CDR-SB. Specifically, a greater
difference was observed between TDP-positive and TDP-negative groups at Braak IV
and V. For example, a greater than 4-point difference on MMSE was observed at
Braak stages IV and V between TDP-positive and TDP-negative subjects, while less
than a 2-point difference was observed for MMSE at Braak stage VI.

Similar to the clinical outcomes, after accounting for age at death,
CERAD, APOE ε4, infarcts, Braak stage, and Lewy bodies, TDP-43 had an
additive effect on hippocampal, amygdala and entorhinal cortex volumes ( Figure 6 ). When we further account for HpScl
in our mediation analysis, the additive effect of TDP-43 on hippocampal volume
remained significant with similar trends persisting for the amygdala and
entorhinal cortex volumes ( Figure 6 ). No
added interactions were observed for these medial temporal volumes. Conversely,
interactions, but no additive effects of TDP-43 were observed on the association
cortex volumes.

On VBM, the TDP-positive AD subjects showed progressive worsening of
volume loss with increasing Braak, when compared to the 46 healthy control
subjects ( Figure 7 ). The TDP-negative AD
subjects showed no volume loss at Braak IV and only a tiny area of focal loss at
Braak V, when compared to the healthy controls. When the TDP-positive and
TDP-negative subjects were directly compared, the TDP-positive subjects showed
greater medial temporal loss than the TDP-negative subjects at all Braak stages.
Conversely, the TDP-negative subjects showed no regions of greater loss than the
TDP-positive subjects, except at Braak VI, where more parieto-occipital loss was
observed.

A strong correlation was observed between TDP-43 burden and distribution
(Spearman correlation=0.74, p<0.001). After accounting for age at death,
CERAD, APOE ε4, infarcts, Braak stage, Lewy bodies and HpScl, TDP-43
burden and TDP-43 distribution was associated with many clinical and
neuroimaging variables ( Table 2 and Table 3 ). Fort all these associations,
clinical performance worsened and volume loss increased with higher TDP-43
burden in the dentate gyrus, and as more regions were affected by TDP-43.

## DISCUSSION
In this large clinico-imaging-pathological study, we demonstrate that TDP-43
is associated with the major features of AD: memory loss and medial temporal
atrophy. In fact, in the presence of less severe AD pathology, the absence of TDP-43
was strongly associated with normal cognition. Consequently, TDP-43 appears to play
an important role in the cognitive and neuroimaging characteristics that have been
linked to AD.

The findings from this study challenge the perception that Aβ and
tau are the only important proteins accounting for the clinical features of AD by
demonstrating that TDP-43 also has an effect on the core clinical and neuroimaging
features considered pathognomonic for AD. Importantly, the effects of TDP-43 on
cognition and atrophy occurred after taking into account AD related pathogenetic
potential confounders, including Braak stage, and hence tau, the presence of Lewy
bodies, Aβ, infarctions and APOE ε4. The effects of TDP-43 also
persisted after taking into account HpScl. Therefore, although HpScl likely
influences cognition and brain atrophy when present in AD [ 10 , 33 , 35 ], the effects of TDP-43 on the clinical and
imaging variables assessed in our cohort were not mediated by HpScl. This suggests
that TDP-43 itself is an important factor. The fact that TDP-43 had an effect on
these outcome variables at Braak IV, which represents mild AD, is evidence that
TDP-43 is not just a feature of severe pathology. In fact, the differences between
TDP-positive and TDP-negative groups were most striking at Braak IV and V. One
explanation for this finding is that TDP-43 plays a more important role in the early
stages of AD, but once tau deposition is widespread, i.e. Braak VI, the importance
of TDP-43 becomes somewhat overshadowed. Alternatively, it is also possible that the
effects of TDP-43 at Braak VI are just as strong as they are at Braak IV and V, but
are more difficult to detect since the range of cognitive values at Braak VI are
likely to be truncated given that most subjects are severely affected at this
stage.

One of the most important findings of this study was that the absence of
TDP-43 was strongly associated with normal cognition, despite subjects with and
without TDP-43 having similar degrees of AD pathology. In our sample, approximately
one third of the TDP-negative Braak IV and V subjects were cognitively normal,
compared to only 4% of the TDP-positive Braak IV and V subjects. Given that
the TDP-positive Braak IV and V groups showed greater medial temporal atrophy than
the TDP-negative Braak IV and V subjects, it appears that the presence of TDP-43
creates a synergistic effect with the AD pathology. A similar effect has also been
previously reported to occur with vascular pathology [ 39 ] and with argyrophilic grains disease [ 25 , 41 ]. It therefore
appears that the resilience of some subjects to AD pathology can be overpowered by
the presence of TDP-43. These findings help to further shed light on those subjects
that remain cognitively unimpaired despite having AD pathology [ 5 , 15 , 37 ]. Previous studies have
suggested that cognitively resilient subjects may have lower burdens of Aβ
fibrillar plaques, oligomeric Aβ deposits or hyperphosphorylated tau in
synapses [ 37 ], or preserved densities of
presynaptic terminals and dentritic spines [ 5 ]; although none of these studies assessed TDP-43. We now know that such
subjects are also less likely to have TDP-43.

An association was also identified between APOE ε4,
a major risk factor for AD [ 12 ], and TDP-43.
The proportion of subjects with the APOE ε4 allele was
higher in the presence of TDP-43 across all Braak stages. At Braak VI, for example,
approximately three-quarters of the TDP-positive subjects had the APOE ε4 allele; a higher proportion than typically
observed in AD [ 32 ]. It is therefore probable
that APOE ε4 increases the risk of TDP-43 pathology; an
association not previously recognized. However, APOE ε4,
like Lewy body disease, Aβ deposition, infarctions and HpScl, was not a
confounder of the observed associations with TDP-43.

An intriguing observation was the atypical characteristics of the Braak VI
TDP-negative group. This group showed widespread atrophy, yet the atrophy pattern
was unusual when compared to the Braak VI TDP-positive group, with more atrophy in
cortical association regions and less atrophy in medial temporal regions. This group
of subjects was approximately 10 years younger than all other groups and is
reminiscent of the hippocampal sparing variant of AD, which typically is associated
with younger age, relatively greater cortical atrophy, an atypical distribution of
neurofibrillary tangles [ 32 , 46 ], and absence of TDP-43 [ 8 ]. It is unlikely that TDP-43 is protective
against involvement of the cortex and more likely that the greater cortical atrophy
in the TDP-negative subjects is being driven by a greater burden of cortical tau in
these younger subjects [ 32 , 46 ]. Conversely, the greater hippocampal
atrophy observed in the older TDP-positive subjects is likely associated with the
presence of TDP-43. It therefore appears that tau and TDP-43 may have distinct
effects in AD as shown in these models from our cohort that presumably generalizes
to the general population ( Figure 8 ).

The co-existence of the hallmark AD pathologies of Aβ and tau, along
with TDP-43, could be interpreted in two ways. First, TDP-43 is simply a
pathological feature of AD. Arguments supporting this hypothesis are (1) the fact
that the TDP-negative subjects were more likely to be cognitively normal and show
atypical patterns of atrophy, and (2) that important factors that are associated
with Braak stage, and hence tau pathology, were also associated with TDP-43,
including APOE ε4, memory loss and medial temporal atrophy.
One strong argument against this interpretation however is the fact that there were
many AD subjects without TDP-43 that were cognitively impaired. The second more
likely possibility is that the presence of TDP-43 represents a secondary or
independent pathology that shares overlapping features with AD by targeting the
medial temporal lobe. If this latter interpretation is correct then TDP-43 may have
obscured our view of the true AD clinico-imaging phenotype, given that such a high
proportion of AD cases have TDP-43.

We acknowledge that our outcome measures were not all independent. However,
since our aim was not to determine which outcome variable is most affected by
TDP-43, and the fact that all the variables we assessed for the study are strongly
associated with AD, our approach was very reasonable. We also note that our data for
TDP-43 deposition in the dentate gyrus was highly right skewed. However, we
addressed this potential problem by rank transforming the burden data prior to our
modelling analyses. We did not address the issue of the spatial distribution of
TDP-43 in AD given that we have previously done so and describe five stages for
TDP-43 deposition in AD for this exact cohort [ 26 ]. In fact, all five stages were roughly equally represented. Hence
our data was not biased by the overrepresentation of early or late stages.

In this study we demonstrate that TDP-43 is an important player in the AD
field, particularly during the early phases of neurodegeneration. Our findings
suggest that in order to be cognitively resilient TDP-43 must be absent. That is,
the synergistic effect of having TDP-43 results in cognitive impairment. TDP-43
therefore should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the future
treatment of AD.
