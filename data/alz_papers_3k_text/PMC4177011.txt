Neural compensation in older people with brain β-amyloid deposition

# Abstract
The recruitment of additional neural resources may allow elderly adults to maintain normal cognition despite β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques. Previous fMRI studies have reported such hyperactivation, but it is currently unclear if these increases represent compensation or aberrant over-excitation. We found that older adults with Aβ deposition had reduced deactivations in task negative regions, but increased activation in task positive regions related to more detailed memory encoding. The association between higher activity levels and more detailed memories suggests that Aβ-related hyperactivation is a compensatory mechanism, potentially reflecting brain plasticity in response to Aβ deposition.

## Online Methods
Seventy-four healthy elderly subjects underwent [ 11 C]PIB-PET and fMRI scanning and 31 young subjects underwent fMRI scanning for this study (see Table 1 for subject characteristics). MRI scans were acquired within an average of 72 days of the PET scan (SD=181.6 days, range=0–1,263 days, median=25 days). The subject with a delay of 1,263 days was strongly PIB+, and thus would be expected to remain in this group over time. All elderly subjects underwent a detailed battery of neuropsychological tests described previously 21 . All subjects were a subgroup of individuals who were recruited from the community via newspaper advertisements, talks at senior centers, or word of mouth; young subjects were recruited from online subject registries. All subjects underwent a medical interview and a detailed battery of neuropsychological tests. In order to be eligible for the study, older subjects were required to be 65 years or older, live independently in the community without neurological or psychiatric illness, and have no major medical illness or medication that influenced cognition. All subjects' neuropsychological performance was within age-adjusted normal range (i.e., within 1.5 SD from the mean scores). Although longitudinal follow-up data on these older subjects are not available yet, none of subjects reported cognitive symptoms at the time of participation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 carrier status was determined for older subjects using previously published methods 22 . All subjects provided informed consent in accordance with the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Twenty-five elderly and 9 young subjects were excluded due to poor performance (<45% hit rate on the gist task; N = 8), problems with data collection (behavioral, MRI or PET; N = 11), or excessive motion (N = 15), resulting in a total number of 49 cognitively normal old and 22 young subjects for data analysis. Eight elderly and one young subject included in the present study participated in an experiment of episodic memory encoding previously published from our laboratory 7 . There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of subjects excluded for any of the above reasons.

The memory task used here was adapted from Qin et al. 9 . Subjects completed a scanned encoding session during which 150 pictures of scenes were presented over 3 functional runs ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Images were presented on a black background for 6.6s, during which subjects responded whether there were people or no people in the scene with a button press using a 4-button response box using either thumb (response mappings were counterbalanced across subjects). A white fixation cross then appeared for 1–4 TRs (mean ITI = 4s) before moving on to the next trial.

Following a 15 minute delay, the subsequent memory test phase took place outside of the scanner on a desktop computer. This session was composed of two tasks that we refer to as the gist and details tasks, each split into 3 blocks. During the gist task, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, subjects were presented a total of 150 written descriptions of studied scenes, intermixed with 150 descriptions of unstudied scenes. Subjects were instructed to decide whether each description was associated with an old (presented during encoding) or new (not presented during study) scene as well as their confidence in the response (high or low). During the details task, which lasted approximately 90 minutes, only memory for the 150 scenes presented at encoding was assessed. For each encoded item, subjects were first presented the associated gist description, followed by a set of 6 details related to the scene. Subjects were instructed to respond whether each detail was true or false. The number of true details varied randomly from 2–4 across trials. Responses were made with a key press and subjects were given a maximum of 10s to respond for each item. The order of item presentation during the memory tests was varied randomly for each subject.

[ 11 C]PIB (PIB) was synthesized at the LBNL Biomedical Isotope Facility using a published protocol and described in detail previously 23 . PIB-PET imaging was performed at LBNL using an ECAT EXACT HR or BIOGRAPH Truepoint 6 scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) in 3D acquisition mode. Approximately 15 mCi of PIB was injected into an antecubital vein. Immediately upon injection, dynamic acquisition frames were obtained as follows: 4 × 15 sec, 8 × 30 sec, 9 × 60 sec, 2 × 180sec, 10 × 300sec, and 2 × 600 sec (90 min total). Ten minute transmission scans for attenuation correction or x-ray CT were obtained for each PIB scan. PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation. Images were smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter correction.

Subjects were scanned in a 1.5T Magnetom Avanto (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) scanner at LBNL. Each of the 3 functional runs were acquired with a T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence [TR=2200ms; TE=50; flip angle=90°; matrix=64×64; FOV=220mm; voxel size=3.44×3.44×3.4mm, duration=9 minutes]. 28 axial slices oriented to the AC-PC were acquired in an interleaved order giving whole brain coverage. Two-hundred and forty-six volumes were collected during each of the functional runs. The first 5 volumes of each run were discarded to allow for magnetization preparation. A high resolution magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) [TR=2110ms; TE=3.58 ms; matrix=256×256; FOV=256; sagittal plane; voxel size=1×1×1mm; 160 slices] and an in-plane turbo inversion recovery image [TR=2000ms; TE=11; matrix=256×256; FOV=220; voxel size=0.9×0.9×3.4mm, 28 slices] were collected for registration purposes.

All PIB-PET data was pre-processed using SPM8 software 24 . The first 5 frames were summed, and all frames including the summed image were realigned to the middle frame (17 th frame). The subject's structural data was coregistered to their PIB-PET data using the mean image of frames corresponding to the first 20 minutes of acquisition as a target. PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) images were created using Logan graphical analysis with frames corresponding to 35–90 min post-injection and a gray matter (GM) cerebellum reference region defined using FreeSurfer v5.1 software 25 – 27 . Mean DVR values from frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices were computed to serve as a global PIB index for all older subjects.

Elderly subjects were dichotomized into PIB– and PIB+ groups based on a cut-off defined from a group of 18 young subjects who received PIB-PET scans and showed no signs of PIB uptake. Eleven of these subjects were scanned on the ECAT HR and 7 on the Biograph; the mean and standard deviations for the global PIB DVRs were almost identical (Ecat: mean = 1.014, SD = 0.023; Biograph: mean = 0.993, SD = 0.036). These subjects were presumed to be Aβ-free and provide a baseline level of absent PIB binding. Using a method previously reported, the PIB positivity cut-off was taken as 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean PIB Index value of these young subjects (mean = 1.01, SD = 0.03), resulting in a value of 1.07 7 . Experimenters were blinded to subjects' PIB status during data collection.

fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed with the FSL toolbox v5.0 28 . Motion correction was performed with MCFLIRT, aligning all images to the middle slice with rigid body transformation. Slice timing correction was performed using (Hanning windowed) sinc interpolation to shift each slice in the volume in reference to the middle of the TR period. BET (brain extraction tool) was then used to create a mask of the brain from the first volume of each time series and used to separate brain from surrounding skull and tissue in each volume. All images were spatially smoothed with a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to reduce noise. Highpass temporal filtering was performed with a 100s cut-off using the local Gaussian-weighted fit of a running line to remove low frequency artifacts. Subject data were registered to standard space in a three-step process using FNIRT (FMRIB's Non-Linear Image Registration Tool). First, EPIs were linearly registered to each subject's skull-stripped in-plane anatomical image. Second, the in-plane anatomical image was linearly registered to the skull-stripped high resolution T1-weighted image. Third, subject's T1-weighted images were non-linearly registered to standard space (FSL's MNI152 template). The three registrations were then combined to take the subject's EPI images and run-level statistical maps into standard space in one transformation. GM partial volume maps were generated using FSL's FAST tool in order to be included as voxelwise regressors controlling for atrophy. The smoothing of these maps was matched to that of the functional images after registration to standard space.

Individual runs from the encoding session were modeled in subject space using FSL's FEAT v6.0 tool, and resulting statistical maps were registered to standard space for higher level analysis. Separate models were generated for the gist and details tasks. For the gist model, trials were classified as hits or misses. Hits and misses were collapsed across confidence level in order to ensure a sufficient number of events per condition. In the details model, hits and misses were further categorized by the number of details correctly recalled (e.g., Hit_1, Miss_1, Hit_2, Miss_2, etc.). Regressors of interest were obtained by convolving stimulus onset times with FSL's double gamma hemodynamic response function and their temporal derivative. Motion parameters and outlier volumes (defined as excessive motion or intensity) were included as additional confound variables and temporal autocorrelation was removed through pre-whitening. A contrast of hits versus baseline was generated for the gist task to measure relative activations and deactivations for encoded items. A linear contrast was formed in the details model to assess activity parametrically modulated by the number of details encoded. Only trials classified as hits during the gist task were included and detail levels 0–1 and 5–6 were combined to increase the number of events within these conditions. This resulted in linear contrast of [Hit_5+6 > Hit_4 > Hit_3 > Hit_2 > Hit_0+1].

A second level analysis combined these contrasts from the 3 runs for each subject using a one-sample t-test, treating runs as fixed effects. Third-level group statistics maps were created using the Robust Biological Parametric Mapping (rBPM) toolbox 29 , 30 , treating subjects as a random factor. rBPM allows for the inclusion of voxelwise regressors and implements a robust regression model (using the bisquare weight function) to reduce sensitivity to outliers. Performance and GM partial volume maps were included as nuisance regressors, and the average was taken across all three groups. The age effect was assessed by comparing the young and old PIB– groups including GM partial maps and performance (hit rate) as nuisance regressors. The PIB effect was assessed by comparing old PIB+ and old PIB– groups including GM partial volume maps, performance (hit rate) and age as nuisance regressors. Performance was included to account for individual differences on the memory task and to account for varying number of hit trials included in contrasts across subjects. The whole brain family-wise error was cluster corrected to p <0.05 (two-sided) using a cluster forming threshold of p <0.05. Thresholded statistical maps were projected on to inflated atlases for display purposes using Caret v5.64 software 31 . The group comparisons do not distinguish between increased activation and reduced deactivation. Therefore, we examined the relative directionality of significant voxels by masking them with task-positive and task-negative network maps derived from comparing hits to baseline averaged across all groups (i.e., Fig. 1a ). These masked results as well as plots displaying average activity of significant clusters falling within each masked region are presented for visualization purposes.
