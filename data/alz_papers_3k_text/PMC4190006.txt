α-synuclein multimers cluster synaptic-vesicles and attenuate recycling

# Abstract
The normal functions and pathologic facets of the small presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) are of exceptional interest. In previous studies, we found that α-syn attenuates synaptic exo/endocytosis [ 1 , 2 ]; however underlying mechanisms remain unknown. More recent evidence suggests that α-syn exists as metastable multimers and not solely as a natively-unfolded monomer [ 11 - 16 ]. However conformations of α-syn at synapses – its physiologic locale – are unclear; and potential implications of such higher-order conformations to synaptic function is unknown. Exploring α-syn conformations and synaptic function in neurons, we found that α-syn promptly organizes into physiological multimers at synapses. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that α-syn multimers cluster synaptic-vesicles and restrict their motility – suggesting a novel role for these higher-order structures. Supporting this, α-syn mutations that disrupt multimerization also fail to restrict synaptic-vesicle motility or attenuate exo/endocytosis. We propose a model where α-syn multimers cluster synaptic-vesicles, restricting their trafficking and recycling – consequently attenuating neurotransmitter release.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The presynaptic bouton is a central communicating hub, where a sequence of well-orchestrated events leads to exocytosis of neurotransmitter-loaded vesicles into the presynaptic cleft. A variety of presynaptic proteins participate, mainly assisting in the organization and trafficking of synaptic-vesicles. One such protein is α-syn; of singular interest due to its involvement in Parkinson's disease and related movement-disorders/dementias. In previous studies we found that small increments in α-syn-levels lead to suppression of exo/endocytosis [ 1 , 2 ]; and that α-syn restricts the lateral mobility of synaptic-vesicles between en-passant boutons [ 2 ], called “superpool” trafficking [ 3 ]. Along with other studies [ 4 - 9 ], available data advocate the concept that α-syn physiologically attenuates neurotransmitter release; however underlying mechanisms are unclear. α-syn also binds to VAMP2 and promotes SNARE-assembly [ 10 ], but the consequence of these interactions on synaptic physiology is uncertain [ 7 , 10 ]. Regardless, a clear picture of the physiologic role of α-syn has not emerged yet.

As function often follows form in biology, understanding physiologic α-syn conformations is important. Recent studies offer surprising insights, suggesting that α-syn exists as metastable helical multimers, with predominant tetramers [ 11 ]. Though this view has been challenged [ 12 , 13 ], available data from purified brain α-syn show higher-order multimers and mixed helical conformations [ 13 , 14 ], consistent with the idea that α-syn exists as metastable conformers, exchanging between a monomeric and multimeric state. Even so, key questions remain unresolved. What is the conformation of α-syn at synapses , its normal locale? Do α-syn assemblies influence its function? If so how? Here we couple fluorescence-complementation assays – that selectively stabilize putative α-syn assemblies – with various cell-biological paradigms to evaluate vesicle-trafficking and synaptic function.

Though recent studies have demonstrated α-syn multimers [ 11 , 15 , 16 ], most experiments used biochemical or biophysical methods that do not provide spatial information; thus α-syn conformations at the presynapse are not entirely clear. We first evaluated the organization of α-syn at synapses of cultured neurons using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) – an established method to visualize protein-protein interactions [ 17 ]. In this assay, one partner of an interacting-pair is tagged to the N-terminus fragment of the Venus fluorescent protein (VN), while the other partner to the complimentary C-terminus (VC). If and when the two interacting partners associate, the Venus fragments are reconstituted and become fluorescent [see schematic in fig. 1A (i) ]. Reconstitution is irreversible, thus even transient interactions can be “captured” by these methods [ 18 ].

To mitigate concerns related to over-expression, we used a ‘molecular replacement strategy’, where the exogenous protein is expressed in a knockout background, achieving near-physiologic expression-levels [ 19 ]. Specifically, we expressed VN/VC tagged human wild-type α-syn's (VN/VC:α-syn's) in cultured hippocampal neurons (days in vitro-DIV 14) from α-syn null mice and visualized fluorescence after ~14h expression [strategy in fig. 1A(ii) ]. Expression of human α-syn in cultured α-syn null neurons was similar to the expression of native mouse α-syn in parallel-processed cultures (see below). Three different VN/VC-tagged α-syn combinations were used (see methods). In all cases, robust fluorescence was seen at boutons ( fig. 1B -top and Supp. fig. 1A, B ). Co-transfection of VN and VC alone did not show any synaptic fluorescence ( fig. 1B -bottom and data not shown). Complementation was also seen in nonneuronal cells as reported previously [ 20 ], and excess un-tagged α-syn diminished VN/VC:α-syn complementation in HEK cells – presumably by competition – suggesting that complementation was specific for α-syn ( Supp. fig. 1C ). Synaptic fluorescence due to VN/VC:α-syn complementation was widespread, seen in virtually all transfected boutons; overall similar to neurons transfected with Venus:α-syn ( fig. 1B , graph on right). It is unlikely that the complementation in our experiments is an artifact of over-expression, as fluorescence intensities of transfected VN/VC:α-syn boutons in α-syn -/- neurons is similar to endogenous mouse α-syn fluorescence in WT neurons ( fig. 1C, D and also see next).

Next we visualized the time-course of accumulation of newly-synthesized VN/VC:α-syn at boutons. We transfected α-syn null neurons with VN/VC:α-syn (or Venus:α-syn) and visualized the entry of newly-synthesized (somatically-derived) fluorescent molecules into boutons (4-5 hours after transfection), adopting an imaging strategy that we recently developed ([ 21 ], see schematic in fig. 1E ). Figure 1F shows representative images from one such experiment. Note that the kinetics of VN/VC:α-syn entry into boutons is only slightly slower than Venus:α-syn, quantified in figure 1G . These data indicate that multimerization of α-syn is an early event, and likely not a consequence of abnormal long-term intra-molecular associations. Also note that the experimental paradigm (visualizing entry of newly-synthesized proteins into α-syn −/− boutons) further argues that the complementation is unlikely to be a result of over-expression.

Do α-syn multimers have a physiologic role? While qualitatively comparing the synaptic VN/VC:α-syn fluorescence to the fluorescence of endogenous or Venus:α-syn, we noticed that the reconstituted VN/VC:α-syn fluorescence seemingly occupied only a subset of the total bouton-area. To verify this, we used a previously-described protocol to label the entire bouton-profile (using fluorescent actin, see [ 22 ]) and visualized VN/VC:α-syn fluorescence in these boutons. Indeed reconstituted VN/VC:α-syn occupied only a fraction of the bouton-area, as shown in representative bouton-crops ( fig. 2A ). This distribution is unusual, distinct from Venus:α-syn that typically occupies the entire bouton (see Supp. fig. 2A ). We also developed custom algorithms to quantify these data. Briefly, as bouton shapes vary, we measured the cross-sectional area of each bouton along 20 circumferential angles and then calculated its mean “synapse-width” (see fig. 2B for general concept; Supp. fig. 2B and methods for details). Compiled data from these analyses are shown in fig. 2C, D . Note that the VN/VC:α-syn fluorescence only occupies a subset of the bouton cross-sectional area and is indistinguishable from the area occupied by the synaptic-vesicle cluster (labeled with synaptophysin:GFP, fig. 2C ). Furthermore, in neurons co-transfected with VN/VC:α-syn and synaptophysin:mRFP (SyPhy:mRFP), there is a significant overlap of fluorescence (also reflected in correlations between their “synapse-widths”, see fig. 2D ).

Previous studies expressing WT α-syn in yeast revealed a dramatic clustering of vesicles by α-syn [ 23 , 24 ]. Previously, we found that α-syn restricts synaptic-vesicle motility between enpassant boutons [ 2 ], suggesting that α-syn might cluster vesicles within synaptic boutons and restrict vesicle-motility. Since α-syn multimers associate with synaptic-vesicles (above), we asked whether stabilized VN/VC:α-syn multimers facilitate clustering of synaptic-vesicles and inhibit vesicle-motility even further. To test this we designed an assay to directly visualize synaptic-vesicle dispersion; based on previous observations that neuronal activity disperses synaptic-vesicles from boutons into flanking axons [ 25 , 26 ]. Specifically, we asked if stabilized α-syn multimers (reconstituted VN/VC:α-syn's) would attenuate the activity-dependent dispersion of synaptic-vesicles (labeled with SyPhy:mRFP, see fig. 2E ). Indeed while Venus:α-syn alone inhibited this dispersion (as expected), VN/VC:α-syn's attenuated this dispersion even further ( fig. 2F and also see fig. 4C later). Collectively, these experiments suggest that α-syn multimers associate with synaptic-vesicle clusters and restrict their trafficking.

To biochemically evaluate α-syn multimers, we transiently introduced VN/VC:α-syn's into HEK-293 cells or cultured neurons (by adenoviral infections) and analyzed cell-lysates by Native/SDS-PAGE gels ( fig. 3A ). As shown in the native gels ( fig. 3B ), only a few higher-order α-syn bands were typically seen. Though precise molecular weights cannot be determined by these methods, these bands run at ~ 146 kD (α-syn tetramers would be expected to run at ~ 114kD in our system – 4 α-syn's + 2 VFP's). These experiments were repeated several times with similar results, and notably, all three VN/VC combinations showed similar biochemical profiles ( Supp. fig. 3A ).

Though our above data ( fig. 2 ) suggest that α-syn multimers associate with synaptic-vesicles, they do not directly show vesicle-binding. To address this, we evaluated the association of monomeric and multimeric α-syn with purified synaptic-vesicles. Based on previously published protocols [ 27 , 28 ], we incubated α-syn-free synaptic-vesicles and cytosol with purified monomeric or multimeric α-syn (chemically cross-linked, see [ 15 ]; fig. 3C and Supp. fig. 3B ). The main advantage of this assay is that brain cytosolic factors known to affect α-syn binding to membranes are available, recapitulating the in-vivo situation [ 27 ]. As shown in figure 3D , α-syn multimers are indeed capable of binding to synaptic-vesicles, though multimers are also present in cytosolic fractions. Note that these data are in general agreement with Dettmer et al., 2013.

The above data suggest that α-syn multimers associate with and cluster synaptic-vesicles. As α-syn suppresses exo/endocytosis [ 1 , 2 ], one can imagine a scenario where α-syn multimers cluster synaptic-vesicles, thus restricting vesicle-recycling and consequently, neurotransmitter release. If correct, this model predicts that disrupting α-syn multimers would also diminish α-syn-induced vesicle clustering and abrogate α-syn-induced synaptic attenuation. Though molecular determinants of α-syn multimerization are unknown, we reasoned that the most striking feature of the α-syn molecule – N-terminal repeats – might play a role. The N-terminus of α-syn has seven 11-residue repeats that are predicted to fold into amphipathic alpha-helices, highly conserved among species [ 29 - 31 ]. Recent simulation-models also implicate these repeats in α-syn tetramerization [ 32 ]. We used a rationally-designed synthetic mutant, where six threonines (T) – centrally lying along the helical face of the N-terminus – are mutated to lysines (K; known as TsixK, see fig. 4A and [ 33 ]. These mutations are expected to disrupt significant portions of the extended hydrophobic face of the helix, and greatly diminish the helical conformation of α-syn [ 33 ]. Notably, this reduction in helicity occurs despite robust association with vesicles [ 33 ], and indeed both WT and TsixK protein bind synaptic-vesicles with equal affinity in our in-vitro assay ( Supp. fig. 3C ).

Accordingly, we tested the predictions of our model by comparing the ability of WT and TsixK mutants to: 1) organize into multimers, 2) cluster synaptic-vesicles, and 3) influence synaptic-vesicle recycling. First we transfected VN/VC pairs of WT α-syn's (VN/VC:WT) or TsixK α-syn's (VN/VC:TsixK) in cultured neurons from α-syn −/− mice as described previously. As shown in fig. 4B , fluorescence complementation in the VN/VC:TsixK α-syn's was markedly attenuated. Diminution of higher-order conformers was also seen biochemically ( Supp. fig. 3D ). Next we tested the ability of the TsixK mutant to suppress activity-induced synaptic-vesicle dispersion. As shown in fig. 4C , while WT α-syn attenuated synaptic-vesicle dispersion as expected, the TsixK mutant failed to do so. Finally, we asked if TsixK mutations also abrogated the ability of α-syn to attenuate synaptic-vesicle recycling. Towards this we used a pHluorin-based assay that directly reports synaptic-vesicle recycling ([ 34 , 35 ]; see fig. 4D ). While WT-α-syn attenuated recycling as reported previously [ 5 ], TsixK-α-syn only had a mild (non-significant) effect ( fig. 4E, F ).

Collectively, the data support a model where synaptic α-syn is organized into metastable conformers that bind to and cluster synaptic-vesicles, restricting their trafficking. We posit that by influencing synaptic-vesicle trafficking, multimeric α-syn conformers restrict recycling, consequently attenuating neurotransmitter release. Using complementation-assays that stabilize putative protein-protein interactions, we found that near-physiologic levels of α-syn result in robust and widespread complementation at synapses ( fig. 1 ). Given the transient transfection of proteins into an α-syn null background; the resultant low expression-levels (comparable to endogenous-levels, see fig. 1D ); and the paradigms used to visualize initial entry of newly-synthesized α-syn into boutons ( fig. 1E-G ), it is unlikely that the complementation seen in our experiments is a result of over-expression. Moreover, data from three different combinations of VN/VC-fragments (tagged to α-syn's) are similar, untagged α-syn appears to compete with fluorescence complementation in HEK cells, and the TsixK α-syn mutant also fails to complement; collectively arguing that complementation is not due to vagaries of the Venus-fragments, but reflect bona-fide α-syn interactions.

Do α-syn multimers have a physiologic role? Stabilized VN/VC:α-syn multimers were associated with synaptic-vesicles ( fig. 2A-D ), and also inhibited the trafficking of synaptic-vesicles ( fig. 2E, F ; and also fig. 4C ). Our biochemical data also show that α-syn multimers can associate with synaptic vesicles ( fig. 3D ). Notably, the data do not rule out a role for cytosolic α-syn multimers. A recent study showed that purified α-syn protein clusters synthetic vesicles in an in-vitro lipid-binding assay [ 36 ]. Though in isolation, the relevance of these in-vitro findings to neurons and synapses is uncertain; in light of data shown here, the collective evidence advocate the concept that α-syn plays a physiologic role in clustering synaptic-vesicles. Supporting the idea that helical folding of α-syn is important for multimerization, Varkey et al. recently showed that incubation of α-syn with lipid-nanoparticles – known to induce helicity – increases intra-molecular FRET of α-syn [ 37 ]. However, another recent paper suggests that α-syn is exclusively involved in attenuating endocytosis [ 38 ]. Nevertheless, many studies indicate that α-syn influences the exocytic-cycle and SNARE-assemblies, and a more complete dissection of exo- v/s endo-cytosis is warranted. The exact mechanisms by which α-syn multimers restrict vesicle mobility are still unclear. One possibility is that α-syn multimers between adjacent vesicles associate with each other (an “interlocking model”), with perhaps α-syn/VAMP2 interactions also playing a role as suggested by Diao et al. [ 36 ] – an open question for future studies.
