Engineering a memory with LTD and LTP

## Methods
Male Sparague-Dawley rats, age 6–8 weeks for virus injection and cannula placement and 10–12 weeks for behavioral and electrophysiological studies, were housed two per cage and kept on a 12/12 hours light-dark cycle (lights on/off at 7 a.m./7 p.m.). The behavioral studies were done during daylight. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of California, San Diego.

We used a ChR variant, named oChIEF, which is a mammalian codon optimized version of ChIEF 30 with the same properties except that it has stronger expression in mammalian cells and has an additional N-terminal amino acid residue. Expression was driven by the neuron-specifc synapsin promoter 30 .

Male Sparague-Dawley rats, age 6–8 weeks, were anesthetized with isoflurane for stereotaxic injection of AAV-oChIEF into the medial geniculate nucleus (AP: −5.1 mm and −5.7 mm; ML: 2.9 mm; DV: −5.5 to −6.7 mm) and the auditory cortex (AP: −5.7 mm; ML: 4.8 mm with a 20° angle; DV: −4.5 to −5.7 mm). 0.4–0.5 μl of virus was injected over a 10–15 minute period. At the end of injection, pipet remained at the site for 5 minutes to allow for diffusion of the virus. An optic fiber cannula (Doric Lenses) was implanted just above the dorsal tip of the lateral amygdala (AP: −3.3 to −3.5 mm; ML: 4.2 mm; DV: −7 mm with a 7° angle) and secured to the skull with screws and dental cement. Rats were injected with 5mg/kg carprofen (NSAID) after surgery.

Rats, age 6–8 weeks, were anesthetized with isoflurane for stereotaxic injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) into one amygdala ((AP: −3 mm; ML: 4.2 mm; DV: −7 to −8 mm with a 7° angle). 0.5 μl of NMDA (20mg/ml) was injected over a 10–15 minute period 31 . At the end of injection, pipet remained at the site for 5 minutes to allow for diffusion of the solution.

## Behavioral assays
Rats were trained to associate lever press for a reward (40 μl of 10% sucrose per lever press). During the training period rats were kept on a restricted water schedule (2 hours daily of water ad libitum). Training context was a modular operant test chamber (12.5×10×13 in.) with a stainless grid floor and open roof located in a sound attenuating cubicle (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). The test chamber was equipped with a retractable response lever, a liquid dispenser receptacle and a light above the dispenser that signaled when liquid was injected into the dispenser. The consumption of liquid was detected by a head entry detector in the receptacle; each successive liquid reward was subsequently followed with a 15 second delay after head removal from the receptacle. The system was controlled and the data collected through a MED-SYST-16 interface, which was controlled by MED-PCR IV software running on a PC. Rats were initially trained to associate the reward with the light above the dispenser receptacle. In a 45 minute session, rats with at least 60 head entries into the receptacle were selected for lever press training.

Lever-press training was conducted in the same context as above, but this time rats had to press a lever to receive the liquid. The level press turned the light above the receptacle on, which in the previous training session they had associated with liquid in the receptacle. Rats with a minimum of 6 responses/min in the first 10 minute of the training session were selected for conditioning.

The conditioning chamber was a box (12×10.5×13 in.) with an electrified grid floor (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) within a larger sound-attenuating box. Rats had full access to water 24 hours before conditioning. Conditioning protocol consisted of 10 trials of 20 second tone (tone volume 80 dB), with randomized intervals (average interval duration 3 minutes). In the paired group tones were coterminated with a 0.5 second 0.5 mA footshock (or a single 20 second tone coterminated with 1 second 0.5 mA footshock for mild conditioning, Fig. 5 ). In unpaired group tones and shocks were separated by at least 1 min. Paired and unpaired groups received equal number of tones (CS) and shocks (US) in the same context; however, only in the paired group did tone and shock coincide. Next day conditioned rats were placed into the test chamber to measure the effect of CS on their lever presses (for details, see the section for Testing).

Rats were placed into the conditioning chamber and were attached to an optic fiber patch cord connected to a 473 nm solid-state laser diode (OEM Laser Systems) with 15–20 mW of output from the 200 μm fiber. They were allowed to explore the chamber for 3 min prior to the conditioning. Optical conditioning was 10-trains of blue light (10 pulses of 10 Hz, 2 ms duration) applied at randomized intervals with an average of 3 minutes apart. For paired conditioning, the light stimulus co-terminated with 0.5 s of 0.5 mA footshock; in unpaired conditioning, the light and shock were separated by a minimum of 1 min. Paired and unpaired groups received equal number of light stimuli and shocks in the same context; however, only in the paired group did light and shock coincide. The delivery of shock and light was controlled by a pulse generator (Master-8; AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel). After the conditioning rats remained in the box for additional three minutes before returning to their home cage.

After the conditioning, rats were water restricted for 24 hours before they were tested for lever press. Testing was done in the same context as training except that the floor was a plastic sheet with white and red strips. Testing was a 7 minute session in which rats had to press a lever to receive the liquid (10% sucrose). Rats were attached to the optic fiber patch cord, placed into the chamber, and allowed to explore the environment for 5 minutes before having access to the lever. The testing session, where rats had free access to the lever, was a 3 minute period of no light, followed by two minutes of light on (10 Hz of pulses with 2 ms duration), and two minutes of no light. At the end of the session rats were returned to their home cage. Only rats that in two consecutive days showed consistent reduction (>30%) in the lever press during the light-on period were used for further behavioral phases. Those which failed the test were examined histologically to locate the position of cannula and viral injection ( Extended Data Fig. 4 ).

Tone-conditioned rats were tested in the same way except that they received 2 minutes of tone instead of light stimulation.

Within one hour following testing, rats were placed in a separate context, a translucent plastic container (22.5×15×12 in.), attached to the optic fiber patch cord and allowed to explore the environment for 3 minutes before LTD induction. Optical LTD was induced with 900 pulses of light, each 2 ms, at 1 Hz. After the induction rats remained in the chamber for 3 additional minutes before returning to their home cage.

Within one hour following testing, rats were placed in a separate context, a cardboard box (20.5×15.5×14.5 in.), attached to the optic fiber patch cord and allowed to explore the environment for 3 minutes before LTP induction. Optical LTP was induced with 5 trains of light (each train 100 pulses, 100 Hz) at 3 minute inter-train intervals. After the induction rats remained in the chamber for 3 additional minutes before returning to their home cage. During all behavioral assays the light intensity remained the same for each animal. At the end of the experiment, animals were perfused and the location of the optic fiber was verified.

Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane for 5 minutes before being given an intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (0.2 mg/kg) in sterile saline. Conditioning protocol was administered 30 minutes following injection.

Prior to perfusion, rats were administered a ketamine/dexdomitor (75 and 5 mg/kg respectively) mixture intraperitoneal injection . Rats were then transcardially perfused with ~150 mL of saline followed by ~150 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer solution (PB, pH 7.4). Brains were then fixed overnight in the same solution and rinsed and stored in 0.1M PB for slicing.

Brains were sliced coronally in 150 μm sections using a vibratome sectioning system and stored in PB. Slices were imaged using an Olympus MVX10 epifluorescent microscope to verify AAV-oChIEF-tdTomato expression in the MGN, auditory cortex, and their projections to the dorsal lateral amygdala. Additionally, appropriate positioning of the optic fiber cannula over the lateral amygdala was verified.

For extracellular field potential recordings acute slices (as described in 33 ) were prepared from 3–4 month old rats expressing AAV-oChIEF in the medial geniculate nucleus /and or auditory cortex. Extracellular field potentials were recorded with Axopatch-1D amplifiers (Axon Instruments) in dorsal tip of the lateral amygdala with glass electrodes (1–2 MΩ) filled with the perfusion solution. The auditory projection to the lateral amygdala was evoked by optical stimulation above the recording site. To measure AMPA-R field potential 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) (10 μM) was added at the end of the experiments. Data were acquired and analyzed using custom software written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Perfusion solution contained: 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM glucose (pH 7.4), and gassed with 5% CO2/ 95% O2.

For whole cell recording, acute slices (as described in 34 – 36 ) were prepared from 3–4 month old rats expressing AAV-oChIEF in the medial geniculate nucleus and/or auditory cortex. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from individual cells in dorsal tip of the lateral amygdala using glass pipettes (3–4 MΩ) filled with internal solution containing, in mM, cesium methanesulfonate 115, CsCl 20, HEPES 10, MgCl 2 2.5, Na 2 ATP 4, Na 3 GTP 0.4, sodium phosphocreatine 10, and EGTA 0.6, at pH 7.25. External perfusion consisted of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM glucose, supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM CaCl 2 , 100 μM picrotoxin and 1 mM Sodium L-ascorbate. Synaptic responses were evoked every 10 second by stimulating auditory projections to the lateral amygdala using 2 ms of blue light generated by the epifluorescence microscope and passed through the 60X objective lenses placed immediately above the recorded cell. AMPA:NMDA ratio was calculated as the ratio of peak current at −60mV to the current at +40mV, 50 ms after stimulus; both values subtracted from the current at 0mV.

Four weeks after injection of AAV-oChIEF-tdTomato into auditory regions (8 animals were injected in both MGN and auditory cortex; 2 animals were injected in only auditory cortex; results were pooled), rats were anesthetized with a set of three injections of 700 μl urethane (330 mg/ml) given at 10 minute intervals 2 hours before the recording 37 and then mounted on a custom made stereotaxic frame with an adjustable angle, to hold the head in a fixed position during the recording. The body temperature was regulated by a heating pad. Using aseptic surgical tools the skull was exposed and a hole (~3 mm) was made, centered at −3.3mm AP and 4.2mm ML. The recording electrode was a glass pipet (4–5mΩ) filled with 0.9% NaCl. The recording electrode was connected to a Axopatch-1D amplifier. The signal was amplified (X1000), filtered (2K Hz) and digitized at 10 kHz using an Instrutech A/D interface. Data were acquired and analyzed using custom software written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).

For optical stimulation, the optic fiber was glued to the glass pipet so that the tip of the fiber was 500 μm above the tip of the glass pipet to form an optrode. The optic fiber was connected to a 473 nm solid-state laser diode (OEM Laser Systems). The parameters for the optical stimulation were identical to those used during behavior (2 ms duration, 15–20 mW intensity). The optrode was slowly lowered in at a 7° angle following the start of stimulation. After establishing a stable baseline of at least 30 minutes (stimulation frequency 0.033Hz) at the recording site (DV: −7 to −7.5), 2 minutes of 10 Hz stimulation was evoked, which was followed by 40 minutes of 0.033 Hz stimulation. Subsequent LTD and LTP, with the same parameters used in the behavioral assay, were induced 40 minutes apart. Electrode resistance and light intensity were monitored before and immediately after the recordings to ensure that there was no change in the course of recording. All animals were perfused after the recordings and the position of the recording site verified.

The number of lever presses were binned for each minute and normalized to the two minute period before light stimulation. Suppression ratio was measured by dividing the number of lever press during the first minute of conditioning stimulus (tone or optical stimulation) by that immediately preceding the stimulus.

To minimize the voltage dependent conductance component the initial slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials 13 were measured using a custom written MatLab program.

Excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude was measured by averaging a fixed 3-ms window covering the peak amplitude and subtracting from an average current window before stimulation. All values given in the text and figures indicate mean ± SEM. Student’s paired and non-paired t-tests were used with p < 0.05 considered as significant. All behavioral data were also analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Matlab statistic toolbox) and yielded the same significance values as the t-test.

## Extended Data
Plot of percent freezing versus percent reduction in lever presses to previously learned task. Best fit line indicates significant positive correlation (R 2 = 0.4; p < 0.01; F-test). Data includes results from 3 manipulations (paired optical CS-shock conditioning, optical LTD and optical LTP). The percent change in lever presses to previously learned task (60% ± 9%) was significantly greater than change in percent freezing (20% ± 5%; N = 21; p < 0.001, paired Students t-test)
