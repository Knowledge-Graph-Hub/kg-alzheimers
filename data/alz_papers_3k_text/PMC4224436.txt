Young blood reverses age-related impairments in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in mice

# Abstract
As human lifespan increases, a greater fraction of the population is suffering from age-related cognitive impairments, making it important to elucidate a means to combat the effects of aging 1 , 2 . Here we report that exposure of an aged animal to young blood can counteract and reverse pre-existing effects of brain aging at the molecular, structural, functional and cognitive level. Genome-wide microarray analysis of heterochronic parabionts—in which circulatory systems of young and aged animals are connected—identified synaptic plasticity–related transcriptional changes in the hippocampus of aged mice. Dendritic spine density of mature neurons increased and synaptic plasticity improved in the hippocampus of aged heterochronic parabionts. At the cognitive level, systemic administration of young blood plasma into aged mice improved age-related cognitive impairments in both contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Structural and cognitive enhancements elicited by exposure to young blood are mediated, in part, by activation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (Creb) in the aged hippocampus. Our data indicate that exposure of aged mice to young blood late in life is capable of rejuvenating synaptic plasticity and improving cognitive function.

## ONLINE METHODS
Every effort was put forth into ensuring that multiple investigators were able to reproduce the basic findings at both the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and Stanford/VA Palo Alto using different facilities, instruments and tools. For behavioral experiments, efforts were made to equate testing protocols between institutions, but a number of environmental factors differing between institutions persisted. Such confounding factors could directly result in the differences observed between the two institutions in animal baseline freezing and errors committed. In particular, the investigators, animal husbandry methods, type of animal chow provided, vivarium noise levels and overall behavior room dimensions and layouts differed between the institutions. Additionally, plasma denaturation and K-Creb cognitive experiments were conducted over 2 years after the first plasma–treatment cognitive experiments.

The following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6 young mice (The Jackson Laboratory) and C57BL/6 young and aged mice (National Institutes of Aging). All studies were done in male mice. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences were calculated using standard power calculations with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool ( http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html ) to calculate power and sample sizes based on experience with the respective tests, the variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle, and all animal handling and use was in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the VA Palo Alto Committee on Animal Research.

Parabiosis surgery followed previously described procedures 12 , 14 . Mirror-image incisions at the left and right flanks were made through the skin, and shorter incisions were made through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal openings of the adjacent parabionts were sutured together. Elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together, and the skin of each mouse was stapled (9-mm Autoclip, Clay Adams) to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with enrofloxacin (Bayer) antibiotic and buprenorphine (Butler Schein) as directed for pain and monitored during recovery. For overall health and maintenance behavior, several recovery characteristics were analyzed at various times after surgery, including paired weights, grooming and stress responses. General appearance was recorded at the indicated intervals using a basic grooming appearance scale that ranged from an absence of grooming behavior (0) to normal, healthy grooming behavior (4). Intermediate scores reflect the degree and frequency at which fur was groomed and/or maintained on various regions of the paired body, including muzzle, eyes, head, torso and legs, adapted from guidelines from Smolinsky et al. , 2009 (refs. 28 , 29 ).

Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (Patterson Veterinary) (2 l per min oxygen flow rate) delivered through an anesthesia nose cone. Ophthalmic eye ointment was applied to the cornea to prevent desiccation during surgery. The area around the incision was trimmed. Viral solutions were injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampi using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −2 mm, lateral = 1.5 mm and (from skull surface) height = −2.1 mm. A 2 μl volume was injected stereotaxically over 10 min (injection speed: 0.20 μl per min) using a 5-μl 26s-gauge Hamilton syringe. To limit reflux along the injection track, the needle was maintained in situ for 8 min, slowly pulled out half-way and kept in position for an additional 2 min. The skin was closed using silk suture. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with the analgesic buprenorphine (Butler Schein). Mice were single housed and monitored during recovery.

Hippocampi from isochronic and heterochronic parabionts were dissected, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA and cRNA were sequentially synthesized and amplified using an RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cRNA was then hybridized to the Illumina beadchip array MouseWG-6 v2.0 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were analyzed by Illumina beadstudio data analysis software (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Cluster 3.0 software was used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of z -scored data sets. Java TreeView software was used for generating heat maps. A cutoff at P < 0.01 and absolute d score > 2 or d score > 1.5 was used based on SAM software (SAM 3.00 algorithm, http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/ was applied for the data set analysis). Significantly changed probe sets were analyzed for statistically enriched pathways using IPA (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com ) and categorized for biological function using AmiGO (The Gene Ontology Consortium, http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go/cgi ).

Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry were performed on free-floating sections following standard published techniques 30 . Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, and brains were removed and fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h before cryprotection with 30% sucrose. Free-floating coronal sections (40 μm) were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Egr1 (1:500, 588, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti–c-Fos (1:500, 4-17, Millipore) or rabbit anti-pCreb (1:1,000, Ser133, 06-519, Millipore) primary antibodies, and staining was revealed using biotinylated secondary antibodies and the ABC kit (Vector) with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich). Individual cell numbers were quantified by Egr1 and c-Fos, and pCreb was quantified as the mean signal intensity using NIH ImageJ software.

After brain removal, hemispheres were immersed in 10 ml modified Golgi-Cox staining solution (courtesy of D. Jing and F. Lee at Cornell University) for 7–10 d at room temperature in the dark. Brains were transferred to 30% sucrose in dH 2 O at 4 °C for 72 h. Sections (150 μm) were mounted onto slides coated with 0.3% gelatin in dH 2 O. After briefly drying, slides were dipped in 40% sucrose three times and air dried for 72 h in the dark. Slides were immersed into dH 2 O three times for 10 min with gentle shaking and then transferred to a developing solution for 6 min. Slides were then rinsed three times for 10 min in dH 2 O, dehydrated through graded ethanol, immersed in Histoclear and then coverslipped using DPX mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were traced at 100×, and all subsequent analyses were done using Neurolucida Software (v10, MBF Bioscience). Sholl analysis was performed for each neuron by placing concentric spheres at 10-μm intervals from the soma. The number of times the dendrite intersected each sphere and the total dendritic length within each sphere were quantified. Dendritic length was summed across distance in the x , y , and z planes and across multiple dendritic branches of the neurons that are contained within each radius.

Extracellular electrophysiology was performed as previously described 31 . Acute hippocampal slices (400-μm thick) were prepared from aged parabionts. Slices were maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; (in mM) NaCl, 124.0; KCl, 2.5; KH 2 PO4, 1.2; CaCl 2 , 2.4; MgSO 4 , 1.3; NaHCO 3 , 26.0; and glucose, 10.0) continuously oxygenated with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 . Recordings were performed with an Axopatch-2B amplifier and pClamp 10.2 software (Axon Instruments). Submerged slices were continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of 2 ml per min from a reservoir by gravity feeding. Field potential (population spikes) was recorded using glass microelectrodes filled with ACSF (resistance: 4–8 MΩ). Biphasic current pulses (0.2-ms duration for one phase, 0.4 ms in total) were delivered in 10-s intervals through a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, Inc.). No obvious synaptic depression or facilitation was observed with this frequency stimulation. To record field population spikes in the dentate gyrus, the recording electrode was placed in the lateral or medial side of the dorsal part of the dentate gyrus. The stimulating electrode was placed directly above the hippocampal fissure to stimulate the perforant pathway fibers. Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Tetanic stimulation consisted of two trains of 100 pulses (0.4-ms pulse duration, 100 Hz) delivered with an intertrain interval of 5 s. The amplitude of each population spike was measured from the initial phase of the negative wave. Up to five consecutive traces were averaged for each measurement. Synaptic transmission was assessed by generating input-output curves, with the stimulus strength adjusted to be ~30% of the maximum. LTP was calculated as the mean percentage change in the amplitude of the population spike after high-frequency stimulation relative to its basal amplitude.

Mouse hippocampi were dissected after perfusion of the animal, snap frozen and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (500 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS and cOmplete protease inhibitors; Roche). Tissue lysates were mixed with 4× NuPage LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen), loaded on a 4–12% SDS polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) and incubated with rabbit anti-actin (1:5,000, A-5060, Sigma), mouse anti-Gapdh (1:10,000, 6C5, Abcam) rabbit anti-Creb (1:1,000, 48H2, Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-pCreb (1:1,000, Ser133, D1G6, Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL kit (GE Healthcare/Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to detect protein signals. Multiple exposures were taken to select images within the dynamic range of the film (GE Healthcare Amersham Hyperfilm ECL). Selected films were scanned (300 dots per inch) and quantified using ImageJ software (Version 1.46k). Actin bands were used for normalization.

We generated AAVs (AAV-DJ 32 ) that overexpressed a DNA binding–incompetent form of Creb (K-Creb), which have been previously shown to exhibit dominant-negative inhibition of endogenous Creb signaling (Clontech) 24 . The AAV plasmids expressed a K-Creb–T2A-GFP construct under a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The K-Creb sequence was isolated using the Phusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase (Fisher Scientific, Inc) using the following PCR primers: 5′-ATATATGCTAGCGCCACCATGACCATG GAATCTGGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATATATGGATCCATCTGATTTGTGGCAGT AAAGGTC-3′. K-Creb was then cloned into the AAV backbone using the restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI. The K-Creb construct is in frame with both the T2A domain and GFP. We generated lentiviruses (LVs) encoding shRNAs targeting endogenous Creb using a lentiviral shRNA expression system (pGreenPuro shRNA, System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Creb-targeted sequences were cloned into the pGreen-Puro vector (Creb, 5′-GTACAGCTGGCTAACAATGG-3′). Plasmid quality was tested with western blot analysis and sequencing. AAVs and LVs were stereotaxically injected into one hippocampus, and a control virus, based on the same viral plasmid, was injected as an internal control at the same location into the contralateral hemisphere.

LV vectors were generated at the UCSF Viracore, and AAV vectors were generated at the Stanford Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core. We used AAV-DJ 32 to efficiently infect neurons over a wide area of the hippocampus 33 . Viral titers were between 5 × 10 8 and 1.2 × 10 9 viral particles per ml.

An N2A neuronal cell line (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-131) was used for in vitro experiments. Cells were plated at a confluency of 85–90% for transfection experiments. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as the transfection reagent. The culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) was exchanged after 6 h to reduce toxicity caused by the transfection reagent. Gene expression was assessed with the help of GFP reporters and fluorescence microscopy. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection. Experiments were performed in triplicates. For transcriptional activity analysis of Creb, luciferase reporter plasmids (Signosis) were co-transfected with either Creb or K-Creb plasmids into N2A cells. The Luciferase reporter assay was used following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).

Our paradigm followed previously published techniques 34 . Mice learned to associate the environmental context (fear-conditioning chamber) with an aversive stimulus (mild foot shock; unconditioned stimulus, US), which enabled testing for hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning. The mild foot shock was paired with a light and tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) in order to also assess amygdaladependent cued fear conditioning. Conditioned fear was displayed as freezing behavior. Specific training parameters were as follows: tone duration, 30 s; level, 70 dB, 2 kHz; shock duration, 2 s; intensity, 0.6 mA. On day 1, each mouse was placed in a fear-conditioning chamber and allowed to explore for 2 min before delivery of a 30-s tone (70 dB) ending with a 2-s foot shock (0.6 mA). Two minutes later, a second CS-US pair was delivered. On day 2, each mouse was first placed in the fear-conditioning chamber containing the same exact context but with no administration of a CS or foot shock. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 min. One hour later, the mice were placed in a new context containing a different odor, cleaning solution, floor texture, chamber walls and shape. Animals were allowed to explore for 2 min before being re-exposed to the CS. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 min. Freezing was measured using a FreezeScan video tracking system and software (Cleversys, Inc).

Our paradigm followed a previously described protocol 35 . The goal arm location containing a platform remained constant throughout the training and testing phases, and the start arm was changed during each trial. On day 1 during the training phase, mice were trained for 15 trials, with trials alternating between a visible and a hidden platform. On day 2 during the testing phase, mice were tested for 15 trials with a hidden platform. Entry into an incorrect arm was scored as an error, and errors were averaged over the training blocks (three consecutive trials).

Pooled mouse plasma was collected from 700 young (3 months) or aged (18 months) mice by intracardial bleed at time of euthanasia. Plasma was prepared from blood collected with EDTA followed by centrifugation at 1,000 g . For plasma denaturation, plasma was heated for 2–3 min at 95 °C, followed by a short spin at 1,000 g . All plasma aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. Before administration, plasma was dialyzed using 3.5-kDa D-tube dialyzers (EMD Millipore) in PBS to remove EDTA. Young adult mice were systemically treated with plasma (100 μl per injection) isolated from young or aged mice by intraorbital injections or intravenously into the tail vein eight times over 24 d.

Blood was obtained from each mouse in a pair by serial submandibular bleeding under rapid isoflurane exposure; the sampling site on the muzzle was alternated for each time point to minimize discomfort. Plasma was isolated and stored at −80 °C until measurement of the stress-response hormone corticosterone (CORT) by a competitive CORT ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences). Urine was obtained by placing each pair on a wire-cage hopper and palpating the bladder to void urine into individual Eppendorf tubes for each mouse of the pair. Samples for all time points were collected according to a strict schedule to minimize circadian fluctuations in blood hormone concentrations. Urine CORT was measured according to manufacturer recommendations using the CORT ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Raw absorbance values for all CORT ELISAs were obtained from a microtiter plate reader at an absorbance of 405 nm. CORT concentrations of test samples were calculated from a four-parameter logistic curve fit of the percentage steroid bound versus the [CORT] of the standards.

All experiments were randomized and performed by a blinded independent researcher. Researchers remained blinded throughout histological, biochemical and behavioral assessments. Groups were unblinded at the end of each experiment before statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. The distribution of the data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test or the Shapiro-Wilk test. No significant differences in variance between groups were detected using an F test. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared with a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. Comparisons of means from multiple groups with each other or against one control group were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by the appropriate post-hoc tests (as indicated in the figure legends). All histology, electrophysiology and behavior experiments were conducted in a randomized and blinded fashion.
