APOE,MAPT,SNCA, and Cognitive Performance in Parkinson Disease

# Abstract
Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common and disabling problem in Parkinson’s disease (PD) that is not well understood and is difficult to treat. Identification of genetic variants that influence the rate of cognitive decline or pattern of early cognitive deficits in PD might provide a clearer understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this important non-motor feature. To determine if common variation in the APOE , MAPT , and SNCA genes is associated with cognitive performance in patients with PD. We studied 1,079 PD patients from six academic centers in the U.S. who underwent assessments of memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R]), attention/executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing and Trail Making Test), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency), visuospatial skills (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation) and global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]). Subjects were genotyped for APOE ε2/ε3/ε4, MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes, and SNCA rs356219. Linear regression was used to test for association between genotype and baseline cognitive performance adjusting for age, sex, years of education, disease duration, and site. We used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the nine comparisons that were performed for each gene. Nine variables derived from seven psychometric tests. APOE ε4 was associated with lower performance on HVLT-R total learning ( P =6.7×10 −6 ; corrected P [ P c ]=6.0×10 −5 ), delayed recall ( P =0.001; P c =0.009), and recognition discrimination index ( P =0.004; P c =0.04), and semantic verbal fluency ( P =0.002; P c =0.018), Letter-Number sequencing ( P =1 × 10 −5 ; P c =9 × 10 −5 ), and Trails B-A ( P =0.002; P c =0.018). In a subset of 645 non-demented patients, APOE ε4 was associated with lower scores on HVLT-R total learning ( P =0.005; P c =0.045) and semantic verbal fluency ( P =0.005; P c =0.045). MAPT and SNCA variants were not associated with scores on any tests. Our data indicate that APOE ε4 is an important predictor of cognitive function in PD across multiple domains. Among non-demented PD patients, APOE ε4 was only associated with lower performance on word list learning and semantic verbal fluency, a pattern more typical of the cognitive deficits seen in early Alzheimer’s disease than PD.

## INTRODUCTION
Cognitive impairment (CI) commonly occurs in Parkinson disease (PD) and has a major impact on quality of life, caregiver distress, the need for nursing home placement, and mortality. 1 - 4 At the time of diagnosis 19-24% of PD patients have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 5 , 6 and up to 80% develop dementia (PDD) during the course of the disease. 7 , 8 The rate of cognitive decline and pattern of early cognitive deficits in PD are highly variable for reasons that are not well understood. 9 , 10 Identification of biological markers, including common genetic variants, that account for this heterogeneity could provide important insights into the pathological processes that underlie CI in PD.

Few genetic studies have been conducted in this area and most have focused on the endpoint of dementia. Available evidence suggests that at least three genes, APOE , MAPT , and SNCA , might play a role in determining susceptibility to CI in PD. The APOE ε4 allele is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 11 and is also associated with slightly reduced cognition in healthy older adults. 12 , 13 APOE ε4 was found to predict earlier onset of dementia or more rapid cognitive decline in patients with PD in some studies 14 , 15 but not others. 16 , 17 The MAPT H1 haplotype is a well-known risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders including PD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. 18 , 19 Two studies found that the MAPT H1 haplotype is a risk factor for dementia in PD 20 , 21 but these findings require further replication. Finally, rare multiplications of the SNCA gene result in PD, often accompanied by early-onset dementia. 22 Common SNCA polymorphisms also convey risk for PD 23 but whether these same variants predispose patients with PD to develop CI early in their clinical course is not known.

In this study we examined the association between common variation in APOE , MAPT , and SNCA and cognitive performance in a large, multi-center sample of patients with PD.

## METHODS
The initial study population was 1,191 patients with PD enrolled in studies at Emory University, the University of Cincinnati, and the Pacific Northwest, University of Pennsylvania, and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson’s Disease Research. The Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC) is comprised of two sites, one in Seattle, WA (University of Washington/VA Puget Sound Health Care System) and one in Portland, OR (Oregon Health and Science University/Portland VA Medical Center). All subjects met United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for PD, except those from UCLA who satisfied clinical diagnostic criteria for PD as described elsewhere. 24 Requirements to meet the latter criteria include: (1) presence of at least two of the following signs: bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, (2) no suggestion of a cause for another parkinsonian syndrome, and (3) no atypical features. Each subject underwent a detailed neuropsychological assessment (performed in the “on” state if medicated) and seven tests that overlapped between sites were chosen as the “core battery” (defined in the following section). Thirty-seven participants completed less than half of the tests in the core battery and were excluded from the sample. To reduce genetic heterogeneity all participants were genotyped for a panel of ancestry informative markers designed to estimate admixture proportions from four ancestral populations: Europeans, East Asians, Africans, and Amerindians (unpublished results). Seventy-five subjects estimated to have <90% European ancestry were excluded. The final study population was comprised of 1,079 subjects.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents were obtained. All study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at each participating site.

All study participants underwent psychometric testing under the supervision of a neurologist or psychiatrist (University of Pennsylvania), or a neuropsychologist (all other sites) experienced in the assessment of patients with PD. Seven tests that were administered by at least five of the six sites were defined as the core battery: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Letter-Number Sequencing, Trail Making Test (Trails), semantic verbal fluency (animals), phonemic verbal fluency (FAS), and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (JoLO) ( Table 1 ). Data from subjects enrolled at PANUC-Seattle, PANUC-Portland, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Pennsylvania Udall Center were reviewed at a diagnostic consensus conference, and subjects were classified as demented or non-demented as previously described. 25 , 26 The non-demented group included subjects with either no CI or mild CI. Note that scores on tests with less overlap between sites that were not included in the core battery, such as Logical Memory, Boston Naming, Digit Span, and Digit Symbol, were used in determining cognitive diagnosis when available.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard methods. All subjects were genotyped for 29 ancestry informative markers and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of interest: APOE rs429358 and rs7412 (which define the ε2, ε3 and ε4 alleles), MAPT rs1800547 (which differentiates the H1 and H2 haplotypes), and SNCA rs356219. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan assays on the Fluidigm BioMark HD System. The genotyping success rate was 100% for MAPT and SNCA , and > 99% for APOE .

We assessed each SNP for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using an exact test. We selected ( a priori ) nine variables for analysis from the core battery that represent the primary measures most commonly used in a clinical setting for each test: total scores for MoCA, Letter-Number Sequencing, Trails B-A, semantic and phonemic verbal fluency, JoLO, HVLT-R total learning, HVLT-R delayed recall, and HVLT-R recognition discrimination index (calculated as true positive score minus false positive score). The association between genotype and cognitive performance was tested using linear regression under an additive genetic model adjusting for sex, years of education, disease duration, age at testing, and site. Disease duration was calculated as the difference between age at testing and age at diagnosis. Separately for association tests involving APOE , MAPT , and SNCA , we used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the nine comparisons that were performed. We used a Pearson χ 2 test to compare categorical subject characteristics across sites and genotypes and to compare genotypes across sites. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare continuous subject characteristics across sites and genotypes. All analyses were performed using Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

## RESULTS
There were small but significant differences in all of the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study participants across sites ( Table 2 ). For example, at UCLA, the mean age at testing and mean age at diagnosis were higher, and the mean years of education lower, than for most of the other sites. There was a predominance of males at each site, which was particularly marked at the PANUC Portland site (92.2%).

None of the SNPs deviated significantly from HWE. There were no significant differences in population characteristics across genotypes ( eTable 1 ) or in genotype frequencies across sites ( eTable 2 ).

The APOE ε4 allele was associated with lower performance on six of the nine psychometric variables after correction for multiple testing: HVLT-R total learning (corrected P [ P c ]=6.0×10 −5 ), delayed recall ( P c =0.009), and recognition discrimination index ( P c =0.04), and semantic verbal fluency ( P c =0.018), Letter-Number sequencing ( P c =9 × 10 −5 ), and Trails B-A ( P c =0.018) ( Table 3 ). Box plots of the data by APOE genotype for the six significant variables are presented in the eFigure . However, there was no significant association between either the MAPT H1 haplotype or SNCA rs356219 and any of the psychometric tests ( P >0.05; Table 3 ). For psychometric variables that deviated from normality when examining histograms and quantile-quantile plots (MoCA, Trails B-A, JoLO, HVLT-R recognition discrimination index), results of the aforementioned association analysis were similar when applying data transformations to better achieve a normal distribution (data not shown).

To allow comparison between the effects of APOE and the clinical and demographic covariates included in the regression models, beta coefficients for each of these variables are presented in eTable 3 . For example, there was an expected decrease of 1.55 words in mean HVLT-R total learning for each additional copy of the APOE ε4 allele. The effect of one APOE ε4 allele on HVLT-R total learning was equivalent to the effect of 3.5 (i.e., Beta APOE /BetaEDUCATION= -1.55/.44) fewer years of education or an increase in age at testing of 6.0 (i.e., Beta APOE /BetaAGE AT TESTING= -1.55/-.26) years given the same values for all other covariates.

In order to assess the effects of APOE on cognition in PD prior to the onset of dementia, we then analyzed the ε4 allele in the subset of patients who had received a cognitive diagnosis via consensus diagnosis conference (n = 775). As in the full sample, APOE ε4 predicted lower performance in nearly all tests prior to adjustment for multiple comparisons ( Table 4 ). After Bonferroni correction, HVLT-R total learning ( P =2 × 10 −4 ; P c =0.0018) and semantic verbal fluency ( P =0.002; P c =0.02) remained significant, and Letter-Number Sequencing ( P =0.009; P c =0.081) and MoCA ( P =0.01; P c =0.09) approached significance. When patients with a diagnosis of dementia (n=130) were removed and the data reanalyzed, the only associations that remained significant were HVLT-R total learning ( P =0.005; P c =0.045) and semantic verbal fluency ( P =0.005; P c =0.045).

## DISCUSSION
In a multicenter cohort of patients with PD, the APOE ε4 allele predicted lower performance across multiple cognitive domains including memory, attention/executive function, and language processing. In non-demented patients the effect of the ε4 allele was restricted to HVLT-R total learning and semantic verbal fluency. In contrast, the MAPT H1 haplotype and SNCA rs356219 were not correlated with scores on any of the psychometric tests.

APOE ε4 is a well-known risk factor for AD. In pre-clinical and early AD deficits in episodic memory predominate. However, impairment in semantic fluency, with relative sparing of phonemic fluency, also occurs. 27 , 28 This observation is attributed to the fact that temporal cortex, one of the first brain regions affected in AD, 29 , 30 plays a larger role in mediating semantic than phonemic verbal fluency. 31 In contrast, early cognitive deficits in PD usually involve attention and frontal-executive function mediated in part by cortical-striatal dopamine deficiency, though some patients do initially exhibit isolated deficits in other domains. 6 , 32 We observed that in non-demented PD patients APOE ε4 was only associated with poorer performance on word list learning and semantic verbal fluency ( Table 4 ), a pattern more typical of the cognitive deficits seen in early AD than PD. Thus, individuals with PD who carry the ε4 allele might be particularly vulnerable to early semantic memory impairment, and this might in part explain the heterogeneity in cognitive profiles reported in PD patients with MCI. 10 , 33 In AD, APOE ε4 is thought to influence disease risk by accelerating the accumulation of neurotoxicamyloid-β (Aβ) which ultimately leads to neurodegeneration with accompanying “AD neuropathologic changes” (i.e. neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Whether the neuropathologic substrate of CI in PD patients who carry APOE ε4 consistently involves an increased burden of AD neuropathologic changes is not clear. However, APOE genotype was not correlated with measures of AD pathology in a recent PD autopsy series 34 or with brain amyloid burden in PD patients imaged with Pittsburgh compound B. 35 Thus, it is possible that APOE might affect cognition in PD through mechanisms unrelated to Aβ processing.

Previous studies of the effect of APOE on CI in PD have yielded mixed results, and the interpretation of these data is complicated by the wide variety of study designs and cognitive measures employed. In an incident cohort of 107 PD patients from the U.K. assessed longitudinally over five years APOE ε4 was not associated with risk of dementia or rate of cognitive decline. 16 Similarly, a population-based study of 64 Norwegian PD patients followed for 12 years found no association between the ε4 allele and development of dementia or time to dementia. 17 However, a subsequent longitudinal study of 212 PD patients from the U.S. reported that ε4 carriers displayed a more rapid decline in total score on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale than non-carriers. 15 A meta-analysis of 17 cross-sectional studies published in 2009 reported a significantly higher APOE ε4 frequency in PDD patients (n = 501) in comparison to non-demented PD patients (n = 1145; odds ratio [OR] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.23), though the authors cautioned that small sample sizes, heterogeneity of ORs, and publication bias might have confounded their results. 16 In more recent cross-sectional studies of 879 PD cases from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Neurogenetics repository, 36 and 234 PD patients from South Korea, 37 ε4 carrier status was not associated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, in an autopsy-based study in which subjects with substantial concomitant AD neuropathologic changes were excluded, APOE ε4 was overrepresented in patients with PDD (n = 81) in comparison to cognitively intact controls (n = 269; OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.6). 38 One explanation for these seemingly discordant results is that many prior studies had small sample sizes or used insensitive measures of cognition in PD (e.g. the MMSE 39 ), and thus might have lacked adequate power. In contrast, our study included a large sample and used a more extensive psychometric battery to assess cognition. Furthermore, we analyzed cognitive performance using quantitative data which is a more powerful approach than using categorical variables (e.g. demented vs. non-demented).

In evaluating the role of APOE ε4 in cognition in diseases other than AD one must consider whether the effects observed differ from the “background” effect of APOE in the general population. For example, a meta-analysis of 77 studies consisting of 40,942 cognitively intact individuals (11,108 ε4 carriers and 29,834 ε4 non-carriers) found that APOE ε4 had a small but significant negative effect on measures of global cognitive functioning ( P < 0.05), episodic memory ( P < 0.01), executive function ( P < 0.05), and perceptual speed ( P < 0.05), but not verbal ability (including verbal fluency), primary memory, visuospatial skill, or attention. 13 In comparison, we observed more robust associations for APOE ε4 in a much smaller sample, and the effects were present across all cognitive domains tested except visuospatial function ( Table 3 ). These data suggest that the deleterious effect of the ε4 allele seen in our PD cohort is in excess of the background APOE effect on cognition.

Relatively few studies have examined the MAPT H1 haplotype as a risk factor for CI in PD. The most frequently cited one was conducted in an incident cohort of 122 PD patients followed longitudinally for 5 years. MAPT H1 was associated with a more rapid decline in MMSE score ( p = 0.02) and was a significant risk factor for conversion to dementia (OR = 12.14, 95% CI 1.26-117.36). 21 Though patients in the study underwent detailed neuropsychological assessments, association tests between MAPT H1 and change over time in the other cognitive measures were not performed. A cross-sectional PD case-control study from Spain found that MAPT H1 was associated with PD in the overall sample, and the effect size was larger in demented patients (n = 48; OR = 3.73, 95% CI 1.64-8.46) than in non-demented patients (n = 154; OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.47) in comparison to cognitively intact controls. 20 However, the authors did not directly test for differences in H1 frequency between the demented and non-demented PD groups. A second cross-sectional study in Spain found no difference in H1 frequency between demented (n = 86) and non-demented (n = 138) PD patients. 40 In our much larger cohort we did not observe an association between MAPT H1 and baseline performance on any cognitive tests, and none of the variables examined even approached significance ( Table 3 ). Because of the substantial differences in methodologies employed, caution must be used in comparing our findings with those of previous studies. However, our results suggest that MAPT H1 is not associated with cognition in PD.

Our study had several limitations. We were not able to examine longitudinal measures of cognition since these data were not yet available for the majority of the cohort. Thus, we were only able to account for predictors of cognitive function by including demographic characteristics (e.g. years of education and age) in the regression models. Some of the cognitive measures used rely in part on motor function and thus motor symptoms might have interfered with test performance. To lessen these effects we tested subjects in the “on” state. Furthermore, for Trails B we attempted to correct for motor impairment by subtracting the Trails A score. Our participants had a higher than average mean level of education, a known contributor to performance across most cognitive measures. Thus, our sample might not be fully representative of all patients with PD. Though our sample size was large in comparison to previous studies, we might still have lacked adequate power to detect small effects of MAPT and SNCA variants on cognition.

We have shown that APOE is associated with cognitive performance in PD, but whether other modifier genes exist remains to be determined. We have begun work to address this issue using genome-wide techniques which will incorporate longitudinal data as they become available in our PD cohort. The identification of additional genetic determinants for CI in PD will shed new light on the pathophysiology of this disabling non-motor problem and could provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.
