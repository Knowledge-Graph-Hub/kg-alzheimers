Discovery of a Biomarker and Lead Small Molecules to Target r(GGGGCC)-Associated Defects in c9FTD/ALS

# Abstract
A repeat expansion in C9ORF72 causes frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9FTD/ALS). RNA of the expanded repeat (r(GGGGCC) exp ) forms nuclear foci or undergoes repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation producing “c9RAN proteins”. Since neutralizing r(GGGGCC) exp could inhibit these potentially toxic events, we sought to identify small molecule binders of r(GGGGCC) exp . Chemical and enzymatic probing of r(GGGGCC) 8 indicate it adopts a hairpin structure in equilibrium with a quadruplex structure. Using this model, bioactive small molecules targeting r(GGGGCC) exp were designed and found to significantly inhibit RAN translation and foci formation in cultured cells expressing r(GGGGCC) 66 and neurons trans-differentiated from fibroblasts of repeat expansion carriers. Finally, we show that poly(GP) c9RAN proteins are specifically detected in c9ALS patient cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings highlight r(GGGGCC) exp -binding small molecules as a possible c9FTD/ALS therapeutic, and suggest c9RAN proteins could potentially serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess efficacy of therapies that target r(GGGGCC) exp .

## Introduction
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are overlapping neurodegenerative diseases with no effective treatment. Success in developing a treatment will require a well-orchestrated effort that addresses multiple aspects of the drug discovery process, including target identification and validation, as well as the identification of biomarkers to assess efficacy of potential therapies in clinical trials. These endeavors have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of FTD and ALS pathogenesis. However, with the discovery that a GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of FTD and ALS ( DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011 ; Renton et al., 2011 ), a new therapeutic target has come to light.

Two putative pathomechanisms of “c9FTD/ALS” involve RNA transcribed from the expansion. First, these transcripts (termed r(GGGGCC) exp ) may cause toxicity through the formation of nuclear RNA foci that sequester various RNA-binding proteins [for review, see ( Gendron et al., 2014 )]. Second, r(GGGGCC) exp undergoes repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation producing “c9RAN proteins” that form neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system ( Ash et al., 2013 ; Mori et al., 2013b ). Consequently, neutralizing or degrading r(GGGGCC) exp holds promise as a therapeutic approach for c9FTD/ALS. Indeed, antisense oligonucleotides to C9ORF72 transcripts suppress features associated with the repeat expansion in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons ( Donnelly et al., 2013 ; Sareen et al., 2013 ). In light of pharmacological advantages, small molecules may offer an attractive option for targeting r(GGGGCC) exp . Capitalizing on our findings that r(GGGGCC) n adopts a hairpin structure in addition to a G-quadruplex one, we designed small molecules able to bind r(GGGGCC) exp and to significantly decrease RAN translation and foci formation in cultured cells expressing r(GGGGCC) 66 , and induced neurons (iNeurons) directly converted from fibroblasts of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers. These findings indicate that designer small molecules targeting r(GGGGCC) exp may prove promising as a c9FTD/ALS therapeutic. Furthermore, since we found that poly(GP) c9RAN proteins are detected in c9ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), poly(GP) proteins may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess efficacy of potential therapies that target r(GGGGCC) exp .

## Results
With the goal of designing small molecule modulators of r(GGGGCC), we investigated its structure. Using evidence from gel mobility shift assays and spectroscopic methods, previous reports suggest r(GGGGCC) forms intra- and intermolecular G-quadruplex structures ( Fratta et al., 2012 ; Reddy et al., 2013 ), with another suggesting r(GGGGCC) repeats adopt both G-quadruplex and hairpin structures ( Haeusler et al., 2014 ). To further probe the structure of r(GGGGCC), we completed spectroscopic (circular dichroism (CD) and optical melting), chemical (modification with dimethyl sulfate (DMS)), and enzymatic analyses (for a full description of our biophysical studies see Supplementary Information ). CD studies of r(GGGGCC) 4 , r(GGGGCC) 6 and r(GGGGCC) 8 revealed these RNAs likely fold into a G-quadruplex structure in the presence of K + but not Na + , which promotes a hairpin structure ( Fig. 1A ). We next studied the structures of r(GGGGCC) by optical melting, as G-quadruplexes have signature melting curves (large hypochromic transition of UV absorbance at 295 nm) ( Mergny et al., 1998 ). In agreement with CD studies, optical melts completed in the presence of Na + indicated that r(GGGGCC) 4 , r(GGGGCC) 6 and r(GGGGCC) 8 form intramolecular hairpins. In contrast, optical melts completed in the presence of K + indicate the presence of both hairpin and G-quadruplex structures ( Fig. 1B , Table S1 ).

The folding of r(GGGGCC) 8 was next examined using enzymatic and chemical mapping in the presence of Li + or K + , the latter known to stabilize G-quadruplexes ( Hardin et al., 1992 ). Enzymatic mapping revealed an alternating pattern of cleavage by enzymes that specifically cleave paired or non-canonically paired nucleotides ( Fig. 1C ), suggesting that some populations form a hairpin structure. These findings were confirmed using the chemical modification reagent DMS.

We additionally explored the structure of r(GGGGCC) 8 by analyzing its 1D 1 H NMR spectra. At low annealing temperatures, the NMR spectra indicate r(GGGGCC) 8 folds into a hairpin with non-canonically paired Gs in the stem (spectrum collected at 37 ° C; Fig. 1D ). As the annealing temperature increases, however, NMR peaks become broad, indicating increased population of a G-quadruplex. The existence of both conformations is not surprising as other studies have suggested RNAs that form quadruplexes can form alternative structures, including hairpins ( Bugaut et al., 2012 ).

Exploiting the findings above, we sought to identify small molecules that bind r(GGGGCC) exp and determine whether they improve c9FTD/ALS-associated defects. It was reported that TMPyP4, a known G-quadruplex binder, binds r(GGGGCC) 8 in vitro ( Zamiri et al., 2014 ). Although the bioactivity of TMPyP4 was not explored, these studies indicate it is possible to identify small molecules that bind r(GGGGCC) repeats. We previously developed a strategy to design small molecules that bind an RNA target using information about RNA-small molecule interactions ( Velagapudi et al., 2014 ). Small molecule leads can be further optimized by chemical similarity searching, which identifies compounds that are chemically similar to the leads. We reported that small molecule 1a binds 1×1 GG internal loops present in r(CGG) exp and improves fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)-associated defects ( Disney et al., 2012 ). Given the structural similarity between r(CGG) exp and r(GGGGCC) exp , we hypothesized that 1a and compounds chemically similar to it might bind r(GGGGCC) exp . We collected 132 such small molecules and screened them for binding to r(GGGGCC) 8 . Three lead compounds ( 1a , 2 and 3 ) were identified ( Fig. 1E , S1A; Table S2 ) and further characterized. Kinetic binding studies showed that 1a , 2 , and 3 bind to r(GGGGCC) 8 with K d 's of 9.7, 10, and 16 μM, respectively, similar to those observed for r(CGG) 12 . In contrast, 1a , 2 , and 3 bind more weakly to a hairpin with a fully paired stem, suggesting the compounds are at least modestly selective ( Fig. S1B ). We perturbed the equilibrium between hairpin and G-quadruplex structures by folding r(GGGGCC) 8 in the presence of an additional 100 mM NaCl (favors hairpin) or KCl (favors quadruplex). The observed K d 's for 1a and 3 were 3- to 10-fold weaker in the presence of Na + and K + , indicating that ionic strength affects binding. Of interest, the affinity of 2 for r(GGGGCC) 8 was not significantly affected by addition of Na + , but became >6-fold weaker in K + . These results indicate that compound 2 recognizes the hairpin structure over the G-quadruplex ( Fig. S1B ).

Given that small molecule binders of r(GGGGCC) exp may influence the thermodynamic stability of the RNA, which could in turn influence foci formation and RAN translation, optical melting was used to study whether compounds increase r(GGGGCC) 8 stability. While compound 3 did not significantly affect r(GGGGCC) 8 's stability or melting temperature, 1a and 2 stabilized the RNA by 0.95 and 0.63 kcal/mol, respectively, and increased the T m by 3.1 and 1.9 °C, respectively ( Fig. S1C & Table S3 ).

To determine whether compounds 1a , 2 and 3 bind r(GGGGCC) exp in cells, we employed COS7 cells transfected to express 66 GGGGCC repeats with no upstream ATG, and our previously reported strategy to identify small molecule cellular targets. In this strategy, small molecules are conjugated to: (i) a reactive module that forms a covalent cross-link with the target (chlorambucil; CA ); and (ii) biotin for facile isolation of small molecule-biomolecule adducts ( Guan and Disney, 2013 ). First, a biotin-chlorambucil conjugate of 1a was synthesized ( 1a-CA-biotin ; Fig. 2A , Fig. S2A,B ), added to (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells, and allowed to react with its cellular targets. Biomolecule-small molecule adducts were then isolated with streptavidin-functionalized resin. qRT-PCR analysis of the isolated fractions showed an 80-fold enrichment of r(GGGGCC) 66 compared to 18S rRNA (normalized to untreated lysate; Fig. 2B ). To determine whether 1a , 2 and 3 bind r(GGGGCC) exp directly, we completed a competitive profiling experiment by co-treating (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells with 1a-CA-biotin and the compound of interest. That is, the targets of 1a , 2 and 3 can be inferred by their depletion in pull-down fractions. Indeed, the amount of r(GGGGCC) 66 that forms an adduct with 1a-CA-biotin was significantly depleted in the presence of each compound ( Fig. 2B ).

Having established that all three compounds bind r(GGGGCC) 66 , we evaluated their effect on RAN translation. While no evidence of RAN translation was seen in HEK293 cells expressing only 2 or 20 (GGGGCC) repeats, expression of (GGGGCC) 66 resulted in the synthesis of poly(GP) and poly(GA) proteins ( Fig. 2C ), but not poly(GR) proteins (not shown). Compound 3 (100 μM, 24 h) modestly inhibited synthesis of poly(GP) proteins, but did not influence poly(GA) protein production ( Fig. 2D ). In contrast, compounds 1a and 2 significantly decreased both poly(GP) and poly(GA) protein levels ( Fig. 2D ). Given that 1a and 2 have similar effects on RAN translation, and that 1a also inhibits this event in iNeurons (shown below), we tested additional concentrations of 1a and found it affords a dose-dependent effect on RAN translation; statistically significant decreases in poly(GP) of 10, 18 and 47% were detected by immunoassay of lysates from (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells treated with 25, 50 or 100 μM, respectively ( Fig. S2C ).

In addition to the accumulation of c9RAN proteins, nuclear foci are detected in (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells ( Fig. 2E ). Consistent with their effect on RAN translation, compounds 1a and 2 , but not 3 , significantly decreased the percentage of foci-positive cells ( Fig. 2F ). This was likely caused by inhibition of foci formation, and not a result of impaired binding of the probe to r(GGGGCC) 66 in the presence of compound, given that conducting RNA FISH on fixed, non-treated (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells with a probe co-incubated with 1a did not prevent detection of foci ( Fig. S2D ).

Since the C9ORF72 repeat expansion is bidirectionally transcribed in c9FTD/ALS, and since antisense transcripts containing (CCCCGG) repeats are also RAN translated and form foci ( Gendron et al., 2013 ; Mori et al., 2013a ; Zu et al., 2013 ), we evaluated the effect of 1a in r(CCCCGG) 66 -expressing cells previously shown to express poly(PR) and poly(GP) proteins ( Gendron et al., 2013 ). Whereas 1a (100 μM, 24 h) significantly decreased poly(GP) proteins RAN translated from sense transcripts ( Fig. 2G ), it had no effect on poly(GP) or poly(PR) proteins RAN translated from antisense r(CCCCGG) 66 , as assessed by immunoassay ( Fig. 2H ; see Fig. S2E and Fig. S4A for assay validation). Likewise, no change in the percentage of cells bearing r(CCCCGG) foci was detected following 1a treatment ( Fig. 2I ). In contrast, we reported that 1a does reduce foci in r(CGG) 60 -expressing cells ( Disney et al., 2012 ), and we show here that 1a also inhibits RAN translation in cells expressing (CGG) 88 placed in the 5'UTR of GFP, but does not affect downstream canonical translation ( Fig. 2J ). These results confirm the structural similarity between r(CGG) exp and r(GGGGCC) exp in cells, and selectivity of 1a towards this structure.

To establish a more physiological disease cell model, fibroblasts with or without the C9ORF72 repeat expansion were directly converted to a neuronal lineage by repressing polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB1), as recently described ( Xue et al., 2013 ). PTB1 depletion caused fibroblasts to adopt a neuronal morphology with reduced soma size and neurite formation ( Fig. 3A,B and S3A ). These iNeurons expressed neuronal and synaptic markers, including MAP2, TUJ1, PSD95, Synapsin I and Drebrin ( Fig. 3A , S3B ). Nuclear foci, degraded by RNase A but resistant to DNase I ( Fig. S3C ), were present in both C9ORF72+ fibroblasts ( Fig. S3D ) and iNeurons ( Fig. 3C ). Cytoplasmic poly(GP) inclusions, as well as poly(PR) inclusions, were also present in C9ORF72+ iNeurons ( Fig.3C ), but were not found in parental fibroblasts ( Fig. S3E ). No foci or poly(GP) inclusions were detected in iNeurons lacking the expanded repeat ( Fig. 3C ). Of importance, in three C9ORF72+ iNeuron lines, compound 1a significantly decreased the percentage of cells with RNA foci ( Fig. 3D ) and poly(GP) inclusions ( Fig. 3E,F ), while having no effect on C9ORF72 mRNA levels ( Fig. S3F ). Consistent with findings in (GGGGCC) 66 -expressing cells, a dose-dependent decrease in RAN translation of poly(GP) was observed in 1a -treated C9ORF72+ iNeurons, but no change in poly(PR) expression, which is synthesized from the antisense transcript, was detected ( Fig. S3G ). Due to toxicity associated with compound 2 in iNeurons, it was not tested in this model. Taken together, our data indicate that our strategy to design small molecule modulators of r(GGGGCC) led to the successful identification of a compound that mitigates abnormal events initiated by r(GGGGCC) exp .

Our findings above indicate that r(GGGGCC) exp -targeting small molecules can inhibit foci formation and RAN translation. Consequently, if c9RAN proteins are detected in CSF, they have the potential to serve as a measurable indicator of therapeutic efficacy. To test this notion, we developed a poly(GP) protein immunoassay ( Fig. S4A ) and validated it as a sensitive means to measure endogenous poly(GP) using soluble fractions of frontal cortex tissues. As expected, poly(GP) was specifically detected in c9FTD/ALS samples ( Fig. S4B ).

To test poly(GP) proteins as clinically relevant biomarkers, we evaluated whether they are detectable in CSF. We analyzed CSF from 14 c9ALS patients in comparison to CSF from 25 ALS patients without the C9ORF72 mutation and 5 healthy subjects (see Table S4 for patient details). As shown in Fig. 4A , poly(GP) proteins were detected only in c9ALS CSF. Using a (GP) 8 peptide standard curve, we estimate the median concentration of poly(GP) in c9ALS CSF to be 0.67 ng/ml ( Fig. S4C, Table S4 ). These exciting findings provide an important first step in identifying pharmacodynamic biomarkers for c9FTD/ALS ( Fig. 4B ).

## Discussion
In the present study, we provide evidence that: 1) r(GGGGCC) exp adopts both hairpin and G-quadruplex structures – information important for the design of r(GGGGCC)-binding small molecules; 2) human fibroblasts can be directly converted to neurons that recapitulate salient features of disease; 3) small molecules that bind r(GGGGCC) exp inhibit RAN translation and foci formation; and 4) c9RAN proteins are detectable in c9ALS CSF.

Recent studies show that r(GGGGCC) repeats forms G-quadruplexes ( Fratta et al., 2012 ; Reddy et al., 2013 ), with another reporting they adopt both G-quadruplex and hairpin structures ( Haeusler et al., 2014 ). In agreement with the latter, our chemical and enzymatic probing studies reveal that r(GGGGCC) 8 do form a hairpin structure. NMR studies suggest that the hairpin structure predominates at low refolding temperatures while the quadruplex predominates at higher ones. To understand the finer details of this equilibrium in cells, chemical mapping could be completed as described in yeast ( Wells et al., 2000 ), although readout using reverse transcriptase could be challenging. Alternatively, antibodies that recognize RNA quadruplexes could be employed ( Lam et al., 2013 ).

We identified three compounds that bind r(GGGGCC) ( 1a , 2 and 3 ), two of which significantly inhibited RAN translation and foci formation in a novel r(GGGGCC) 66 cell model developed for the rapid screening of drugs. In addition, we found that 1a inhibits RAN translation and foci formation in C9ORF72+ iNeurons. This report shows that adult human fibroblasts can be directly converted to neurons that mirror disease-specific defects and that these defects can be blocked by pharmacological manipulation. Of interest, RNA foci were observed in both C9ORF72 + fibroblasts and iNeurons, while poly(GP) and poly(PR) inclusions were observed in iNeurons but not fibroblasts. These findings are consistent with our observation that poly(GP) inclusions are restricted to neurons in c9FTD/ALS ( Ash et al., 2013 ).

There are at least two mechanisms by which our small molecules may affect RAN translation. In the first model, their binding to r(GGGGCC) exp increases the thermodynamic stability of the RNA and is thus an impediment for ribosomal read-through of the transcript. Indeed, 1a and 2 stabilize r(GGGGCC) 8 in vitro . In a second model, the binding of small molecules to the repeats impedes initiation of translation at these sites. In a similar fashion, the decrease in foci observed upon treatment could result from the inability of 1a - or 2 -bound r(GGGGCC) exp to bind RBPs that promote foci formation.

As a pathological hallmark of c9FTD/ALS, and one that is influenced by r(GGGGCC) exp - targeting small molecules, c9RAN proteins have potential to serve as clinically relevant biomarkers. Our discovery that poly(GP) is detectable specifically in c9ALS CSF could facilitate identification of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers in the course of diagnostic work-ups, and pave the way in determining whether changes in c9RAN protein levels in CSF correlate with disease severity or progression. Of importance, CSF c9RAN proteins could serve as an enrollment stratification tool in clinical trials, and a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess efficacy of therapies that target r(GGGGCC) exp ( Fig. 4B ). While these critical questions are investigated, it should be kept in mind that the C9ORF72 expansion is bidirectionally transcribed ( Gendron et al., 2013 ; Mori et al., 2013a ; Zu et al., 2013 ); as such, therapeutics may have to target both r(GGGGCC) exp and r(CCCCGG) exp . Because poly(GP) proteins are produced by RAN translation of sense and antisense transcripts, poly(GP) immunoassays, such as the one described herein, could be of great use in testing therapeutics toward both r(GGGGCC) exp and r(CCCCGG) exp .

## Materials and Methods
For 1 H NMR spectroscopy, r(GGGGCC) 8 (600 μM) was prepared in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 and 100 mM KCl and annealed at the appropriate temperature for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. After equilibration for 2 h, NMR spectra were recorded at 10°C.

To identify RNA targets of 1a, 2 and 3 , COS7 cells expressing r(GGGGCC) 66 were treated with 1a-CA-Biotin and compound of interest. Total RNA was extracted 24 h later and incubated with streptavidin beads. cDNA was generated from bound RNA- 1a-CA-Biotin adducts released from beads for quantitation of r(GGGGCC) 66 by qPCR. To detect products of RAN translation, lysates were prepared from (GGGGCC) n -expressing HEK293 cells treated or not with compound for Western blotting using anti-GP, anti-GA or anti-GR antibodies. The effect of 1a was also tested in cells expressing r(CGG) 88 embedded in the 5’ UTR of an open reading frame encoding GFP to allow detection of RAN translated products by Western blot using anti-GFP. Poly(GP) or poly(PR) expression in (GGGGCC) n -expressing cells, human brain lysates and CSF were evaluated by sandwich immunoassays. Foci in (GGGGCC) n -expressing cells were visualized by RNA FISH using a Cy3-(GGCCCC) 4 probe.

Fibroblasts derived from patient skin samples were converted to iNeurons by transduction with pLKO.1 coding for shPTB1 ( Xue et al., 2013 ). Poly(GP) and poly(PR) expression in iNeurons treated or not with 1a were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining, and foci visualized by FISH using a locked nucleic acid probe (5′TYE563-CCCCGGCCCCGGCCCC-3’). RNA extracted from iNeurons was utilized for qRT-PCR analysis of C9ORF72 mRNA expression.

Data is presented as the mean±SEM from a minimum of three experiments unless otherwise indicated. Statistical comparisons were made by Student's t-test or ANOVA. Statistical significance was inferred at P<0.05.
