Functional Connectivity in Autosomal Dominant and Late-Onset
Alzheimer Disease

# Abstract
Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is caused by rare genetic
mutations in three specific genes, in contrast to late-onset Alzheimer
Disease (LOAD), which has a more polygenetic risk profile. We analyzed functional connectivity in multiple brain resting state
networks (RSNs) in a cross-sectional cohort of ADAD (N=79) and LOAD (N=444)
human participants using resting state functional connectivity MRI
(rs-fcMRI) at multiple international academic sites. For both types of AD, we quantified and compared functional
connectivity changes in RSNs as a function of dementia severity as measured
by clinical dementia rating (CDR). In ADAD, we qualitatively investigated
functional connectivity changes with respect to estimated years from onset
of symptoms within five RSNs. Functional connectivity decreases with increasing CDR were similar
for both LOAD and ADAD in multiple RSNs. Ordinal logistic regression models
constructed in each type of AD accurately predicted CDR stage in the other,
further demonstrating similarity of functional connectivity loss in each
disease type. Among ADAD participants, functional connectivity in multiple
RSNs appeared qualitatively lower in asymptomatic mutation carriers near
their anticipated age of symptom onset compared to asymptomatic mutation
non-carriers. rs-fcMRI changes with progressing AD severity are similar between
ADAD and LOAD. Rs-fcMRI may be a useful endpoint for LOAD and ADAD therapy
trials. ADAD disease process may be an effective model for LOAD disease
process.

## Introduction
Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is the leading cause of dementia
worldwide, currently affecting more than 18 million people 1 . AD is defined by pathological accumulation of tau
neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques 2 . While AD is typically late-onset
and polygenetic (LOAD), in a small subset of individuals AD is inherited as an
autosomal dominant trait (autosomal dominant AD or ADAD), which is typically
early-onset and caused by monogenetic mutations in the genes encoding presenilin 1,
presenilin 2, or amyloid precursor protein. These mutations are ~100%
penetrant and cause AD by affecting Aβ cleavage and folding 3 .

Discovery of ADAD mutations has enabled researchers to develop transgenic
mouse models and cell lines expressing these mutations 4 . These experimental models have enabled the
preclinical testing of potential anti-amyloid AD therapies 5 . By studying ADAD individuals who will develop
dementia at a predictable age, researchers can identify the temporal dynamics of
changes in biomarker profiles before the development of clinical symptoms 6 . However, questions remain
concerning the extent to which findings in ADAD translate to LOAD.

Converging evidence from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), amyloid imaging, and
brain volumetric studies 7 , 8 suggests that ADAD and LOAD are
similar disease processes. However, biomarker differences exist between LOAD and
ADAD. Specifically, ADAD individuals may have greater amyloid plaque deposition in
the basal ganglia compared to LOAD individuals 9 . Additionally, increased levels of CSF
Aβ 1−42 have been observed very early in ADAD but not in
LOAD 8 .

One biomarker of interest in LOAD that is relatively unestablished in ADAD is
resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) 10 , 11 .
Functional connectivity measures the correlation structure of blood oxygen-level
dependent (BOLD) signals between regions of interest (ROI), collections of which
form resting state networks (RSNs) 12 , 13 . In LOAD, reduced
functional connectivity has been observed with progressing clinical status [measured
by clinical dementia rating (CDR)] 14 within the default mode network (DMN), a RSN comprised of
regions known to harbor Aβ 15 and tau 16 pathology. DMN functional connectivity decreases have also been noted in
presymptomatic individuals genetically at risk for LOAD 17 . Recently, abnormalities in functional
connectivity have been observed in the dorsal attention (DAN); executive-control
(CON); salience (SAL); and sensorimotor (SMN) networks that parallel deteriorating
cognitive status 18 .

We measured functional connectivity in a cross-sectional cohort of
asymptomatic and symptomatic ADAD participants [mutation positive (M+; n=54) and
mutation negative (M–; n=25)] and a cross-sectional cohort of LOAD
individuals (n=74 very mild AD dementia, n=27 mild AD dementia, and n=343
cognitively normal older adults). We show that functional connectivity changes with
respect to CDR are similar for both types of AD (i.e., ADAD and LOAD) 18 .

## Materials and Methods
The ADAD cohort was drawn from the international Dominantly Inherited
Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and consisted of participants from ADAD families, both
individuals with mutations (M+) and individuals lacking mutations (M–)
( Table 1 ). We excluded from the
analysis 26 M+ individuals and 7 M–individuals who were scanned with
inconsistent sequence parameters. We removed one additional M–
participant with questionable clinical status. Cross-sectional data available as
of February 2012 were included in this analysis 19 . Only subjects that passed quality control
(described below) were included in the final analysis.

A separate cohort of participants was enrolled in a longitudinal study
at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington
University in St. Louis (WUSTL) designed to track individuals at risk for LOAD
through the stages of cognitive decline 18 . All participants from both cohorts provided informed
consent according to institutional review board procedures at their respective
institutions. Each participant completed a general physical (including
neurologic) examination, health and medication history, and clinical assessment
for dementia 20 . We used
independent general linear mixed models to assess group differences in
demographics.

Experienced clinicians conducted semi-structured interviews of each
participant and a knowledgeable collateral source. The clinical dementia rating
scale (CDR) was used to determine and stage dementia severity 14 . CDR0 indicates cognitive
normality, CDR0.5 corresponds to very mild dementia, and CDR≥1 specifies
mild and moderate dementia. In other studies, certain CDR0.5 participants may be
classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, depending on the
staging criteria 21 . Five
participants from the ADAD CDR≥1 cohort had more advanced disease [CDR2
(n=4); CDR3 (n=1)]. All CDR > 0 participants had a clinical diagnosis of
AD dementia in accordance with standard criteria. 22 Disease biomarkers such as PiB PET
imaging 23 and CSF
measures 24 were not
explicitly taken into account for the diagnosis of LOAD, but when available were
used to exclude participants with profiles inconsistent with AD.

Within the DIAN cohort, parent age at symptomatic onset was determined
from semi-structured interviews with the participant, a knowledgeable collateral
source, and/or other informants familiar with the parental history of disease.
The age at onset of the affected parent was determined by estimating the time of
onset of symptoms (e.g., memory/cognition, motor or behavior). The anticipated
age at symptomatic onset (AAO) for each individual was indexed to the AAO for
that individual's affected parent. The estimated years from symptom onset (EYO)
for each DIAN individual was defined as [(age at testing) –
AAO] 5 .

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and apolipoprotein E (APOE)
genotyping was conducted according to previously-published methods 25 . Individuals were defined to
be APOE4 positive if they had at least one ε4 allele.

For both cohorts, neuroimaging was performed using 3T Siemens Tim Trio
scanners (Erlangen, Germany) equipped with the standard 12-channel head coil
using previously-described methods (see supplemental ; also see Table 2 ). Structural images were acquired to allow alignment of
rs-fcMRI images to atlas space 18 .

Initial preprocessing of all rs-fcMRI data (both ADAD and LOAD) followed
conventional methods as previously described 18 , 26 which were
modified to correct for non-optimal order of operations 27 (see supplemental ). Spurious
variance was reduced by regression of nuisance time-series derived from head
motion correction and extraction of BOLD activity from white matter, CSF
regions, as well as the BOLD time-series averaged over the whole brain (or
global signal) 28 .

rs-fcMRI analyses and quality control procedures for ADAD and LOAD
participants followed previously-described methods (see supplemental ) 29 . Subjects with either outlier
rms movement or excessive frame removal (>40%) were excluded from further
analysis.

For all participants, we extracted time-series data from thirty-five
6-mm radius spherical brain regions of interest (ROIs) distributed throughout 5
functionally-defined RSNs including the DMN † , DAN, CON, SAL, and SMN ( Figure 1 ). Briefly, intra-network composite scores were
obtained by averaging BOLD correlation values computed between ROIs belonging to
a particular RSN and inter-network composite scores were obtained by averaging
correlations from ROIs belonging to separate RSNs. Using a composite score for
intra and inter-network comparisons serves to reduce the amount of data while
reducing the potential impact of sampling error. We analyzed composite scores
for 5 intra-network (DMN, DAN, CON, SAL, SMN) and 3 inter-network (DMN:DAN,
DMN:SMN, CON:SMN) composites which we have previously shown to be affected by
LOAD 18 .

Generalized linear mixed models were used for each RSN composite to
assess the fixed effects of CDR and AD type as well as their interaction. For
ADAD, this model did not include CDR0 M– group in order to preserve the
balance of the model between LOAD and ADAD. Differences between CDR0 M+ and CDR0
M– were assessed using the model that incorporates EYO described below.
However, we include the CDR 0 M– group in each figure for comparison
purposes. We also included ADAD family as a random effect because it is likely
that functional connectivity measures are correlated for members of a common
family. The AD type factor is a single fixed factor accounting for differences
in average age and scanner acquisition parameters between the LOAD and ADAD
groups. We assessed significant pair-wise effects (e.g., between CDR0 M+ and
CDR0.5 M+) by extracting individual contrasts from the omnibus model. We
compared the pair-wise effect size for different CDR stages between groups
(e.g., CDR0.5 – CDR1 ADAD vs. CDR0.5 – CDR1 LOAD) using the Q test
for effect size heterogeneity. We subsequently re-fit the preceding models
adding factors in a stepwise fashion to account for the random effect of scanner
and fixed effects of age and APOE ε4 status.

To analyze the effect of EYO on functional connectivity in the ADAD
cohort, generalized linear mixed models were constructed for each RSN with EYO,
quadratic effect of EYO (EYO 2 )
and mutation status, as well as interactions among these factors. ADAD family
membership was included as a random effect. Changes in RSN strength with respect
to EYO were displayed using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing
(LOESS) 7 . To protect
the confidentiality of participants’ mutation status, individual data
points were not displayed.

To qualitatively assess whole-brain changes in DMN-associated functional
connectivity with respect to EYO in the M+ ADAD group, we computed voxel-wise
correlations between a 6 mm ROI in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; an
important node of the DMN) and each voxel in the brain for each subject. We then
used a LOESS model to predict PCC functional connectivity at each value of EYO
in the range [-25,10] at 0.1 year increments for M+ individuals and displayed
these predicted values using a movie. Each frame of the movie shows the
predicted whole-brain average PCC-seed functional connectivity for a specific
EYO value. Warm regions represent positive average within-DMN functional
connectivity; cool regions represent negative between-network functional
connectivity.

We used ordinal logistic regression to perform a cross-regression
analysis that further elucidated similarities between ADAD and LOAD. We fit a
regression to predict CDR using the 5 intra-network and 3 inter-network
composite values. We fit a separate model in each AD type and used this to
predict CDR values for participants in the other AD type. We used Spearman rank
correlations to assess the similarity between actual and predicted CDR
values.

## Results
Initially, we combined both cohorts to test for the main effect of CDR
stage on intra-network functional connectivity ( Figure 2 ). A mixed model (corrected for mean age and acquisition
differences between cohorts as well as a random effect of ADAD family
membership) showed a significant main effect of CDR for multiple RSNs including
the DMN, DAN, and CON (col. 1 Table 3 ).
Only the SAL and SMN networks did not show a significant effect of CDR. In
general, pairwise comparison between CDR stages showed that functional
connectivity was lower in a step-wise fashion for the LOAD cohort (col. 2-4 Table 4 ). A similar pattern was
observed for ADAD, although individual pair-wise differences (e.g., from CDR0 to
CDR0.5) were generally not significant (cols. 2-4 Table 4 ). Stepwise inclusion of additional factors that
assessed fixed effects of age as a continuous covariate and APOE ε4
status as well as a random effect of ADAD acquisition site reduced the observed
effect sizes, but did not remove them (cols. 1-3 Table 3 ).

Although the general patterns of intra-network functional connectivity
changes seen for ADAD and LOAD were similar, subtle differences were observed.
When pair-wise effect sizes (Cohen's d ) differed between ADAD
and LOAD, the CDR effect was in general greater in ADAD compared to LOAD.

Inter-network functional connectivity was also decreased in magnitude
with respect to CDR in both LOAD and ADAD (cols. 2-7 Figure 3 ). Inter-network (e.g., DMN:DAN) BOLD correlations
typically are negative in sign (i.e., anti-correlations) in data preprocessed
using global signal regression 28 . As previously reported, LOAD cross-network
anti-correlations were diminished (i.e., closer to zero) with advancing
CDR 18 . A similar
finding was observed in ADAD (cols. 2-4 Figure
2 ), where decreased anti-correlation magnitude was observed for
DMN:DAN but not DMN:SMN or CON:SMN (col. 1 Table
3 ). Stepwise inclusion of additional factors testing for fixed
effects of age as a continuous covariate, APOE ε4 status, and the random
effect of ADAD acquisition site reduced the effects, but did not remove them
( Table 3b ).

In order to further characterize the similarity between AD types, we fit
ordinal logistic regression models (see Methods) in ADAD and used these to
predict CDR levels in LOAD (and vice versa). The model fit in ADAD was able to
predict LOAD CDR levels much better than chance (t(d.f.=442)=5.11; p <0.0001). The inverse process also allowed us to
predict ADAD CDR levels based on LOAD data better than chance
(t(d.f.=52)=4.51, p <0.0001). Cross-AD type
classification was unsuccessful for predicting genetic risk in the absence of
clinical symptoms.

For ADAD, we show how functional connectivity changes occur relative to
expected years from onset of symptoms (EYO) in all M+ individuals including
individuals destined to develop cognitive impairment and those already
symptomatic. Figure 4 presents LOESS plots
of RSN composites scores against EYO and demonstrates a qualitative decrease in
the DMN several years prior to expected symptom onset. Figure 5 presents the same analysis for the between RSN
data. The limited size of this cohort spread over many decades of EYO precludes
statistical demonstration of this effect but suggests that functional
connectivity may slightly precede cognitive symptoms.

We constructed a movie that demonstrates progressive loss of intra- and
inter-network functional connectivity in the M+ group using the PCC as a seed.
The fitted model predicted qualitative changes in functional connectivity in M+
participants prior to anticipated age of onset (AAO) ( Movie 1 ).

## Discussion
ADAD and LOAD manifest similar functional connectivity changes with respect
to CDR. Moreover, regression models constructed in one cohort distinguished CDR
stages in the other. This result demonstrates that functional connectivity changes
manifest similarly in both types of AD. However, some differences exist between AD
types in functional connectivity. A modestly greater effect of disease severity was
seen for ADAD compared to LOAD. The available data suggest that ADAD may serve as an
effective model to study LOAD pathophysiology, albeit with some reservations.

The first studies to investigate LOAD using rs-fcMRI detected changes in the
DMN 30 . More recent work
from our group has reported decreased functional connectivity in a wider set of
intra and inter-network relationships 18 . These results are recapitulated in our current study, where we
show similar effects of CDR on RSN connectivity in LOAD and ADAD. Similarities were
also evident between ADAD and LOAD when a regression model was fit in each group
using all analyzed RSNs as features and used these models to predict CDR levels in
the other. Our success fitting CDR models in the ADAD cohort and predicting CDR
status for the LOAD cohort (and vice versa) further suggests similar widespread RSN
changes in both AD types.

However, analysis of the certain RSN composites suggested a slightly more
pronounced decline for ADAD compared to LOAD. The greater loss in functional
connectivity seen in ADAD in certain networks may suggest that ADAD is a more
aggressive process than LOAD 31 , 32 . We previously hypothesized that
inter-network correlations may reflect a mechanism by which pathology spreads from
one functional network to the next in a cascading disease process 33 . There may be a more rapid and
dramatic accumulation of Aβ and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in
ADAD compared to LOAD 34 . Hence,
the observed rapid decline both within and between certain RSNs possibly reflects a
faster spread of pathology from the DMN across diseased connections in ADAD.

Biomarker profiles accrue with age along distinct intra-individual
trajectories in LOAD and ADAD 6 , 35 . In ADAD, we show evidence
suggesting that functional connectivity decreases with EYO only in the M+ group. In
M+ individuals, intra-individual changes in BOLD correlations within and between
networks may serve as an effective biomarker of disease progression. Functional
connectivity is a potentially useful biomarker in ADAD. However, we have only
demonstrated qualitative differences between M+ and M– groups temporally
proximate to the anticipated age of onset, suggesting that gross changes in
intra-network functional connectivity likely occur later than changes in metabolism,
hippocampal volume, and CSF Aβ and tau. Observed changes in BOLD correlations
may reflect downstream pathophysiological processes 7 . Ongoing longitudinal studies will assess the
usefulness of functional connectivity in tracking pre-clinical AD.

Our results differ from previous results on three points. First, individual
RSN composite scores were not significantly different for asymptomatic participants
with genetic risk factors in either cohort. This conflicts with previous studies of
LOAD that showed DMN functional connectivity changes within network in asymptomatic
individuals with Aβ plaque deposits 36 or a family history of LOAD 37 . Second, we did not observe a transient increase
in functional connectivity in the SAL for ADAD participants as was previously
observed for LOAD 18 , 38 . This suggests another possible
difference between LOAD and ADAD. Finally, in contrast to a recent study from
Chhatwal et al., 11 we were unable
to demonstrate at a statistically significant divergence between the M+ and
M– individuals prior to symptom onset, though qualitatively our data are
consistent with that finding. This difference possibly reflects the fact that
Chhatwal et al analyzed ROI-level changes whereas here we analyzed network-level
changes. We were able to demonstrate voxel-level DMN functional connectivity changes
using a LOESS movie. This qualitatively confirmed the Chhatwal et al. results using
a ROI. Indeed, the ADAD cohort reported by Chhatwal et al., is the same cohort
reported here although we excluded several additional participants due to scan
parameter issues.

This study made use of network composite scores as a measure of functional
connectivity strength 18 which have
several strengths but also make two assumptions. First, composite scores are a data
reduction strategy, reducing the burden of multiple comparisons. Second, they reduce
sampling error of observing any single functional connectivity pair within an RSN.
However, they assume that each functional connectivity pair in an RSN behaves
similarly. This has been previously been shown to be valid in LOAD but may obscure
focal changes such as those previously seen in ADAD 11 . In addition, composite scores assume that an
ROI's RSN membership does not change with disease, which could bias the
measurement.

Several limitations arose from the design of this study. First, there were
scanning differences between cohorts. This complicates demonstration of average
differences between cohorts, but this does not impact our ability to demonstrate
similarities between AD types. Second, our LOAD cohort was significantly older than
our ADAD cohort. This is an unavoidable confound in any study comparing LOAD to
early-onset ADAD. We addressed this issue by correcting for age differences between
the two cohorts. Finally, it has been argued that EYO might not be the best estimate
of disease progression in CDR0.5 ADAD participants. However, because CDR0.5
individuals are difficult to stage precisely, EYO is the most practical measure in a
cross-sectional study. Larger longitudinal studies will be able to more fully
characterize ADAD and LOAD functional connectivity changes and place them in
temporal relation to other biomarkers (especially CSF tau, Aβ, positron
emission tomography (PET), volumetrics, and amyloid imaging). Volumetric comparisons
are particularly important to this study since atrophy may influence the measured
BOLD signal. Future studies directly comparing these two measures will be
important.

Finally, this study made use of the global signal regression (GSR)
preprocessing step. This procedure is controversial 28 , 39 . It is
algebraically true that GSR forces the mean of correlations across the brain to be
zero and can make negative correlations more apparent. However, correlations
following GSR are essentially first-order partial correlations accounting for widely
shared variance while correlations without GSR are canonical correlations. This
makes correlations with and without GSR two fundamentally different statistical
quantities reflecting different types of relationships. It is likely that some of
the removed signal is of neural origin 40 however a large fraction of the global signal is related to
residual effects of head motion 29 and fluctuations in pCO2 41 . Thus,
we viewed GSR as a necessary step for noise reduction in this cross-scanner,
multi-site study. Beyond its noise reduction properties 42 , GSR has been shown to increase the concordance
between BOLD correlation mapping and electrocorticography, particularly for negative
correlations 43 , indicating
an important relationship to neurobiology.
