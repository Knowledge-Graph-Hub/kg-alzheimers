# Title
Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proteomics

# Abstract
APEX is an engineered peroxidase that functions both as an electron microscopy tag, and as a promiscuous labeling enzyme for live-cell proteomics. Because the limited sensitivity of APEX precludes applications requiring low APEX expression, we used yeast display evolution to improve its catalytic efficiency. Our evolved APEX2 is far more active in cells, enabling the superior enrichment of endogenous mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins and the use of electron microscopy to resolve the sub-mitochondrial localization of calcium uptake regulatory protein MICU1.

## Online Methods
HEK 293T, HeLa, or COS-7 cells from ATCC (passage number < 20) were cultured in growth media (either MEM (Cellgro) or 1:1 DMEM:MEM mixture (Cellgro)) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin) at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . Mycoplasma testing was not performed prior to experiments. For imaging experiments, cells were grown on 7 × 7 mm glass cover slips in 48-well plates. To improve the adherence of HEK293T cells, glass slides were pretreated with 50 μg/mL fibronectin (Millipore) for 15 min at 37 °C before cell plating and washed three times with DPBS, pH 7.4. Cells were transfected at 60–80% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), typically with 0.7 μL Lipofectamine 2000 and 100 ng plasmid per 300,000 cells. Cells were labeled and/or fixed 18–24 h after transfection.

Genes were introduced into HEK 293T or COS-7 cells either through transient transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 or lentiviral infection. For lipofection, 100 ng of the APEX-fusion plasmid and 0.7 μL Lipofectamine 2000 in MEM (without serum) was used per well of a 48-well plate (0.95 cm 2 ) of cells at 60-80% confluence. 3-6 hours later, the cell culture medium was changed back to fresh growth media. After 24 hours, biotin-phenol labeling was initiated by changing the medium to 200 μL of fresh growth media containing 500 μM biotin-phenol. This was incubated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 for 30 minutes according to previously published protocols 1 . Afterwards, 2 μL of 100 mM H 2 O 2 was added to each well, for a final concentration of 1 mM H 2 O 2 , and the plate gently agitated for 1 minute. The reaction was then quenched by addition of 200 μL of 10 mM Trolox and 20 mM sodium ascorbate in DPBS (for a final concentration of 5 mM Trolox and 10 mM sodium ascorbate). Cells were washed with DPBS containing 5 mM Trolox and 10 mM sodium ascorbate three times and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in DPBS at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then washed with DPBS three times and permeabilized with cold methanol at -20°C for 5 min. Cells were washed again three times with DPBS and blocked for 1 hour with 3% BSA in DPBS (“blocking buffer”) at 4°C. To detect APEX-fusion expression, cells were incubated with either mouse-α-FLAG antibody (Agilent, 1:500 dilution) or mouse-α-V5 antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500 dilution) for 1 hour to overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with 0.2% Tween in DPBS, cells were simultaneously incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, 1:750 dilution) and homemade streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 568 conjugates for 1 hour at 4°C. Cells were then washed three times with 0.2% Tween in DPBS and maintained in DPBS on ice for imaging.

Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axio Observer. Z1 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head and a Cascade II: 512 camera. The confocal head contained a Quad-band notch dichroic mirror (405/488/568/647 nm). Samples were excited by solid state 491 nm (∼20 mW) or 561 nm (∼20 mW) lasers. Images were acquired using Slidebook 5.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations), through a 48 × oil-immersion objective for YFP/AF488 (528/38 emission filter), AF568 (617/73 emission filter), and differential interference contrast (DIC) channels. Acquisition times ranged from 10 to 1000 milliseconds. Imaging conditions and intensity scales were matched for each dataset presented together unless otherwise noted.

For streptavidin blotting, HEK293T cells in wells of a 6-well plate were transfected with APXNES variants and labeled under the same conditions described for biotin-phenol imaging above. After 1 minute of labeling, the cells were washed 3 times with quencher solution (10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox), then scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet was stored at -80 °C, then lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 × protease cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, catalog no. P8849), 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox) for 1 minute at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended by gentle pipetting. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C before separation on a 9% SDS-PAGE gel. For blotting analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, stained by Ponceau S (10 minutes in 0.1% w/v Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid/water), and blocked with “blot blocking buffer” (3% w/v BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were immersed in streptavidin-HRP in blot blocking buffer (1:3000 dilution, Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for 60 minutes, then rinsed with blot blocking buffer 5 × 5 minutes before development with Clarity™ reagent (Bio-Rad) and imaging on an Alpha Innotech gel imaging system. For assessing comparative enzyme expression level, an identical gel and blot was prepared in parallel, and immunoblotted with α-FLAG-M2-HRP (1:3000, Sigma).

For blotting of endogenous proteins, HEK293T cells were grown in 6-well plates and infected at ∼50% confluency with 500 μL lentivirus prepared as described above. After 48 hours, cells were split into T25 flasks. From the same suspensions, cells were also plated into 48-well plates for side-by-side biotinphenol and immunofluorescence to check for enzyme activity and comparable enzyme expression levels. Biotin phenol labeling in the T25 flasks was performed with 30 minutes preincubation of 500 μM biotinphenol in 4 mL of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM:MEM (both from Cellgro) at 37°C. Flasks were quickly inverted so biotin-phenol media was on the ceiling of the flask, and 40 μL of 100 mM H 2 O 2 was added (for a final concentration of 1 mM) to the media and agitated to mix. Flasks were again inverted and cells were exposed to the 1 mM H 2 O 2 and 500 μM biotin-phenol solution for 1 minute at room temperature. After the 1 minute duration, the flask was inverted and the solution replaced with 5 mL of ice cold DPBS with quenchers (5 mM Trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide) and the flask re-inverted for 1 minute. The flask was then washed with 5 mL DPBS + quenchers two more times. Cells were then resuspended by electronic pipette in 5 mL DPBS + quenchers and pelleted at 3000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was frozen at -80°C overnight.

Enrichment of endogenous biotinylated proteins was performed according to previous protocols. Cell pellets were lysed in 600 μL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), with 1 × protease cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, catalog no. P8849), 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 5 mM Trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 10 mM sodium azide. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as whole cell lysate (WCL). Protein concentrations of each WCL were determined by the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (catalog no. 22660).

Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Pierce, catalog no. 88817) were washed twice with RIPA buffer and 1750 μg of each WCL sample was incubated with 120 μL of magnetic bead slurry in separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with rotation for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads were subsequently washed twice with 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer, once with 1 mL of 1 M KCl in ddH 2 O, once with 1 mL of 0.1M Na 2 CO 3 in ddH 2 O, once with 1 mL of 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and twice with 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer. Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 75 μl 3 × protein loading buffer supplemented with 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2 mM free biotin. 17.5 μg of each WCL and 25 μl of each streptavidin eluate (SAE) were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE gels.

Nitrocellulose blot transfer and Ponceau S staining were performed as described above. Membranes were blocked with blot blocking buffer overnight at 4°C, cut into strips based on MW, and incubated facedown into 500 μl of blot blocking buffer containing the specified primary antibodies (see table below) for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were washed 5 × 5 minutes in blot blocking buffer before incubation in 10 mL of secondary antibody in blot blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes were then washed again 5 × 5 minutes in blot blocking buffer before imaging with Clarity™ reagent (Bio-Rad) as described above.

HEK 293T cells lacking endogenous MICU1 were made using TALE nuclease as described previously 2 by targeting the 5′ most exon. After single cell cloning, colonies with a premature stop codon were identified by DNA sequencing and knock out was additionally verified by western blot. C-terminally FLAG-tagged MICU1 with or without a C-terminal APEX2 fusion was cloned into the pLJM5 vector 3 . MICU1 KO cells stably expressing MICU1-FLAG or MICU1-APEX2 (NM_001195518.1) were generated by lentiviral infection, followed by selection with 200 μg/ml hygromycin for three days. Compared with previous studies, we note that there are differences in cell types (HeLa 4 vs HEK293T 5 ) and splice variants of MICU1 used (isoform 1 4 vs isoform 2 5 ), though the two splice variants differ by only two residues which do not affect any interaction domains or the mitochondrial targeting sequence. Hence we do not anticipate the different localizations to arise from these experimental differences. Immunoblot of whole cell lysates was performed using antibodies from the following sources: Sigma (MICU1, 1:1000), and Mitosciences (SDHB, 1:2000).

HEK 293T cells were permeabilized in a KCl buffer (125 mM KCl, 2 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 10 μM EGTA,1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) along with 0.005% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM glutamate, 5 mM malate, and 1 μM cell impermeable Fluo4 (Life Technologies). Fluorescence of Fluo4 was monitored with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Envision plate reader. 10 μM CaCl 2 was injected at 4 s, resulting in about 1 μM free Ca 2+ . Relative rate of calcium uptake is reported using a linear fit of Fluo4 fluorescence from 50-60 s (n=3).

DAB staining was performed on transiently transfected or stable HEK293T as previously described 6 . For analysis of DAB activity by brightfield imaging ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), cells were grown on 7 × 7 mm glass cover slips placed inside 48-well cell culture plates. Cells were fixed on ice using pre-chilled 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in DPBS buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 minutes. All subsequent work was performed using pre-chilled buffers and reagents. Cells were rinsed with DPBS three times for two minutes each before addition of 20 mM glycine in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 to quench unreacted fixative. Cell were again washed with DPBS three times. DAB staining was initiated with the addition of freshly diluted 0.5 mg/mL (1.4 mM) DAB (Sigma; from a stock of the free base dissolved in 0.1 M HCl) and 10 mM H 2 O 2 in DPBS. After five minutes, the reaction was stopped with the removal of the DAB solution and the cells were again washed with DPBS three times for two minutes each. Cells were then imaged by brightfield microscopy. Acquisition times ranged from 50-100 milliseconds.

For MICU1-APEX2 EM shown in Figure 3E , stable cells were grown in plastic six-well plates to 90% confluency and fixed using room temperature 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in “buffer” (100 mM sodium cacodylate with 2 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4), then quickly moved to ice. Cells were kept between 0 and 4 °C for all subsequent steps until resin infiltration. After 30–60 min, cells were rinsed five times for 2 minutes each in chilled buffer, then treated for 5 min in buffer containing 20 mM glycine to quench unreacted glutaraldehyde, followed by another five 2-minute rinses in chilled buffer. A freshly diluted solution of 0.5 mg/mL (1.4 mM) DAB free base (Sigma) was combined with 10 mM H 2 O 2 in chilled buffer, and the solution was added to cells for 5 minutes. To halt the reaction, the DAB solution was removed, and cells were rinsed 5 × 2 min with chilled buffer. Post-fixation staining was performed with 2% (w/v) osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 min in chilled buffer. Cells were rinsed five times for 2 minutes each in chilled distilled water, then placed in chilled 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate in ddH 2 O (Electron Microscopy Sciences) overnight. Cells were brought to room temperature, washed in distilled water, then carefully scraped off the plastic, resuspended, and centrifuged at 700 g for 1 minute to generate a cell pellet. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 100%, 100%), for 10 minutes each time, then infiltrated in EMBED-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using 1:1 (v/v) resin and anhydrous ethanol overnight, followed by two changes into 100% resin before letting sit overnight. Finally, the sample was exchanged once more with 100% resin before transfer to fresh resin and polymerization at 60 °C for 48 hours. Embedded cell pellets were cut with a diamond knife into 50 nm sections and imaged on a FEI-Tecnai™ G 2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.
