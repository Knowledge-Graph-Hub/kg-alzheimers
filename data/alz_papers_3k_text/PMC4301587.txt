A rare mutation inUNC5Cpredisposes to Alzheimer’s disease and increases neuronal cell death

# Abstract
We have identified a rare coding mutation, T835M (rs137875858), in the Netrin receptor UNC5C that segregated with disease in an autosomal dominant pattern in two families enriched for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), and was associated with disease across four large case/control cohorts (OR = 2.15, Pmeta= 0.0095). T835M alters a conserved residue in the hinge region of UNC5C, and in vitro studies demonstrate that this mutation leads to increased cell death in several cell types, including neurons. Furthermore, neurons expressing T835M UNC5C are more susceptible to multiple neurodegenerative stimuli, including β-Amyloid (Aβ). Based on these data and the enriched hippocampal expression of UNC5C in the adult nervous system, we propose one possible mechanism in which T835M UNC5C contributes to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is by increasing susceptibility to neuronal cell death, particularly in vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer’s brain.

## Online Methods
All human samples used in this study have been included in previous publications 30 , 31 . All patients were recruited after providing informed consent and with approval by the relevant institutional review boards, and the study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Regardless of the source (NIA-LOAD Family Study or NCRAD), patients and families were required to meet the same study criteria 30 . The ADGC assembled a discovery dataset (stage 1, 8,309 individuals with LOAD (cases) and 7,366 cognitively normal elders (CNEs) as controls) using data from eight cohorts and a ninth newly assembled cohort from the 29 National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs), with data coordinated by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and samples coordinated by the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD) 31 . Written informed consent was obtained from study participants or, for those with substantial cognitive impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian or other proxy, and the study protocols for all populations were reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.

A pedigree ( Fig. 1a ) from a previously described cohort 30 , 32 with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of LOAD was selected for study and screened for known pathogenic variants in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT, GRN and TREM2.

DNA was available for 16 members of the family described in Fig. 1a . Samples were genotyped using Illumina InfiniumLinkage24 SNP array (5,913 SNPs). Using this SNP data, relationships between the individuals were verified by examining kinship coefficients between each sample-pair estimated using PLINK using “ -- genome option” 33 . For computational feasibility, this large pedigree was split into two subgroups using the software PedCut 34 and the ‘maxbit 23’ option. SNPs that showed Mendelian errors were identified and removed using Pedwipe software 35 . Parametric linkage analysis was performed on these data using Merlin 35 and a rare disease with partially-dominant inheritance model with penetrance probabilities: 0.0001, 0.8 and 0.8 and disease prevalence of 0.0001.

Whole genome sequencing followed by data quality control (QC), short-read alignment and variant calling was performed on an affected individual III, 1 ( Fig. 1a ) by “unchained combinatorial probe anchor ligation sequencing”, as described previously 36 . Agilent based exome capture and short read sequencing using Illumina Hi-Seq was performed on a second affected individual (II,5) from the pedigree ( Fig. 1a ). Resulting reads were aligned to reference genome using BWA 37 . QC of this data was performed using GATK 38 and involved removal of PCR duplicates, quality recalibration, and realignment around short indels. Variant calling was also performed using GATK. Variants from both samples were annotated for potential function using Annovar 39 .

An additional 863 samples selected from the LOAD family cohort 30 , 32 were genotyped for UNC5C T835M using an Illumina Golden Gate Assay. Family members of individuals heterozygous for UNC5C T835M were then genotyped via Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) technology, as previously described 40 – 42 . Primers available on request.

A total of 4 independent LOAD case/control collections were genotyped for UNC5C T835M. 1) A cohort of 78 APOE4+ cases and 67 APOE4+ population matched controls with no evidence of disease with a minimum age of 75 years and genotype was determined at UNC5C T835M from whole genome and exome sequencing data. 2) A previously described collection of 711 LOAD cases and 3,683 aged matched controls using KASPar as described above 40 – 42 3) A collection of 4,065 LOAD cases and 3,127 age-matched controls were genotyped and passed QC using the Illumina exome array v1.

The NIA ADC cohort, assembled by the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) included subjects ascertained and evaluated by the clinical and neuropathology cores of the 29 NIA-funded ADCs. Data collection is coordinated by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). NACC coordinates collection of phenotype data from the 29 ADCs, cleans all data, coordinates implementation of definitions of AD cases and controls, and coordinates collection of samples. The ADC cohort consists of 2,499 autopsy-confirmed and 1,748 clinically-confirmed AD cases, and 175 cognitively normal elders (CNEs) with complete neuropathology data who were older than 60 years at age of death, and 2,669 living CNEs evaluated using the Uniform dataset (UDS) protocol 43 , 44 who were documented to not have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and were between 60 and 100 years of age at assessment. Among cases, the average age at onset was 71.6 years (±9.0 years), and APOE genotypes were 0.1% e22, 3.5% e23, 31.6% e33, 2.8% e24, 44.3% e34, and 14.7% e44. Among controls, the average age at last exam was 76.6 years (± 9.4 years), and APOE genotypes were 0.7% e22, 13.0% e23, 56.8% e33, 2.1% e24, 21.4% e34, and 2.2% e44. Based on the data collected by NACC, the ADGC Neuropathology Core Leaders Subcommittee derived inclusion and exclusion criteria for AD and control samples. All autopsied subjects were age ≥ 60 years at death. AD cases were demented according to DSM-IV criteria or Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) ≥ 1. Neuropathologic stratification of cases followed NIA/Reagan criteria explicitly, or used a similar approach when NIA/Reagan criteria 45 were coded as not done, missing, or unknown. Cases were intermediate or high likelihood by NIA/Reagan criteria with moderate to frequent amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) Braak stage of III–VI 43 , 44 . Persons with Down’s syndrome, non-AD tauopathies and synucleinopathies were excluded. All autopsied controls had a clinical evaluation within two years of death. Controls did not meet DSM-IV criteria for dementia, did not have a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and had a CDR of 0, if performed. Controls did not meet or were low-likelihood AD by NIA/Reagan criteria, had sparse or no amyloid plaques, and a Braak NFT stage of 0–II. ADCs sent frozen tissue from autopsied subjects and DNA samples from some autopsied subjects and from living subjects to the ADCs to the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD). DNA was prepared by NCRAD and sent either by NCRAD or by the University of Pennsylvania and sent to the North Shore Medical Center for genotyping. An additional 12,789 controls were genotyped using the Illumina exome array v1.0. Genetic outliers were removed based on Eigenvectors from Principal Component Analysis using Eigenstrat (sigma >6) 46 . 4). 3,196 LOAD cases and 79,248 control individuals from Iceland (DeCode Genetics) were genotyped and imputed for T835M as described 47 .

Association and meta analysis of case-control data ( Figure 1d ) was performed using the function metabin in the R package meta using the default parameters, which apply the Mantel-Haenszel inverse variance weighting method for pooling 48 , 49 . Using this function we compared risk allele counts in cases and controls in the four genotyped cohorts and performed fixed as well as random-effect meta analyses.

A custom Taqman SNP genotyping assay for UNC5C T835M with two allele-specific TaqMan® MGB probes containing distinct fluorescent dyes (Probe1 - VIC CCCGTGACCGTGGTGA and Probe2- FAM CCCGTGACCATGGTGA) and a PCR primer pair (Forward Primer GGGAGAGGGATGCTGAAAGC and Reverse Primer TGCTGGATCCTGCGAACAC) was designed and used to genotype all 16 members of the pedigree ( Fig. 1a ).

UNC5C-IRES-GFP or UNC5C-IRES-DsRed vector containing human UNC5C full-length coding sequence was used as template for insertion of the T835M mutant allele using the Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies). Primer sequences are available upon request. Either βgal-IRES-GFP or βgal-IRES-DsRed was used as negative control vector. To assay tau release into extracellular medium, human wild-type Tau 441-amino acid-IRES-GFP was used.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS (Sigma), 1%Glutamax (Gibco, Life technologies), and 1%penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco). Transient transfections of HEK293T were performed using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics). HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type human APP695 were maintained as previously described (PMID:24069330), in DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS (Sigma), 1%glutamax (Gibco), and 1%penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco) and 400 μg mL −1 G418 (Cellgro ® , Corning). Transient transfections of HEK293 wild-type human APP695 stable cell line were performed using Lipofectamine reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).

HEK293T cells or primary rat hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4%PFA and 4%sucrose in PBS. The cells were permeabilized, blocked, incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (anti-UNC5C (MAB1005, R&D systems) 17 , anti-GFP (Aves Labs, Inc), detected with anti-mouse Alexa 568 and anti-chicken Alexa 488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and then mounted with Prolong gold medium with DAPI nuclear dye (Invitrogen). All digital image acquisition was performed using Leica software linked to a Leica wide-field fluorescent microscope (DM5500; Leica) and CCD camera (DFC360).

HEK293T or HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type human APP695 cells were plated into 6-well plates at 75% confluency and transfected as previously indicated. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were split into triplicate. 48 h later, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and Phospho-stop (Roche). Cell lysates were run on 4–12%NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE analysis. The gels were transferred using iblot (Invitrogen), and the respective membrane was blocked with 5%Blotto (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in TBS-T and incubated with anti-UNC5C antibodies (MAB1005, R&D systems) and anti-HRP secondaries (mouse-HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific), rabbit-HRP (EMD Millipore). Protein was visualized with Supersignal Western Dura extended duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Versa Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and quantitated using ImageJ software (NIH).

To determine cell surface expression of WT or T835M UNC5C, 293Ts cells were transiently transfected for 72 h as previously indicated. Live cells were removed from the culture dish with 5 mM EDTA. Subsequently UNC5C present at the cell surface was labeled with anti-UNC5C antibody, which recognizes the UNC5C extracellular domain (MAB1005, R&D systems), followed by goat-anti-mouse biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and detected with streptavidin-APC (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). Propidium Iodide (PI, 1 μg mL −1 , Sigma) was used as a viability marker to allow for initial gating on live, single cells.

HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type human APP695 cells were transfected as previously indicated. At 72 h post-transfection, the conditioned media was collected to assay for APP cleavage products, and cells were lysed using RIPA buffer with Mini-complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and Phospho-stop (Roche). Aβ x–40 and Aβ x–42 peptides were measured from cell supernatants by sandwich ELISAs. Briefly, rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the C-terminus of Aβ 40 or Aβ 42 (EMD Millipore) was coated onto plates, and biotinylated anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Covance, Dedham, MA) was used for detection. The 6E10 epitope lies within amino acids 3–8 of Aβ. Cell lysates were used to confirm equivalent expression levels UNC5C, βgal, and APP (22C11, EMD Millipore), and actin was used as a loading control for each individual experiment.

HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with a human wild-type Tau 441aa construct and βgal, WT UNC5C, or UNC5C T835M vector as previously outlined. The conditioned media was collected 72 h post-transfection and assayed for extracellular p-tau or total tau using the MSD 96-Well MULTI-SPOT Alzheimer’s disease assay with phospho-tau (Thr231)/ total tau with purified neuronal tau calibrators (Mesoscale Discovery). Cell lysates were used to confirm equal expression levels of UNC5C, βgal, and tau, and actin was used as a loading control for each individual experiment.

HEK293T cells were transfected as described above. Transfections were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C followed by trypsinization and re-plating into a 96-well plate at 1×10 4 cells well −1 . Each sample consisted of six replicates, and the experiment was conducted on four separate occasions. Starting at 22 h post-transfection, cells were imaged for GFP or DsRed fluorescence and bright field at 2–4 h intervals over a 44–64 h period using the IncuCyte FLR or Incucyte ZOOM live cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience). At 66 h post-transfection, total well confluency and GFP confluency were calculated over time using IncuCyte 2011A software (Essen Bioscience). The confluency for each sample was calculated by averaging 3–6 replicates containing at least twelve fields of view. To analyze specific growth of the GFP+ cells, GFP confluency was divided by total confluency for all time points and best fit lines were created. The slopes of these lines represent specific GFP or DsRed growth. The slope of each sample was then normalized to the respective control within a given experiment.

HEK293T cells were transfected as previously indicated. The next day, cells were serum starved in media containing 1% serum for 24 h to synchronize. Following this, fresh medium containing full serum (10%) was added to the cells for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested by TrypLE ™ (Gibco) and then washed with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. Next cells were fixed with ice cold 70% ethanol while vortexing and allowed to incubate on ice for 20 min. Cells were then pelleted and washed with PBS with 5 mM EDTA and 1% BSA. Next cells were treated with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween, 5% goat serum, and 2 μg mL −1 RNase (Sigma) for 15min. Following block and permeabilization, cells were incubated for 30 min with anti-UNC5C primary antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in staining buffer (PBS with 5 mM EDTA, 0.5%Tween, and 1%BSA) and then washed once with staining buffer. Cells were then resuspended in staining buffer plus goat anti-rabbit biotin (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After a single wash with staining buffer, cells were then treated with streptavidin-conjugated APC (1:200, Invitrogen) and 50 μg mL −1 PI (Sigma) in staining buffer for 15 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were washed a final time and resuspended in PBS with 5 mM EDTA, 1% BSA, and PI. Samples were analyzed on a BD LSR-II (BD Biosciences) for DNA content of the UNC5C APC+ population using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

HEK293T cells were transiently transfected as previously described. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by TrypLE ™ (Gibco) and washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 5 mM EDTA). Following this, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer containing 10 μM Calcein Blue-AM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 15 min. Cells were then pelleted by spinning at 1400 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and incubated in AnnexinV binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 pH 7.4) containing PI 1 μg mL −1 (Sigma) and AnnexinV-APC (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were spun down and resuspended in AnnexinV binding buffer with 1 μg mL −1 PI. Samples were run on a BD LSR Fortessa cell analyzer (BD biosciences) for the percentage of live, single, GFP+ cells that showed AnnexinV staining and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with βgal, WT or T835M UNC5C IRES-DsRed constructs as previously described for 24 h, the cells were split into 6 wells of a 96-well pre-coated poly-d-lysine plate. Caspase activity was monitored by the addition of Cellplayer, caspase-3 or -7activity, reagent (1:2000, Essen Bioscience) to the culture medium. Time-lapse images of HEK293Ts were collected on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a 20× 0.45 NA objective and Nikon Qi1 camera Nikon Elements software (Nikon Instruments). 293T cells were imaged at 1 h interval for a minimum of 44 h. Individual cells were identified and tracked over time using the Spots Tracking function in Imaris (Bitplane, Inc). Fluorescence intensities for both the red and green channel for each cell were exported to Excel (Microsoft). Red cells were tracked based on red fluorescent intensity and considered dead upon showing either green fluorescent signal or by loss of red signal. Data represents three independent experiments with six replicates and 24 fields-of-view per genotype for each experiment.

Non-isotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on 4μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using QuantiGene® ViewRNA ISH Tissue Assay (Affymetrix/Panomics) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Gene-specific probe sets were used for detection of Unc5c mRNA in mouse (VB1-14659) brain samples, with a probe set to Bacillus subtilis dihydropicolinate reductase (dapB) (VF1-11712) used as a negative control, and probe sets specific to mouse Ubiquitin C (VB1-10202) used as a positive control for comparing overall mRNA levels. Alkaline phospatase (AP) conjugated label probe was used for mouse samples, with Fast Red substrate for chromogenic detection, and hematoxylin was used as a nuclear counter stain.

A gene-specific probe set for detection of human UNC5C mRNA (VA1-14551) target region 503–3132 & 7910–8980, in GenBank accession NM_003728 was used on tissue samples. A probe set to Bacillus subtilis dihydropicolinate reductase (dapB) (VF1-11712)—target region 1363–2044 in GenBank accession L38424 was used as a negative control. A probe set to human UBC (VA1-10203) target region 342–1275 in in GenBank accession NM_021009 was used as a positive control to pre-select tissues with good RNA quality. Deparaffinization was carried out on a Leica stainer XL and after the boiling step in a Thermo Scientific PT module the slides were briefly dipped in ethanol and dried before assembling the ISH chamber for the Tecan platform. Warp Fast Red substrate (Biocare) was used for chromogenic detection, and hematoxylin was used as a nuclear counter stain. Hybridized target mRNAs were visualized using bright field microscopy.

Three adult age-matched Unc5c +/+ and three Unc5c −/− mice 18 were euthanized by CO 2 followed by cervical dislocation. Hippocampi, cerebellum, cerebral cortices were dissected. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from adult murine spleens and digested with ACK lysis buffer (Invitrogen) to remove red blood cells. Tissue was processed to generate single cell suspension, labeled with antibodies to cell surface markers: PECy7-anti-CD3 (Invitrogen), APC-anti-CD11b (Invitrogen), APC-Cy7-anti-CD11c (Invitrogen), FITC-anti-CD19 (Invitrogen). SYTOX blue (Invitrogen) was used as a viability indicator and samples with single channel fluorescence markers were used to properly set the gates for fluorescent- activated cell sorting (FACSAria, Beckton Dickson) and collecting live, fluorescent positive cells within each indicated PBMC population. Adult human whole blood was acquired from the Genentech Employee Donation Program. PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep ™ and SepMate ™ -50 tube (STEMCELL ™ Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), processed to a single cell suspension, labeled with antibodies to the following cell surface markers PECY5- anti-CD3 (Invitrogen), FITC-anti-CD14 (Invitrogen), AlexaFluor 700-anti-CD11c (Invitrogen), PE-anti-CD19 (Invitrogen), and sorted in a similar manner to the murine PBMCs samples. RNA was extracted from sub-dissected regions of murine adult brain or sorted populations of murine or human PBMCs, using RNeasy mini plus kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), cDNA was synthesized using cDNA high capacity reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and semi-quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers were murine Unc5c (Mm00494093_m1, Invitrogen), murine Trem2 (Mm04209424_g1, Invitrogen) murine β-actin (4352341E, Applied Biosystems); human Unc5c (Hs00186620_m1, Invitrogen), human Trem2 (Hs00219132_m1, Invitrogen), human β-actin (4310881E, Applied Biosystems).

Flow cytometry sorting of adult mouse hippocampi and cortex: both hippocampi or one cortical hemisphere per animal (n=3 matched pairs of Unc5c +/+ and Unc5c −/− ) was minced, dissociated with accutase for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were triturated to single suspension in Hibernate (BrainBits, LLC), passed thru a percoll gradient and then fixed on ice. Cells were blocked in Hibernate and labeled with primary antibodies: NueN-488 (1:1000, Chemicon), GFAP-PE (1:50, BD Biosciences), CD11b-APC (1:250, BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. DAPI was added to gate on single cells. The cell-specific sub-types were isolated by FACS and collected for qPCR analysis as described above.

The Animal Care and Use Committee at Genentech approved this study, and use was in accordance with their guidelines. Timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were euthanized by CO 2 followed by cervical dislocation. Hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 18 (E18d) rats and enzymatically dissociated using the papain dissociation system following the manufacturer’s instructions (Worthington Biochemical Corp, Lakewood, NJ). Dissociated hippocampal cells were placed in nucleofector solution with βgal, WT or T835M UNC5C IRES-GFP constructs and transduced using the nucleofection method with Amaxa electroporation (Lonza). Following nucleofection, the cells were plated on to pre-coated poly-d-lysine/ laminin plates in NB4Activ medium (BrainBits) supplemented with 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco). The neuronal cultures were challenged with: no treatment vehicle (DMSO) control, Aβ 1–42 (rPeptide), scrambled Aβ 1–42 peptide (rPeptide), glutamate (Tocris), or staurosporine (Sigma). For Aβ 1–42 , immediately prior to addition to the culture medium, lyophilized Abeta was resuspended in DMSO then diluted further in neuronal growth media. The neuronal cultures were incubated with Aβ for 48 h and processed for ICC to visualize the GFP positive transduced neurons. With the experimenter blinded to condition, within three randomly plated wells, ten fields-of-view were captured per well, the number of GFP+ cells were determined by ImageJ automated analysis. In order to compare across conditions and between experiments in which the number of GFP+ transduced cells varied between individual nucleofected vectors, the number of surviving neurotoxin-treated cells were normalized to their respective untreated vector controls.

Time-lapse live-cell imaging: hippocampal neurons were dissociated and nucleofected as described above. Cells were allowed to attach to poly-d-lysine coated 96-well plate at 37°C for 3 h prior to initiating imaging. Each vector condition consisted of three technical replicates with four-fields-of-view acquired per replicate and the experiment was conducted on six separate occasions. Five of the independent experiments displayed similar variation. One experiment experienced a technical error of remaining in neucleofector solution too long, and this experiment was discard due to increased variation within the experiment. Data shown was combined from five experiments that displayed consistent variation across experiments. Starting at 3 h post-nucleofection, cells were imaged for GFP fluorescence and bright field at 4 h intervals for 116 h period using the IncuCyte ™ Zoom live cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience). After 116 h of imaging, number of GFP+ cells per well overtime was obtained using IncuCyte ™ Zoom 2013A software (Essen Bioscience). The number of cells per well for each sample was calculated by averaging three replicates containing at least twelve fields of view per sample. To determine nucleofection efficiency, the slopes of the best-fit lines for each condition from 0 h to plateau were created. The slopes of these lines represent the rate of vector expression or nucleofection efficiency. To calculate ongoing basal cell death for each vector, the number of cells remaining at 116 h was divided by the number of cells present at 48 h. Survival of each vector was then normalized to β gal, to capture vector specific cell death.

All results are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean. For every in vitro experiment, all samples collected were included in the final analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using either a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-tailed T-test as indicated using Prism6 software (Graphpad). Data sets were tested for normality using D-Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. If data sets did not meet normality, then a non-parametric test was chosen to determine statistical significance. Differences determined to be p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
