# Title
Resolving the complexity of the human genome using single-molecule sequencing

# Abstract
The human genome is arguably the most complete mammalian reference assembly 1 – 3 yet more than 160 euchromatic gaps remain 4 – 6 and aspects of its structural variation remain poorly understood ten years after its completion 7 – 9 . In order to identify missing sequence and genetic variation, we sequenced and analyzed a haploid human genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing 10 . We closed or extended 55% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human GRCh37 reference genome—78% of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats (STRs) often multiple kilobases in length embedded within GC-rich genomic regions. We resolved the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the basepair level, including inversions, complex insertions, and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously reported with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kbp in size. Compared to the human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in regions corresponding to complex insertions and long STRs. Our results suggest a greater complexity of the human genome in the form of variation of longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the application of this longer-read sequencing technology.

## Methods
SMRT WGS sequence data (41-fold sequence coverage) was generated using a Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (P5C3 chemistry) from genomic libraries generated from a complete hydatidiform mole DNA (CHM1tert). Sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using a modified version of BLASR ( www.github.com/EichlerLab/blasr ) ( Supplementary Methods ); a bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify regions of structural variation and extensions into gaps ( www.github.com/EichlerLab/chm1-scripts ); corresponding sequence reads were de novo assembled and a high-quality consensus sequence generated for each region using Celera v.8.1 and Quiver v.0.7.6. Reads are selected for support of a variant if the mapping quality is greater than 20; a minimum of 5 reads are required to trigger an assembly. For the purpose of this analysis, we focused only on the euchromatic portion of the genome excluding pericentromeric regions (5 Mbp flanking annotated centromeres), all acrocentric portions of chromosomes, and subtelomeric regions (150 kbp from the annotated telomeric sequence). Repeat content of all SVs was determined using CENSOR 26 , RepeatMasker 27 , Miropeats 28 and TRF ( http://tandem.bu.edu/ ). The sequence accuracy of the assemblies and SV polymorphisms were inferred by comparison to 18 sequenced large-insert BAC (CH17) and 89 fosmid clones 8 , Sanger-based BAC-end sequence generated for CHM1tert (GenBank accession pending), and comparison to Illumina-based WGS sequence generated for human genomes 1 . We also generated Illumina NGS WGS data (41-fold) for comparison (GenBank SRP044331). For the chromosome 10q11 region, 125 CH17 BACs were identified and sequenced using a Nextera-Illumina protocol 29 . A minimal tiling path of 35 clones was deeply sequenced (300-fold coverage) using 1 SMRT cell per clone; inserts were assembled and an alternate reference was created using methods described previously 30 .

## Extended Data
a, Gap closures are enriched for simple repeats compared to equivalently sized regions randomly sampled from GRCh37; examples of the organization of these regions is shown using Miropeats for (b) chromosome 4 (GRCh37, chr4:59724333-59804333), (c) chromosome 11 (GRCh37, chr11:87673378-87753378), and (d) chromosome X (GRCh37, chrX:143492324-143572324). Dotplots show the architecture of the degenerate STRs with the core motif highlighted below. Shared sequence motifs between blocks is indicated by color.

At every variant locus, we collected the full-length reads that overlap the locus, performed de novo assembly using the Celera assembler, and called a consensus using Quiver after remapping reads used in the assembly as well as reads flanking the assembly (yellow reads) to increase consensus quality at the boundaries of the assembly. BLASR is used to align the assembly consensus sequences to the reference, and insertions and deletions in the alignments are output as variants. Reads spanning a deletion event within a single alignment are shown as bars connected by a solid line, and double hard-stop reads spanning a larger deletion event and split into two separate alignments of the same read are shown as a dotted line.

Chromosome ideogram heatmap depicts the normalized density of inserted CHM1 basepairs per 5 Mbp bin with a strong bias noted near the end of most chromosomes. Locations of SVs and closed gaps are given by colored diamonds to the left of each chromosome: closed gap sequences (red), inversions (green), and complex gaps (blue).

( bottom ) Extended examples of complex insertion events: ( dark blue ) alignment to chimpanzee panTro4 reference; ( light teal ) existing human reference hg19; ( dark teal ) inserted sequence. The bottom rows show repeat annotations, with darker hues for repeats overlapping the inserted region.

Inversions detected by alignment of single long reads were validated by sequencing clones from the CHM1 BAC library (CHORI17) whose end mappings to GRCh37 spanned the putative inversions. Inversions were validated by aligning the corresponding BAC sequences to GRCh37 with Miropeats. Shared sequence between the BACs and GRCh37 is shown in black while inversion events are indicated in red.

a, The clone-based assembly is composed primarily of BACs from the CH17 library as shown in the tiling path below the internal repeat structure of the region. Colored arrows indicate large segmental duplications with homologous sequences connected by colored lines (Miropeats). Genes annotated from alignment of RefSeq mRNA sequences with GMAP are shown. b, Miropeats comparisons of the 10q11 clone-based assembly against the corresponding sequence from GRCh37, with gaps shown in red highlights the degree to which the reference was misassembled.
