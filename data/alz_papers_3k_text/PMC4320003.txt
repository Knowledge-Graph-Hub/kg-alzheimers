IL-10 Alters Immunoproteostasis inAPPmice, Increasing Plaque Burden and Worsening Cognitive Behavior

# Abstract
Anti-inflammatory strategies are proposed to have beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease. To explore how anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling affects Aβ pathology, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV2/1) mediated expression of Interleukin (IL)-10 in the brains of APP transgenic mouse models. IL-10 expression resulted in increased Aβ accumulation and impaired memory in APP mice. A focused transcriptome analysis revealed changes consistent with enhanced IL-10 signaling and increased ApoE expression in IL-10 expressing APP mice. ApoE protein was selectively increased in the plaque-associated insoluble cellular fraction, likely due to direct interaction with aggregated Aβ in the IL-10 expressing APP mice. Ex vivo studies also show that IL-10 and ApoE can individually impair glial Aβ phagocytosis. Our observations that IL-10 has an unexpected negative effect on Aβ proteostasis and cognition in APP mouse models demonstrate the complex interplay between innate immunity and proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases, an interaction we call immunoproteostasis.

## Introduction
Altered central nervous system (CNS) proteostasis, characterized by accumulation of extracellular or intracellular proteinaceous deposits, is thought to be a key trigger of many neurodegenerative disorders ( Golde et al., 2013 ). There is considerable evidence that various assemblies of the aggregated proteins that form these inclusions can activate the innate immune system which, in turn, can contribute to the degenerative cascade. There is also growing evidence that alterations in innate immune signaling can play a key role in regulating proteostasis of key pathogenic proteins linked to neurodegenerative disorders (reviewed in ( Czirr and Wyss-Coray, 2012 )). We term this complex interplay between the innate immune system and proteinopathy, immunoproteostasis. In a contextually dependent fashion, immunoproteostasis can have positive or negative effects on the proteinopathy and degenerative phenotype. Because of these effects and the plethora of therapeutic targets in the innate immune system, there is considerable interest in manipulating immunoproteostasis for potential disease modification in neurodegenerative diseases.

Two long-standing and interrelated hypotheses in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field relevant to immunoproteostasis are that i) pro-inflammatory activation of innate immunity can enhance Aβ accumulation and thereby initiate or accelerate pathological cascades in AD and ii) anti-inflammatory strategies reduce Aβ accumulation and through synergistic or independent mechanisms could also be neuroprotective. We and others have directly tested the first of these hypotheses and found little experimental evidence to support it ( Boissonneault et al., 2009 ; Chakrabarty et al., 2010b ; Chakrabarty et al., 2011a ; Chakrabarty et al., 2010a ; El Khoury et al., 2007 ; Herber et al., 2007 ; Naert and Rivest, 2011 ; Shaftel et al., 2007 ). These studies showed that manipulations that skew innate immunity towards a pro-inflammatory state consistently reduce Aβ accumulation in transgenic mouse models largely by enhanced microglial clearance of Aβ. Other studies using pharmacologic and genetic means to suppress innate immune activation in similar mouse models have revealed conflicting results. Some manipulations designed to suppress innate immune activation appear to decrease Aβ accumulation and improve AD-associated phenotypes in these models, whereas others have deleterious effects and promote Aβ accumulation and worsen AD phenotypes ( Chakrabarty et al., 2012 ; El Khoury et al., 2007 ; Kiyota et al., 2010 ; Maier et al., 2008 ; Richard et al., 2008 ; Vom Berg et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, clinical trials with anti-inflammatory agents have failed to clearly show any evidence of beneficial effect in AD patients ( Breitner et al., 2011 ; Leoutsakos et al., 2012 ).

Given conflicting data on how suppressing immune activation can alter Aβ proteostasis, we explored the effects of Interleukin (IL)-10 expression in Amyloid Precursor protein ( APP ) transgenic mouse models. IL-10 is a key cytokine that represses excessive inflammatory responses and inhibits the effector functions in macrophages and myeloid cells by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine pathways ( Banchereau et al., 2012 ). We tested the effect of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV2/1) mediated intracranial expression of murine IL-10 in two transgenic APP models: TgCRND8 ( Chishti et al., 2001 ) and Tg2576 mice ( Hsiao et al., 1995 ). We find that IL-10 expression leads to increased amyloid loads, decreased levels of immediate early genes and synaptic markers, worsened cognitive behavior, reduced microglial Aβ phagocytosis, increased ApoE expression and its sequestration within insoluble amyloid plaques.

## Results
We generated recombinant AAV vectors encoding murine IL-10 . Transduction of HEK293T cells with the IL-10 expression construct showed that the IL-10 expressed from the AAV vector was efficiently secreted ( Figure S1A ). When primary neuroglial cultures were transduced with AAV2/1- IL-10 and then subsequently treated with fibrillar Aβ42 (fAβ42) or LPS, IL-10 suppressed both fAβ42 and LPS induced inflammatory immune activation ( Figure S1B ).

We next evaluated the effects of IL-10 expression in two different APP mouse models. Two independent cohorts of neonatal transgenic TgCRND8 (Tg) mice and nontransgenic (nTg) littermates were injected with AAV2/1- IL-10 or AAV2/1- GFP in the cerebral ventricles (ICV) and then analyzed after 5 or 6 months (Cohort A, Figure 1 ; Cohort B, Figure S2 ). We have previously shown that AAV2/1- GFP serves as an appropriate control for these types of studies ( Chakrabarty et al., 2010b ; Chakrabarty et al., 2010a ). Following delivery of AAV2/1- IL-10, IL-10 was significantly increased in the brains and plasma of TgCRND8 (IL-10/Tg) and nTG (IL-10/nTg) mice ( Figure S1, D-E ). In the CRND8 Cohort A, analysis of Aβ plaque burden showed that IL-10 significantly increased total plaque burden by greater than 50% in the hippocampus and cortex of CRND8 mice while Thioflavin S (ThioS) positive dense core compact plaques increased by ∼38% ( Figure 1A, B ). Biochemical analysis of Aβ levels in sequentially extracted RIPA, SDS and formic acid (FA) solubilized mice brain lysates showed significantly increased levels of SDS solubilized Aβ and FA solubilized Aβ in IL-10/Tg mice ( Figure 1C ). There was no change in RIPA soluble Aβ ( Figure 1C ). Both the RIPA soluble and SDS soluble mouse brain extracts were separated by PAGE and examined using the Aβ N-terminus specific 82E1 monoclonal antibody. Levels of 82E1-immunoreactive low-molecular weight RIPA solubilized Aβ oligomers were unchanged in IL-10/Tg and control/Tg mice (data not shown). In the SDS fraction, an 82E1 immunoreactive band migrating at ∼8 kDa was slightly increased in a select group of IL-10/Tg mice (asterisk, Figure 1D ). Immunofluorescence analysis of Aβ in microglia surrounding plaques showed increased Aβ accumulation within microglial cells in IL-10/Tg mice ( Figure 1E ). Notably, in the second cohort of CRND8 mice tested, we observed similar results on Aβ ( Figure S2 ). We further tested whether accumulated Aβ in IL-10 expressing mice lead to increased phosphorylated tau. However, we found no significant changes in endogenous mouse tau phosphorylation in IL-10/Tg mice compared to Control/Tg mice ( Figure S3 ).

We next examined whether IL-10 affects plaque deposition in another APP transgenic mouse model in a different experimental paradigm. 8-month old Tg2576 mice were injected in the hippocampus with AAV2/1- IL-10 or AAV2/1- GFP and analyzed at 13 months of age. Soluble IL-10 was elevated in the brains of AAV2/1- IL-10 injected mice (14.2±4.7ng/ml; 4.3× over control). Immunohistochemical analysis of Aβ plaque burden showed an overall increase of 43% in the brains of IL-10 expressing Tg2576 compared to GFP expressing mice without any change in Thioflavin S positive plaques ( Figure 2A, B ). ELISA analysis of Aβ showed increased GN-HCl extractable insoluble Aβ42 but no changes in Aβ40 levels and unchanged levels of TBSx soluble Aβ ( Figure 2C ).

We performed an initial series of studies to evaluate IL-10 induced changes in APP gene expression, its cleavage products or Aβ degrading enzymes. No significant changes in full length APP, CTFα, CTFβ or PrPc were noted in CRND8 and Tg2576 cohorts ( Figure S4A, C, D, E ). Endogenous mouse APP and Aβ levels were not altered in nTg mice expressing IL-10 or GFP ( Figure S4B, C, F ). Q-RT-PCR of mouse APP, BACE1, IDE and human APP transcript levels did not reveal any significant alterations in IL-10 expressing mice ( Figure S4G ). Although NEP mRNA appeared to be lowered in IL-10/Tg mice ( Figure S4G ), NEP protein levels were not altered ( Figure S4H ).

We assessed hippocampus-dependent contextual and amygdala-dependent tone fear conditioned (FC) memory in CRND8 mice (cohort A) ( Figure 3A ) ( Hanna et al., 2012 ). All mice actively explored the novel environment of the training chamber and spent <3% of the total exploration time on pauses or immobility, with no significant differences between the groups ( Figure 3B ). The immediate freezing response to the foot shock significantly differentiated the groups, and was lower in both IL-10/Tg (13.6%) and Control/Tg (25.2%) mice as compared to IL-10/nTg (40.3%) and Control/nTg (34.9%) mice, respectively ( Figure 3B ). The freezing response of males and females was comparable, with no significant interactions involving gender (p=0.377, gender × group interaction effect). The IL-10/Tg mice showed decreased freezing during contextual memory test as compared to the control/nTg and control/Tg groups, which indicates the decline in their contextual fear memory ( Figure 3C ). Control/Tg mice showed comparable context memory to the memory of nTg mice ( Figure 3C ). During the tone test, the groups did not differ in their exploration of the modified chamber during the phase preceding the presentation of the tone ( Figure 3D ). IL-10/Tg mice froze significantly less than Control/nTg and IL-10/nTg mice during the presentation of the CS tone, while Control/Tg mice showed a trend of lower freezing response than Control/nTg mice ( Figure 3D ).

RNA analysis showed that IL-10/Tg mice displayed 62.8% reduction in the c-Fos transcript compared to Control/Tg mice (NanoString mouse inflammation GX array; log ratio=-1.315; p=0.0250; Q-value=0.00913). No significant change in c-fos transcript was detected in IL-10/nTg mice compared to Control/nTg mice. RNA levels of zif268, a key player in neuronal plasticity and learning, is also decreased in IL-10/Tg mice compared to Control/Tg mice (log ratio=-0.97; p=0.00038; Q-value=0.00029). We further examined levels of the presynaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin, by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting and found that IL-10/Tg mice have 27.5% less synaptophysin than Control/Tg ( Figure 4A, B, C ). In addition, though phospho-PSD95 protein is unchanged in IL-10/Tg, total levels of PSD95 are reduced by 50% in IL-10/Tg mice compared to control/Tg mice ( Figure 4A, B ).

We investigated how IL-10 alters the immune milieu and Aβ phenotypes using i) immunophenotyping and immunohistochemical techniques and ii) functional assays to evaluate phagocytic potential of murine microglia and astrocytes. We analyzed how IL-10 affects the expression of M1 and M2 phenotypic markers in the CNS ( Gordon and Taylor, 2005 ) ( Figure 5A ). Quantitative RT-PCR of IL-10/Tg or Control/Tg mice and their nTg littermates demonstrate a significant increase in Ym-1 in both IL-10/Tg and IL-10/nTg mice compared to genotype-matched control mice. MRC-1, Arginase or TGFβ transcript levels did not reach statistical significance. None of the M1-specific markers (IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS) showed significant alterations.

No gross morphological changes in the microglial or astrocyte processes were observed ( Figure 5B ). Immunoblotting with cd11b and GFAP showed a trend towards elevation in the IL-10/Tg mice ( Figure 5C ). Using either GFAP or Tomato lectin staining, we found that the number of astrocyte nuclei or microglial nuclei within a predefined area of 100 μm diameter around ThioS positive Aβ plaques were also unchanged ( Figure 5D ). Similar results were observed in the Tg2576 cohort injected with AAV2/1- IL-10 ( Figure S5 ).

Next we investigated the effect of recombinant IL-10 following fAβ42 treatment of primary murine microglial cells. In contrast to the broad immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 on mixed neuroglial cultures, IL-10 showed mixed effects on fAβ42 treated microglia. For example, IL-10 attenuated fAβ42 induced CCL5, CXCL10, TLR1 and TNFα expression but augmented CCL2 and CCL8 expression ( Figure 6A ). We then examined functional effects of IL-10 on the phagocytic potential of primary murine microglia and astrocytes cultured in vitro ( Figure 6B, C ; Figure S6 ). Wild type murine microglia or astrocytes were treated with recombinant cytokines, followed by addition of pre-aggregated fluorescent fAβ40 or fAβ42. Flow cytometric and microscopic analysis showed that IL-10 treatment leads to decreased internalized fAβ40 in IL-10 treated microglia compared to vehicle treated control microglia ( Figure 6B, C ). Following 1 hour of Aβ40 incubation, microglial cells were chased for 24 hours in fresh medium containing no Aβ. IL-10 treated cells showed a trend towards decreased clearance of internalized Aβ40 at 1 hour (p=0.0533, 1-tailed t-test) and 3 hour (p=0.13, 1-tailed t-test) following ‘chase’ in fresh medium ( Figure S6A ). Simultaneously, IL-6 treatment resulted in increased fAβ40 internalization compared to vehicle treated microglia after 1 hour incubation ( Figure S6B ). In these studies IL-10 did not affect fAβ42 uptake by microglia at the timepoints tested ( Figure 6B ). Astrocytes are relatively resistant to Aβ phagocytosis under similar experimental conditions ( Chakrabarty et al., 2012 ). Flow cytometric analysis of fAβ40 or fAβ42 phagocytosis by murine astrocytes showed that IL-10 treatment does not alter Aβ internalization ( Figure S6C ) whereas IL-6 treatment leads to a significant increase in astrocytic Aβ internalization after 1 hour incubation ( Figure S6B ).

We used NanoString gene expression arrays to perform expression profiling of RNAs that are altered by IL-10. Of the 179 mRNAs initially tested, 21 transcripts were significantly altered, including chemokines and complement pathway genes (q-value < 0.05, Figure 7A ). In a follow-up study, we constructed a Neurodegeneration custom array composed of key inflammatory and proteostasis mediators, including genes most up-regulated in the Inflammation GX array and other known mediators of neurodegenerative pathways ( Table S1 ). Of the 240 genes tested in this array, we found that 140 genes were significantly differentially expressed in IL-10/Tg mice (99 up-regulated, 41 down-regulated, q-value < 0.05, Figure 7B, 7C , Table S2 ) and 47 genes were differentially expressed in IL-10/nTg mice (45 up-regulated, 2 down-regulated, q-value <0.05, Figure S7A, S7B, Table S3 ) compared to genotype matched controls. While the magnitude of change for common differentially expressed genes upon IL-10 expression is often greater in the nTg mice, the number of differentially expressed genes in Tg mice is significantly greater (p < 0.0002, two-tailed Z-test), indicating a more diverse effect of IL-10 in the Tg mice. Overall, the gene classes and pathway components altered most significantly in Tg and nTg mice were similar: chemokines (Tg:Ccl8, Ccl5; nTg:Ccl2, Ccl8), complements (Tg: C4a/4b, c3ar1, c1qb, c1qa; nTg: c1qa, C4a/4b, c1qb,), FcγRs (Tg: FcγR3a; nTg: FcγR2b) and immune signaling mediators (Tg: HLA-DRB1; nTg: Ly86, Ms4a6a, Ptpn6,Ctsc) ( Figure 7C , S7B ).

We used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool to identify biological pathways that are affected by over-expression of IL-10 in Tg and nTg mice. Differentially expressed genes were mapped to canonical pathways, which highlights individual immune and inflammatory signaling pathways that are most enriched for up- or down-regulated genes in both the Tg and nTg mice ( Figure 7D , S7C ; for a full list of altered pathways in Tg mice, see Table S4 ). Seven of the nine most significantly altered pathways we examined in the Tg mice included at least one directly overlapping gene with the IL-10 signaling pathway, supporting a role between IL-10 expression and downstream activation of these pathways. In the IL-10/Tg mice, pattern recognition and acute phase response pathways were the most significantly altered. In the IL-10/nTg mice, all the pathways affected have been classically defined as part of IL-10 signaling by multiple groups ( Sabat, 2010 ; Shouval et al., 2014 ). We further applied the differential rank conservation (DIRAC) method to quantitatively measure how network expression ordering differs within and between phenotypes ( Eddy et al., 2010 ); in this case, we included all measured genes in the analysis, as opposed to restricting the focus on differentially expressed genes as in IPA. Using DIRAC, we were able to identify multiple pathways in both Tg and nTg mice that were consistently reordered between IL-10 and control cohorts, such that these pathways could be used as statistically significant and accurate molecular classifiers ( Figure 7E ). Notably, the changes captured in these pathway signatures, especially among nTg mice, do not necessarily reflect pathway-level activation or repression in response to IL-10 overexpression, but often more subtle changes that manifest as relative changes in the expression levels of different components within a single pathway. In summary, we identified eight pathways that accurately distinguished between IL-10/Tg mice and control/Tg mice but were not significantly changed in nTg mice (100% of samples classified correctly by DIRAC) ( Figure 7E ; Table S5 ). The motivation of this study was not to develop classifiers; however, gene expression patterns within these pathways that accurately distinguish between IL-10 and control groups provide good measures of confidence for network-level differences. Moreover, these pathways represent networks that are potentially altered in APP mice uniquely in response to IL-10 over-expression.

Analysis of transcriptome changes in IL-10 expressing mice using NanoString array showed that IL-10 expression increased ApoE RNA levels in both Tg (↑1.7×, p=1.43E-06) and nTg (↑1.5×, p<0.05) mice ( Table S2, S3 ). We observed a similar effect on ApoE transcription in AAV2/1- IL-10 transduced primary mixed neuroglial cultures derived from wild type mice ( Figure S8A ). We did not find any significant changes in ApoE protein in sequentially extracted RIPA and SDS brain lysates of IL-10/Tg and Control/Tg mice ( Figure 8A ). However, increased levels of ApoE and cleavage products were found in the insoluble formic acid extracted IL-10/Tg mice brain lysates (↑3.87× compared to Control/TG, p<0.005), suggesting that IL-10 increases ApoE expression and alters its compartmentalization in Tg mice ( Figure 8B ). Immununofluorescence demonstrated that, as expected, ApoE was localized within astrocytes in both IL-10/Tg and Control/Tg mice ( Figure S8B ). In the IL-10/Tg mice ApoE immunostaining was also selectively increased within Aβ plaques, which is consistent with the increased ApoE sequestration in the formic acid biochemical fraction ( Figure 8C, D ).

To investigate whether ApoE can increase amyloidosis by directly affecting glial phagocytosis, we explored how ApoE conditioned media affects glial uptake of fluorescent Aβ. To recapitulate in vivo conditions, we transduced the astrocytes in mixed glial culture with either rAAV2/1- GFP or rAAV2/1- ApoE and maintained the mixed culture for 3 days ( Figure S8C, D ). Robust overexpression of ApoE was confirmed by Western blot analysis of conditioned media ( Figure S8C ). Microglia were then isolated from the mixed glial culture and phagocytosis of preformed fluorescent fAβ examined by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Microglial cells isolated from the ApoE treated culture and maintained in ApoE conditioned media showed a striking attenuation in internalization of fAβ compared to control microglia grown in GFP conditioned media (p=0.0027) ( Figure 8E , S8D ). Given the evidence for high affinity binding of ApoE to Aβ, we explored whether a direct interaction between Aβ aggregates and ApoE in the glial conditioned media might account for the dramatic effect on phagocytosis ( Figure 8F ). Pull-down assay using control aggregated amyloids ( Iconomidou et al., 2001 ; Wilkins et al., 2000 ), aggregated Aβ42 and aggregated reverse Aβ42 showed that ApoE binds selectively to aggregated Aβ42 but not to the other amyloids ( Figure 8F ).

## Discussion
In this study, we have directly tested the hypothesis that expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 would have beneficial effects in two APP mouse models. Rather than beneficial effects, we find that IL-10 worsens multiple AD relevant phenotypes in APP mice including amyloid plaque pathology and memory and learning. There was no evidence that the pro-amyloidogenic effect was due to altered APP expression or processing, nor were levels of key Aβ-degrading enzymes altered. IL-10 had a complex effect on innate immune activation status in the brain. IL-10 altered the innate immune gene expression toward a M2-like activation state. Simultaneously, a network based approach identified several inflammatory pathways, consisting of chemokines and acute phase reactants, to be upregulated in IL-10 expressing Tg and nTg mice.

Mechanistically, we can attribute the negative effects of IL-10 on Aβ proteostasis to a synergistic effects of decreased Aβ phagocytosis by microglia, increased endogenous ApoE expression and enhanced accumulation of ApoE in insoluble amyloid plaques (summarized in Figure 8G ). Our Aβ phagocytosis data, in combination with previous data with inflammatory cytokines ( Chakrabarty et al., 2010a ) indicates that IL-10 mediated alterations of innate immunity dampens microglial phagocytosis of Aβ in vitro. Additionally, ApoE by binding with Aβ aggregates, may negatively regulate Aβ aggregate clearance, thereby promoting further plaque deposition. Human APOE has been shown to have complex effects on Aβ. It promotes deposition of fibrillar Aβ, and in humans, can regulate clearance of soluble Aβ in an isoform dependent manner (reviewed in ( Liu et al., 2013 )). Human APOE4 carriers are not only at risk for developing AD, but APOE4 may also have negative impact on cognition in normal aging and AD ( Corder et al., 1993 ; Deary et al., 2002 ; Honea et al., 2009 ; Liu et al., 2014 ). Mouse ApoE is comparable to human APOE4 at residues 112 and 158, and numerous studies suggest that the mouse protein may have enhanced amyloidogenic properties ( Bales et al., 1997 ; DeMattos et al., 2004 ; Fagan et al., 2002 ; Holtzman et al., 2000a ). Knocking out both endogenous mouse ApoE alleles reduces Aβ plaque deposition in APP mice ( Holtzman et al., 2000a ) and even haploinsufficiency reduces amyloid loads ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Similarly, overexpression of APOE4 in pre-depositing APP mice exacerbates Aβ pathology whereas overexpression of APOE2 can enhance clearance of preexisting deposits ( Dodart et al., 2005 ; Hudry et al., 2013 ). In our study, the increased level of insoluble ApoE is plaque-associated, consistent with mouse ApoE functioning as a pathological chaperone promoting Aβ fibrillogenesis ( Bales et al., 1999 ; Holtzman et al., 1999 ; Holtzman et al., 2000b ; Wisniewski et al., 1994 ). This is consistent with our immunofluorescence and amyloid pull down data that mouse ApoE preferentially associates with fibrillar Aβ, suggesting that the behavioral and amyloidogenic phenotype induced by IL-10 can result from the accumulation of Aβ bound to ApoE and possibly neurotoxic cleavage fragments (( Cho et al., 2001 ; Jones et al., 2011 ); reviewed in ( Mahley and Huang, 2012 )). However, it remains to be seen whether increasing the ‘protective’ forms of ApoE (ApoE2) can result in an opposite phenotype in the presence of IL-10, i.e., binding and clearing Aβ. Thus, this present study demonstrates that a key anti-inflammatory cytokine exacerbated Aβ proteostasis and brain function by altering Aβ clearance and/or deposition. These observations are highly consistent with unpublished data showing that IL-10 deficiency in APP mice dramatically reduces Aβ load and other AD-related phenotypes, including lowered ApoE levels by RNAseq analysis (log 2 FC=-0.6, FDR=4×10^-5) (M.-V. Guillot-Sestier and T. Town, personal communication).

This data is also highly consistent with our previous but relatively limited study, showing that direct intracranial expression of IL-4, another key anti-inflammatory cytokine, results in Aβ plaque accumulation in TgCRND8 mice ( Chakrabarty et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, the data also agrees with our previously published findings that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ) attenuated Aβ plaque deposition and increased microglial Aβ phagocytosis ( Chakrabarty et al., 2010b ; Chakrabarty et al., 2011a ; Chakrabarty et al., 2010a ). Thus, in contrast to the long-standing hypothesis that pro-inflammatory stimuli promote Aβ deposition, we find the opposite - anti-inflammatory stimuli promote amyloid deposition.

In two recent studies, AAV-mediated hippocampal targeted expression of IL-10 and IL-4 were reported to decrease gliosis and improve spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice ( Kiyota et al., 2012 ; Kiyota et al., 2010 ). Moreover, IL-4 but not IL-10, was reported to attenuate plaque deposition in these mice. Given that our IL-10 data was reproduced in two independent CRND8 cohorts and in a hippocampal paradigm in the Tg2576 mouse model, and a robust pro-amyloidogenic effect of IL-4 was observed both histochemically and confirmed biochemically in TgCRND8 mice ( Chakrabarty et al., 2012 ), it is not easy to reconcile our observations with these previous reports. We would note that the group sizes in the Kiyota study are low, especially for behavioral analyses. Moreover, they do not specify gender of the mice, which can influence both behavioral effects and plaque loads in the bigenic APP/PS1 mice ( Wang et al., 2003 ). It is also possible the source of the discrepant observations could be attributed to the use of familial AD-linked mutant PSEN1 transgenic mice, as PSEN1 has been reported to have immunomodulatory actions in the brain ( Choi et al., 2008 ).

Although our own studies in this area have been internally consistent, a broader survey of published studies regarding alterations of Aβ and other phenotypes in APP mice via manipulation of chemokines, cytokines and other innate immune modulators suggests that a unified view of immunoproteostasis mechanisms in AD is not feasible at this time ( Czirr and Wyss-Coray, 2012 ). Manipulations, such as LPS, TLR agonists or astrocytic overexpression of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, that induce inflammatory glial activation reduce plaque load ( Herber et al., 2007 ; Scholtzova et al., 2009 ; Shaftel et al., 2007 ). Thus, coupled with our previous observations in IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF- α overexpression paradigms in CRND8 mice ( Chakrabarty et al., 2010b ; Chakrabarty et al., 2011a ; Chakrabarty et al., 2010a ), these studies suggest that at least with respect to Aβ related phenotypes, a pro-inflammatory environment may have beneficial outcomes. However, other manipulations that can have an anti-inflammatory effect have also been shown to reduce plaques and improve cognition. Notable recent examples include genetic deficiency of inflammasome ( Nlrp3 or Casp1 knockouts), deficiency of Mrp14 and loss of IL-12/IL-23 signaling ( Heneka et al., 2013 ; Vom Berg et al., 2012 ). Further additional manipulations, for example loss of CD14, CD40L, Myd88, fractalkine signaling, TGFβ signaling or overexpression of TGFβ1 can have complex and sometimes unexpected effects on AD relevant phenotypes in mouse models that can be challenging to reconcile with data from similar paradigms ( Lee et al., 2010 ; Lim et al., 2011 ; Reed-Geaghan et al., 2010 ; Tan et al., 1999 ; Town et al., 2008 ; Wyss-Coray et al., 2000 ).

Though genetic association studies have not reproducibly established the association of SNPs within the IL-10 gene with AD risk, the recent and unequivocal associations of SNPs within other genetic loci that encode innate immunity genes bolster the preclinical data that innate immunity has a significant role in AD ( Depboylu et al., 2003 ; Griciuc et al., 2013 ; Guerreiro et al., 2013 ; Kamboh et al., 2012 ; Lambert et al., 2013 ). In spite of a clear contribution of immunoproteostasis in AD, epidemiologic and clinical data largely focused on NSAID use and AD risk, reveal a fairly conflicted literature related to anti-inflammatory strategies. Long-term NSAID use has been repeatedly shown to confer protection in epidemiologic studies ( Szekely et al., 2004 ) but subsequent clinical trials with celecoxib and naproxen have not shown any benefits in patients ( Martin et al., 2008 ). Given that select NSAIDs can modulate Aβ production, inhibit Aβ aggregation and affect other cell signaling pathways, it is possible that any potential protective effect of these NSAIDs could be due to target engagement other than cyclooxygenase ( Lim et al., 2000 ; Weggen et al., 2001 ). A final intriguing observation relating to human NSAID use and AD is a report showing that naproxen use was associated with increased postmortem brain Aβ pathology ( Sonnen et al., 2010 ). Though other pharmacologic approaches that might have anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., statins and PPARγ/α agonists) have been reported to have potential therapeutic benefit in AD preclinical models, to date none have shown efficacy in clinical trials nor has the effect in preclinical studies been unequivocally linked to effects on immunoproteostasis ( Gold et al., 2010 ; Sano et al., 2011 ).

A striking feature of our study is the synergistic effect of IL-10 induced Aβ accumulation on fear conditioned memory and synaptic protein levels. As noted, IL-10 had minimal effect on learning and memory in the nTg littermates, but in the TgCRND8 transgenic mice, it significantly exacerbated context and tone fear memory, concurrent with marked loss of synaptic proteins. Although many studies suggest that soluble oligomeric species of Aβ are most often associated with various memory impairments in APP mice and humans ( Zahs and Ashe, 2013 ), in TgCRND8 mice we have seen a strong correlation between total Aβ loads and impairments in fear conditioned memory ( Hanna et al., 2012 ). Notably, multiple studies also show that increased insoluble APOE, both in humans and mice, is associated with worse cognitive function that is consistent with our observations ( Bennett et al., 2005 ; Nilsson et al., 2004 ; Raber et al., 2000 ).

The observation that IL-10 can increase ApoE expression and promote its co-deposition with Aβ has implications for AD therapy. There is ample evidence that promoting expression of the protective APOE2 isoform would have beneficial effects and APOE4 harmful effects; thus, we might expect that increased IL-10 or any factor that promotes APOE expression in humans may have genotype dependent effects. Indeed, in the context of APOE2 one would propose that IL-10 could be beneficial if its effect on APOE is dominant. In contrast given the intermediate amyloid promoting effects of APOE3, empirical studies would be needed to determine effects of IL-10 in the context of APOE3.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that IL-10 expression has a pro-amyloidogenic effect in APP mice leading to dysfunctional immunoproteostasis, impaired memory and reduction of synaptic markers. These data further highlight the complex role of innate immune activation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases where specific innate manipulations can have unexpected positive or negative effects on proteostasis and neurodegeneration.

## Supplementary Material
Supplemental Figure S1. Effect of AAV2/1- IL10 transduction in cell culture and mouse brain.

A. HEK293T cells were transduced with 1-2×10 10 genome particles of AAV2/1- IL-10 or AAV2/1- GFP for 72 hours. Media and cell (lysed in RIPA buffer) were analyzed for IL-10 protein levels using sandwich ELISA. Data is representative of two experiments. n=2/group, each sample tested in duplicate. ***p<0.001, *p<0.05, unpaired two-tailed t test.

B. Primary mixed neuroglial cultures were transduced with AAV2/1- IL-10 or AAV2/1- GFP for 5 days and treated with 10μM fAβ42 or LPS (100ng/ml) or vehicle (PBS) for 48 hours. RNA was collected and analyzed by Nanostring mouse inflammation GX array. A selected set of altered transcripts (mean±sem) is shown as fold increase over vehicle treated AAV2/1- GFP transduced cells. Both fAβ42 and LPS mediated upregulation of innate immune factors can be reversed by IL-10 expression. Data is representative of two separate experiments. *p<0.05, Q =0.05.

C. IL-10rb transcript levels were analyzed by Nanostring mouse inflammation GX array. n=3/group for 6 month old mice and primary neuroglial cultures (PNC).

Neonatal CRND8 mice were injected with either AAV2/1- IL-10 or AAV2/1- GFP in the cerebral ventricles and analyzed after 6 months. Representative anti Aβ mAb 33.1.1 (A), anti-ubiquitin (A) and Aβ ELISA (B) in this second cohort of TgCRND8 mice (cohort B) show that IL-10 expression leads to increased plaque deposition in the cortex and hippocampus, accompanied by increased formic acid extractable Aβ42 levels. No change in soluble Aβ (RIPA) levels was noted. n=6/group; ***p<0.001, Unpaired t test.
