# Title
A three-dimensional human neural cell culture model of Alzheimer’s disease

## METHODS
ReNcell VM human neural precursor (ReN) cells were purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The cells were plated onto BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)-coated T25 cell culture flask (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and maintained in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) media supplemented with 2 μg/ml Heparin (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 2% (v/v) B27 neural supplement (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 20 μg/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 20 μg/ml bFGF (Stemgent, Cambridge, MA, USA), and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin/Amphotericin b solution (Lonza, Hopkinton, MA, USA) in CO 2 cell culture incubator. The cell culture media were changed every 3 days until the cells were confluent. For 2D neuronal/glial differentiation, the cells were plated onto either Matrigel-coated 24-well or 6-well plates with DMEM/F12 differentiation media supplemented with 2 μg/ml Heparin, 2% (v/v) B27 neural supplement, and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin/Amphotericin b solution without growth factors. A half volume of the differentiation media was changed every 3 days for 3–7 weeks. DAPT, Compound E and BACE inhibitor IV were purchased from EMD Millipore, N-Lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) from Sigma-Aldrich. Hematoxylin QS from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA), and Amylo-Glo from Biosensis (Thebarton, Australia). SGSM41 is an aminothiazole-bridged heterocycle-containing soluble γ-secretase modulator (SGSM) similar in structure to those published recently 19 . SGSM 41 has the typical characteristics of this series of SGSM molecules that potently inhibit the production of Aβ42 and to a lesser degree Aβ40 while concomitantly increasing the generation of shorter Aβ peptide species such as Aβ38 and Aβ37. The structures and the detailed properties are included in Extended Data Table 1 .

The construct encoding full-length human amyloid beta precursor protein (APP695) with V717I ( London ) mutation was obtained from Dr. Oksana Berezovska (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; GeneBank accession no: NM_201414). The human presenilin 1 (PS1) construct with ΔE9 mutation was a kind gift from Dr. John Hardy (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA; GeneBank accession no: NM_000021). To introduce K670N/M671L ( Swedish ) mutations into APP695 ( London ) gene, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis using a mutagenic primer set, 5′-cggaggagatctctgaagtgaatttggatgcagaattccga-3′ and 5′-tcggaattctgcatccaaattcacttcagagatctcctcc g-3′ by using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). APP ( Swedish/London ) and/or PS1ΔE9 cDNAs were then PCR-amplified with Pfu (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and cloned into lentiviral polycistronic CSCW-IRES-GFP or CSCW-IRES-mCherry vectors to generate CSCW-APP-GFP, CSCW-PS1ΔE9-mCherry and CSCW-APP-IRES-PS1ΔE9-IRES-mCherry. The parental CSCW-IGs vector was provided by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) viral core ( http://www2.massgeneral.org/ncs/neuro_core_VectorDevelopmentandProduction.htm ). The primers used for the cloning were: APP, 5′-caccgctagccagggtcgcgaatgctgc-3′ and 5′-ggcgtcgacctagttctgcatctgctc-3′; PS1, 5′-caccgctagcagttgctccaatgacagagttac-3′ and 5′-gacctcgagctagatataaaattgatggaatgc-3′. The amplified APP or PS1 genes were double-digested with NheI/SalI or NheI/XhoI and ligated to either CSCW-IRES-GFP or CSCW-IRES-mCherry vectors. To make CSCW-APP-IRES-PS1ΔE9-IRES-mCherry vector, the APP-IRES segment of CSCW-APP-IRES-GFP vector were PCR-amplified with 5′-caccgctagccagggtcgcgaatgctgc-3′ and 5′-ggcgctagcggttgtggccatattatcatc-3′ primers, digested with NheI and cloned into NheI site of CSCW-PS1ΔE9-mCherry vector. All the newly constructed vectors were confirmed by sequencing (MGH sequence core. Charlestown, MA, USA). Viral packaging and the titer determination were performed by MGH viral core (Charlestown, MA, USA).

To transfect the ReN cells with the lentiviral constructs, 50–100 μl viral solution (1 × 10 6 TU/ml) were added to 85% confluent proliferating ReN cells in 6-well dishes, incubated for 24 hours, and washed 3 times to stop the infection. The expression of the infected genes was confirmed by mCherry or GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and WB analysis.

The infected ReN cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with Accutase (Millipore) for 5 minutes. The cell pellets were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% serum replacement solution (Life Technologies) and 2% B27, and then passed through a cell strainer filter (70 μm Nylon, BD Biosciences). The cell concentrations were adjusted to 2 × 10 6 cells/ml and then enriched by using FACSAria cell sorter (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA). GFP and/or mCherry channels were used to detect the expression of the transfected genes in the individual cells. The sorted/enriched cells were maintained in normal proliferation media.

Aβ40 and 42 levels were mainly measured by Human/Rat Aβ ELISA Kit from Wako (Osaka, Japan). The conditioned media from undifferentiated or differentiated ReN cells were collected and diluted by 1:10 or 1:100 with a dilution buffer provided by the company. Synergy 2 ELISA plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) was used to quantify Aβ40 and 42 ELISA signal. To simultaneously measure Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels, a multi-array electrochemiluminescence ELISA kit was used (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA).

5 ng of genomic DNA isolated from undifferentiated ReN-m and ReN-mAP cells was PCR amplified using TaqMan(r) probes for the two APOE SNP markers (rs429358, Cat. No.:C_3084793_20 and rs7412, Cat. No.:C_904973_10) using TaqMan(r) Universal Master Mix II (Life Technologies). DNA samples of known APOE-e4 genotypes (in duplicate) were used as controls to obtain the genotype clusters, and all the samples were PCR amplified on the CFX384 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA).

For thin-layer 3D culture, BD Matrigel stock solution (BD Biosciences) was diluted with ice-cold ReN cell differentiation medium (1:10 dilution ratio) and then vortexed with the cell pellets for 20 seconds. The final cell concentration for the mixture was approximately 2 × 10 6 cells/ml. The cell/Matrigel mixtures were immediately transferred into either Optilux Black/Clear bottom 96-well plates (100 μl/each well, BD Biosciences) or 8-chamber well Lab-Tek II coverglass plates (200 μl/each well, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) using pre-chilled pipettes. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C to form thin layer (100–300 nm) 3D gels at the bottom of the plates and the media were changed. The 3D-plated cells were differentiated for 4–12 weeks depending on the experiments; media was changed every 3–4 days. For thick-layer 3D cultures, BD Matrigel solution was diluted with the same volume of the ice-cold ReN cell differentiation medium (1:2 dilution ratio) and vortexed with ReN cell pellets for 20 seconds. The final cell concentration for the mixture was approximately 1 × 10 7 cells/ml. 400 μl of the cell/Matrigel mixtures were immediately transferred into tissue culture inserts (ThinCerts, 0.4 μm pore size, Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA) and then placed in 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, 1 ml of the pre-warmed differentiation media was added and the cultures were maintained for 4–12 weeks; media was changed every 3–4 days. For drug treatments, differentiation media containing either 1 μM BACE1 inhibitor IV, 1 μM DAPT, 3.7 nM Compound E or the same volumes of DMSO were added to 4–6 week differentiated 3D-cultured ReN cells and then maintained for additional 2–3 weeks. The cells were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or harvested for extraction and WB analysis

For paraffin embedding, 3D thick layer cultures were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature overnight. The PFA-fixed Matrigel was then transferred to a plastic Tissue-Tek Cryomold (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA), preloaded with 60°C liquefied HistoGel (Thermo Scientific). After positioning the fixed 3D Matrigel at the center, the whole Cryomold with Histogel/Matrigel was transferred on ice and then incubated for 15 minutes until the Histogel was solidified. The Histogel/Matrigel complex was then further fixed with 4% PFA at 4°C overnight, washed 5 times with PBS, and sent for paraffin embedding (MGH pathology core, Charlestown, MA, USA). The paraffin blocks were then cut into 10 μm sections (Leica SM2010R sliding microtome, Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), mounted on polylysine-coated glass slides (Thermo Scientific), then incubated at 45°C overnight. The sections were deparaffinized by 2 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each and then serially transferred to 100%, 90%, 70% ethanol solution for 1 minute each. The sections were then rinsed with distilled water for 5 min. For IF and IHC, the antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides for 30 minutes in Citrate-EDTA Buffer containing 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.2), 2 mM EDTA and 0.05% Tween-20.

For IF of 3D-cultured ReN cells, thin-layer 3D cultures were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 24 hours. The fixed cells were then permeabilized and blocked by incubating with a blocking solution containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween-20, 4% donkey serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% gelatin and 0.3 M glycine at 4°C for 12 hours. After washing with TBS buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST), the 3D cultures were incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking solution at 4°C for 24 hours. After washing 3 times with TBST, the cells were then incubated with TBST overnight by gentle rocking at 4°C and then further incubated with AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) overnight at 4°C. To avoid fluorescence quenching, a drop of anti-fade gold (Life Technologies) was added on top of the fixed/stained thin-layer 3D cultures before imaging. The fluorescence images were captured by Olympus DSU confocal microscope (Olympus USA, Center Valley, PA, USA) and the image analysis and 3D reconstitution were performed with ImageJ (a public domain image analysis software), IPlabs (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA, USA) and MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) software. The following are antibody dilution rates used in this study: 3D6 anti-Aβ antibody (1:500, a gift from Lilly), anti- β-tubulin type III (Tuj1, 1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-GFAP antibody (1:2000, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA; 1:200, Antibodies Incorporated, Davis, CA, USA), AT8 anti-phospho tau antibody (1:40, Thermo Scientific), PHF1 anti-phospho tau antibody (1:1,000, courtesy of Dr. Peter Davies), anti-tau46 antibody (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GluR2 (1:100, Antibodies Incorporated), anti-MAP2 antibodies (1:400, Millipore; 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-NR2B (1:100, Antibodies Incorporated), anti-GABA(B)R2 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), AlexaFluor 350/488/568 anti-mouse, -rabbit and -chicken secondary antibodies (1:200, Life Technologies).

For IHC, thin-layer 3D cultures were permeabilized and blocked by incubating with the blocking solution at 4°C for 12 hours. To block endogenous peroxidase activities, the cultures were incubated with 0.05% (v/v) H 2 O 2 solution in TBS for 5 min at room temperature, washed with TBST 3 times and incubated with the blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. After incubating with the primary antibody solutions for 24 hours at 4°C, the cultures were washed 5 times with TBST and then incubated with ImmPRESS anti-mouse or -rabbit Ig (ImmPRESS Peroxidase Polymer Detection Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30–60 minutes. The cultures were washed 5 times for 10 min each with TBST and developed by using ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). The following antibodies and dilution rates have been used in this study: BA27 anti-Aβ40 antibody HRP-conjugate (1:2, Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA, USA), BC05 anti-Aβ42 antibody HRP-conjugate (1:2, Wako Chemicals USA), AT8 anti-p-tau antibody (1:40, Thermo Scientific), PHF1 anti-p-tau antibody (1:1,000), anti-MAP2 antibody (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), ImmPRESS anti-mouse and -rabbit Ig HRP polymer conjugates (1:2, Vector Laboratories).

The thick-layer 3D cultures of ReN cells were homogenized with TBS extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 1 mM NaF, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific,), 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma-Aldrich) by using battery-operated spinning homogenizer (MIDSCI, St. Louis, MO, USA). After incubation on ice for 10 minutes, the samples were centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 × g to get TBS-soluble fractions. The TBS-insoluble pellets were then resuspended in 2% SDS extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 1 mM NaF, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated on ice for additional 30 minutes. The samples were centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 × g and the supernatant fractions were collected as TBS-insoluble/2% SDS-soluble fractions. The 2% SDS-insoluble pellets were briefly washed with SDS extraction buffer and then further extracted with 90% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice and centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 × g to get TBS-insoluble/2% SDS-insoluble/formic acid-soluble fractions. The formic acid fractions were enriched by using SpeedVac and neutralized by 2 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.3). Protein levels of SDS-soluble fractions were used to normalize the total protein levels in TBS and formic acid fractions. Puri3cation of sarkosyl-insoluble tau was performed as previously described 28 , 29 with modi3cations. TBS-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 1% sarkosyl/RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 2% v/v NP-40, 1% w/v N-Lauroylsarcosine, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 × g and the supernatant fractions were collected as 1% sarkosyl/RIPA-soluble fractions. The insoluble pellets were briefly washed two times with 1% sarkosyl/RIPA buffer, further extracted with 90% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice and centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 × g to get 1% sarkosyl/RIPA-insoluble/formic acid-soluble fractions.

15–75 μg of protein were resolved on 12% Bis-Tris or 4–12% gradient Bis/Tris gels (Life Technologies) and the proteins were transferred to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). For Aβ WB analysis, the membranes were cross-linked with 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution before blocking. WB images were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The images were captured by using BioMax film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) or VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad) and quantitated by using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 6E10 anti-Aβ (1:300, Convance), anti-PS1 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-a-tubulin (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CNPase (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-BACE1 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), C66 APP C-terminal antibody (1:2000), AT8 anti-p-tau (1:100, Millipore), PHF1 anti-p-tau (1:500), anti-total tau (1:2,000, DAKO), anti-MAP2 (1:500, Millipore; 1:200, Cell Signaling), anti-NCAM (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-synapsin I (1:500, Cell Signaling), anti-HSP70 (1:1000, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and anti-human mitochondrial antigen (h-mito, 1:500, Millipore).

Gallyas silver staining was performed with a modified protocol described by Nadler et al. 22 . The PFA-fixed thin-layer 3D cultures were washed 3 times with deionized distilled water (DDW) for 5 min and then incubated two times with a pretreating solution containing 4.5% (w/v) NaOH and 0.6% (w/v) ammonium nitrate. The cultures were then incubated with an impregnation solution containing 5.4% (w/v) NaOH, 6.4% (w/v) ammonium nitrate and 0.3% (w/v) silver nitrate for 10 minutes followed by washings with a washing solution containing 1 ml of 0.0012% (w/v) ammonium nitrate, 0.5% (w/v) sodium carbonate and 28.5% (v/v) ethanol for 3 times with 5-min interval. The deposition of silver particles was detected by incubating with a developer solution with 0.012% (w/v) ammonium nitrate, 0.05% (w/v) citric acid, 0.56% (w/v) formalin and 9.5% (v/v) ethanol for 1–5 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5% acetic acid.

The fixed 3D thin-layer cultures of ReN cells were washed 3 times with saline and incubated with 0.001% (v/v) Amylo-Glo solution for 5 minutes in a dark environment. The cells were then washed with saline followed by three washings with DDW. To avoid fluorescence quenching, a drop of anti-fade gold (Life Technologies) was added on top of the stained cells. The Amylo-Glo fluorescence was measured by Olympus DSU confocal microscope with Metamorph image analysis software (Olympus).

Bennhold’s congo red staining protocol was used for staining paraffin sectioned 3D cultures with slight modification. The hydrated paraffin-sectioned 3D cultures were incubated with 1% congo red solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min at room temperature. After briefly rinsing with distilled water for three times, the sections were dipped several times into alkaline alcohol solution (30% EtOH, 0.01% (w/v) NaOH) until the background was cleared. The slides were then washed twice with DDW.

Total RNAs were prepared by using RNeasy mini-columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Life Technologies). The pre-validated primer sets for neural markers were purchased from Real Time Primers, LLC (Elkins Park, PA, USA). The amplification was done in a final volume of 20 μl under the following conditions: 15 min at 95°C and then 55 cycles at 95°C for 10 seconds, 58°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds. The sizes of qPCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Biorad iCycler was used to determine Ct values for each sample. Gene expression levels were normalized against β-actin levels in each sample and the fold changes were calculated by setting the expression levels of each genes in undifferentiated control ReN- G cells as 1. The following are the neuronal and glial marker gene names and PCR product sizes: NCAM1 (neural cell adhesion molecule 1, 174 bp), SYT5 (synaptotagmin V, 171 bp), SLC17A7 (VGLUT1, solute carrier family 17 (sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter) member 7, 162 bp), GRIN2A (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate 2A, 170 bp), EAAT3 (solute carrier family 1, member 1 (neuronal glutamate transporter), 165 bp), ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase, 232 bp), SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4 (neurotransmitter transporter, dopamine), 213 bp), GABRA1 (Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor alpha 1, 165 bp), MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau, 206), S100β (S100 calcium binding protein, 157 bp), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein, 183 bp), EAAT2 (solute carrier family 1, member 2 (EAAT2, glial), 158 bp), MBP (myelin basic protein, 183 bp) and ACTB (β-actin, 233).

Relative levels of 3R and 4R tau mRNAs were determined by RT-PCR using the primer sets: forward 5′-AAGTCGCCGTCTTCCGCCAAG-3′; reverse 5′-GTCCAGGGACCCAATCTTCGA-3′ as previously described 30 . The PCR amplification was performed in a final volume of 20 μl under the following conditions: 95°C for 15 min, and then 30 cycles of at 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 74°C for 90 seconds with a final 10 min extension at 15 min at 95°C. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel: 4R tau, 381 bp; 3R tau 288 bp.

Sarkosyl-insoluble tau fibrils were prepared from FAD-ReN ( ReN- mAP (enriched)) cells, which were differentiated in 3D for 7 weeks 28 , 29 . 3D-cultured cell pellets were homogenized in 1 volume of TBS extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 1 mM NaF, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) by using battery-operated spinning homogenizer (MIDSCI). TBS homogenates were then mixed and homogenized with 1 volume of 2x RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 2% v/v NP-40, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation (18,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C), 20% w/v N-Lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) stock solution was added to the RIPA-soluble supernatant fraction to adjust the final sarkosyl concentration into 1%. After incubating at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1 hour, RIPA/sarkosyl homogenates were then centrifuged for 1 hour at 150,000 × g. The pellets were then resuspended in 10 μl of PBS (RIPA-soluble/sarkosyl-insoluble fraction). The RIPA-insoluble pellets were further homogenized in H buffer containing 10mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1mM EGTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% w/v sucrose, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 2 mM PNT (EMD Millipore) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min. 20% w/v N-Lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) stock solution was added to adjust the final sarkosyl solution concentration into 1%. After incubating at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1 hour, H buffer/sarkosyl homogenates were then centrifuged for 1 hour at 150,000 × g and the pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of PBS (RIPA-insoluble/sarkosyl-insoluble fraction). Both RIPA-soluble/sarkosyl-insoluble and RIPA-insoluble/sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were used for immunoelectron microscopy. The same protocol was used to enrich sarkosyl-insoluble p-tau aggregates in AD brain samples.

Immunoelectron microscopy was performed in the Microscopy Core of the Center for Systems Biology/Program in Membrane Biology (MGH, Boston, USA). The sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were resuspended in PBS, placed on formvar-carbon coated Ni grids and allowed to adsorb for 10 minutes. They were placed on drops of tau46 antibody solution (1:25, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hour at room temp, then rinsed on drops of PBS and placed on drops of goat-anti-mouse 10 nm gold (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) for 1 hour. They were rinsed on drops of distilled water and stained for 1 minute on drops of 2% phosphotungstic acid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Grids were examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA, USA).

Whole-cell recordings were performed on differentiated ReN cells with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and fire polished patch pipettes with resistances of 233 MO. Pipette solution was 140 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, and 0.1 mM Na 2 PhosCr, pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH. The external solution was 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. Command protocols were generated and data were digitized with a Digidata 1440A A/D interface with pCLAMP10 software (Molecular Devices). Voltage errors were minimized by series resistance compensation (80%). During the recording, 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was applied to isolate Na + currents by subtracting currents after and before TTX application. The data was analyzed by Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Sigmaplot.

All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Dunnett’s test. Data in graphs are expressed as mean values ± standard error of the mean (mean ± s.e.m). Error bars represent s.e.m.

Sodium currents are shown as subtracted currents. h. Premature ReN- G (<16 days) cells mostly showed voltage-gated potassium currents without TTX-sensitive sodium currents. i. WB of Aβ levels in the conditioned media collected from 6-week differentiated control ( ReN- m ) and FAD ReN ( ReN- mAP and HReN- mGAP ) cells. j. A table summarizing APOE genotypes of control ( ReN- m ) and FAD ReN ( ReN- mAP ) cells used in this study. Two APOE SNP markers rs429358 (minor allele=C) and rs7412 (minor allele=T) were used to determine APOE2/3/4 genotypes.

IHC of Aβ deposits in control ( ReN- G , left panels) and FAD ReN ( ReN- mGAP : middle panels; HReN- mGAP : right panels) cells differentiated in 3D thin layer Matrigels for 9 weeks. The fixed thin-layer 3D cultures were immunostained with HRP-conjugated BA27 anti-Aβ40 antibodies (brown, DAB (BA27); scale bar, 25 mm; arrows, large Aβ deposits). d. Amylo-Glo staining of ReN- G 3D cultures. Green, GFP; Blue, Amylo-Glo.

a. Elevated p-tau levels were significantly decreased by 1 μM DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor) treatment in 6-week differentiated HReN- mGAP cells. The antibody against human specific mitochondrial marker (h-mito) was used to show an equal loading of the samples. b. Quantitation of p-tau levels in control and DAPT-treated HReN- mGAP cells (**, p<0.01; t-test; n=3 per each sample). c. p-tau IHC showed p-tau positive cells in 3D-differentiated FAD ReN cells. Two p-tau antibodies, AT8 (pSer199/Ser202/Thr205) and PHF1 (pSer396/Ser404), against different phosphorylation sites were used. Brown, p-tau; Scale bar, 25 μm; arrows indicate the cells with high levels of p-tau. d. High magnification (1,000x) images of p-tau positive neurons (brown, AT8 p-tau). IHC of AT8 p-tau staining showed neurons with high levels of p-tau accumulation in soma and neurite-like structures (arrowheads). e. IHC of p-tau (AT8) staining showed the cells with p-tau accumulations in soma and neurite-like structures (arrow and arrowheads). f. An enlarged image of a dotted box in e (brown: p-tau (AT8); blue: hematoxylin). g. Total number of cells with high levels of p-tau in single 96-well was counted in control ( ReN- G and ReN- m ) and FAD ReN ( ReN- GA , ReN- mGAP and HReN- mGAP ) cells (*, p<0.05; t-test; n=5 for control ReN cells and 12 for FAD ReN cells). h. BACE inhibitor IV (1 μM) or Compound E (3.7 nM) treatments largely decreased cells with high p-tau accumulation in ReN- mAP cells (***, p<0.001; ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Dunnett’s test; n=3 for control ReN- m and ReN- mAP cells).

a. FACS sorting of ReN- mAP cells with top 1–2% mCherry signal. b. The enriched control ReN- m and ReN- mAP cells were differentiated by growth-factor deprivation in 2D cultures. c. The enriched ReN- mAP cells secreted high levels of Aβ40 and 42 after 9-week 3D differentiation. The secreted Aβ38/40/42 levels were measured by a multi-array Meso Scale electrochemiluminescence (Meso Scale SQ 120 system). Relative levels of Aβ (fold increases) were calculated by setting Aβ levels of the control ReN- m as 1. Aβ levels were decreased after treating 1 μM BACE1 inhibitor IV, 3.7 nM Compound E or 500 nM SGSM41 (**, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001; ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Dunnett’s test; n=3 for the enriched ReN- m and - mAP , respectively).

a. IF of AT8 p-tau and MAP2 in the enriched ReN- mAP and control ReN- m cells after 9 weeks of 3D-differentiation. A BACE1 inhibitor (BACE1 inhibitor IV) treatment for 3 weeks, dramatically reduced AT8 p-tau staining (green, AT8 p-tau; red (pseudo-colored), MAP2; scale bar, 25 μm). b. WB of total and p-tau levels in control ( ReN- m ) and FAD ReN (enriched ReN- mAP ) cells. The cells were 3D-differentiated for 9 weeks. 3 weeks of BACE1 inhibitor treatments significantly decreased p-tau levels without changing total tau levels. HSP70 heat shock protein levels were shown for equal loadings of each sample.

a. Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions prepared from 3D-differentiated ReN- mAP (enriched, 7-week differentiated), were placed on carbon grids, labeled with tau46 and anti-mouse 10 nm gold antibodies and imaged by using a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope (Scale bar, 500 nm). b. Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from 3D-differentiated control ReN- G cells (7 weeks). No immunogold-labeled filamentous structures were detected in these samples (Scale bar, 500 nm).

a. IF of p-tau and MAP2 in the enriched ReN- mAP and control ReN- m cells with or without treating 1-Azakenpaullone, a GSK3β inhibitor. The differentiated cells were treated with 2.5 μM 1-Azakenpaullone (GSK3β inhibitor) or DMSO for the last 5 days of the 3D differentiation (green, p-tau (PHF1); red (pseudo-colored), MAP2; scale bar, 25 μm). b. WB of total and p-tau levels in control ( ReN- m ) and FAD ReN (enriched ReN- mAP ) cells. The cells were 3D-differentiated for 4 weeks followed by additional 5-day treatments of DMSO or 2.5 μM 1-Azakenpaullone. c. Analysis of Aβ40 and 42 levels in the enriched ReN- mAP cells treated with either DMSO or 2.5 μM 1-Azakenpaullone (1-Aza) under the same conditions.

SGSM41 has the typical characteristics of this series of SGSM molecules that potently inhibit the production of toxic Aβ42 and to a lesser degree Aβ40 while concomitantly potentiating the generation of shorter Aβ peptide species such as Aβ38 and Aβ37.
