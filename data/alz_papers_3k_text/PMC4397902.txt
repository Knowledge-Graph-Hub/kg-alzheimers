# Title
The mouseC9ORF72ortholog is enriched in neurons known to degenerate in ALS and FTD

# Abstract
Using transgenic animals harboring a targeted LacZ insertion, we studied the expression pattern of the C9ORF72 mouse ortholog. Unlike most genes mutated in ALS, which are ubiquitously expressed, the C9ORF72 -ortholog was most highly transcribed in the neuronal populations sensitive to degeneration in ALS and FTD. Thus, our study provides a potential explanation for the cell type specificity of neuronal degeneration caused by C9ORF72 mutations.

We referred spacial expression pattern of C9ORF72-ortholog of mice brain and spinal cord from Allen Brain Atlas database 13 . Probes are made from transcripts of exon 4 through exon 11.

Target vector was designed in the National Institutes of Health Knockout Mouse (KOMP) project 14 . Briefly, Electroporation of C57BL/6N mouse ES cells with linearized plasmid DNA was carried out in electroporation cuvettes. Stable clones were selected in medium containing Geneticin. The ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to create chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous C9ORF72-ortholog knock-in mice. Postnatal day 60 male mice are used for the experiments otherwise particulary mentioned. Up to 5 animals are housed in the same cage. All of the experimental protocols and procedures were approved by the Animal Committee of the Harvard University.

Genomic DNA from ear biopsies was lysed in lysis buffer with proteinase K at 60°C for 12 h. The PCR contained primer set A (5′- ATCACGACGCGCTGTATC-3′ and 5′- ACATCGGGGAAATAATATCG-3′) which detect LacZ sequence and primer set B (5′- CCATGCTTACTGGGGAAGTC-3′ and 5′- AAGAAAGCCTTCGTGACAGC -3′), which detect deleted exon 4 and 5. Genomic DNA and primers (50 nM each) were placed in standard Taq buffer supplemented with 1.25 units of Taq polymerase for 10 min at 94 °C. After enzymatic amplification for 35 cycles, the PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer.

Mice were anesthetized with avertin and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Tissues were harvested and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, immersed in 30% sucrose for 24 h at 4 °C, and frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound for sectioning using cryostat. Some of the specimen from CNS are washed with PBS and cut using vibratome. X-galactosidase (X-gal) activity was assessed by incubating 10-50 μm thick sections with LacZ staining solution (1.0 mg/ml of X-gal, 5mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 2 mM MgCl2) for 30 min-12 h at 37 °C. The sections were examined and photographed with a Zeiss AX10. Antibodies. The following antibodies were used: β-gal (1:500, CGAL-45A-Z, ICL), ChAT (1:100, AB144P, Millipore), CTIP2 (1:200, 25B6, Abcam), CuxI (1:200, sc13024, Santa Cruz), NeuN (1:200, MAB377, Millipore), IbaI (1:200, 019-19741, Wako), and GFAP (1:500, G3893, Sigma).

Cryosections of tissue (10-50 μm thick) were cut from the brain, spinal cord and other organs, placed on poly-L-lysine-coated slides, air-dried, and pre-incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 % goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies, the mounted sections were observed using Zeiss AX10 microscope or Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Micro-Imaging GmbH). Images were processed using ZEN 2010 software. Stainings were performed at least three times and representative figures were shown.

Mouse and Human derived ES cells with HB9GFP reporter are differentiated and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) purified as described previously 16 , 17 . Briefly, human ESCs are incubated in accutase and resuspended in low-attachment flasks. ESCs are differentiated into motor neurons with dual-SMAD inhibition, and then retinoic acid (RA) and smoothened antagonist (SAG). Mouse ESCs were differentiated into motor neurons according to methods previously described 16 . For differentiation to motor neurons, mouse ESCs are cultured in medium supplemented with RA and SAG for 7 days. After motor neuron differentiation, GFP positive motor neurons are collected using FACS.

Following harvesting of RNA from indicated sources, RNA quality was determined using bioAnalyzer (Aligent). RNA integrity numbers (RIN) above 7.5 were deemed sufficiently high quality to proceed with library preparation. In brief, RNA sequencing libraries were generated from ∼250ng total RNA using the illumina TruSeq RNA kit v2, according to the manufacturers' directions. Libraries were sequenced at the Harvard Bauer Core Sequencing facility on a HiSeq 2000. Libraries were generated from at least 2 independent biological replicates and 20-40 million, 100 base-pair, paired end reads were obtained for each sample. Reference files of the genome build hg19 (human) and mm9 (mouse) as well as ensembl transcript annotations were obtained from iGenomes ( http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.ilmn ). Reads were aligned to the genome using the split read aligner Tophat (v2.0.7) and Bowtie2 (v2.0.5) 18 . Transcript assembly and isoform specific quantitation was performed using Cufflinks (v2.1.1). Abundance of individual isoforms is reported as Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM). Computations were performed on the Odyssey cluster supported by the FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field.

A 658 base pair fragment spanning exons 2-6 of spliced human C9ORF72 was amplified from a human whole brain cDNA library. Primers used were TCTCCAGCTGTTGCCAAGAC, AGTGTGAGCTGATGGCATTGA. For mouse, primers used were TTGGCGGCTACCTTTGCTTA, GTCTGCAGGTGTGAGCTGAT. The amplicon was purified, A-tailed, cloned into the pGEM-T expression vector (Promega), and sequenced. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense riboprobe was transcribed in vitro from the linearized C9ORF72 cDNA clone (Roche), purified, and hybridized to acetylated human spinal cord sections overnight at 65 C. After stringent washes in 0.2× SSC at 65 C, sections were probed with anti-DIG antibody directly coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Roche) for 1 hour, washed, and developed for 20 minutes with Cy3 tyramide (Perkin Elmer) in the presence of 10% dextran sulfate and 2 mM of 4-iodophenol (Sigma Aldrich). Stained tissue was then washed with PBST and mounted with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences).

Adult human spinal cord (70 year old, male) was derived from Upstate New York Transplant Services (UNYTS). The protocol was approved by Harvard IRB.
