# Title
Cross-tissue methylomic profiling strongly implicates a role for cortex-specific deregulation ofANK1in Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuropathology and cognitive decline. We describe a cross-tissue analysis of methylomic variation in AD using samples from three independent human post-mortem brain cohorts. We identify a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 ( ANK1 ) gene that is associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as significantly hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex) but not in the cerebellum, a region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, nor whole blood obtained pre-mortem, from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples from three independent brain cohorts. This study represents the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of AD employing a sequential replication design across multiple tissues, and highlights the power of this approach for identifying methylomic variation associated with complex disease.

## ONLINE METHODS
Brain tissue was obtained from three independent sample cohorts, enabling us to take a powerful cross-tissue sequential-replication approach to identifying DNA methylation differences in AD. Our discovery cohort comprised of entorhinal cortex (EC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cerebellum (CER) tissue obtained from 117 individuals archived in the MRC London Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank ( http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/cn/research/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank.aspx ). Ethical approval for the study was provided by the NHS South East London REC 3. Matched blood samples collected prior to death were available for a subset of individuals ( Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) as part of the Alzheimer’s Research UK funded study “Biomarkers of AD Neurodegeneration”, with informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki (1991). For validation purposes STG and PFC tissue was obtained from 144 individuals archived in the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease and Schizophrenia Brain Bank ( http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/neuropathology-and-brain-banking ) 19 and EC, STG and PFC samples from an additional 62 individuals archived in the Thomas Willis Oxford Brain Collection ( http://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/optima/information-for-patients-and-the-public/the-thomas-willis-oxford-brain-collection ) 20 . All samples were dissected by trained specialists, snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. Further information about the samples is given in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2 . Genomic DNA was isolated from ~100mg of each dissected brain region or whole blood stored in EDTA collection tubes using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction method, and tested for degradation and purity prior to analysis.

Power calculations for EWAS analyses are difficult given the paucity of existing data for brain DNA methylation and limited information about the extent of inter-individual variation occurring at individual CpG sites 9 . As we have previously discussed, studies investigating the role of epigenetic dysfunction in complex brain diseases such as AD are in their infancy, and no real precedents have yet been set about the optimal sample-sizes needed to detect them 9 . A conservative power calculation using methylome data from this and other ongoing studies in our lab 11 , 39 – 41 , suggests we are well-powered to identify DNA methylation differences of ~5% between groups for the majority of probes on the Illumina 450K array based conservatively on a case-control t-test with an array-wide Bonferroni threshold and the observed distribution of beta-value variances for the entorhinal cortex data set. More importantly, our study represents the largest cross-tissue study of AD using DNA from both affected and unaffected brain regions, and the first to employ a sequential replication design incorporating three independent study cohorts and two independent technologies (Illumina 450K array and bisulfite-pyrosequencing). The striking overlap between DMPs identified across our sample cohorts ( Fig. 2a ), and with those identified by De Jager et al . 21 ( Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. S2 ), suggests our study was adequately powered to detect robust AD-associated differences.

500ng DNA from each sample was sodium bisulfite-treated using the Zymo EZ 96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Samples were assessed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (Illumina Inc, CA, USA) using a Illumina HiScan System (Illumina, CA, USA). All samples were assigned a unique code for the purpose of the experiment and grouped by tissue and randomized with respect to sex and disease status to avoid batch effects, and processed in batches of four BeadChips. Illumina Genome Studio software was used to extract the raw signal intensities of each probe (without background correction or normalization).

All computations and statistical analyses were performed using R 3.0.2 42 and Bioconductor 2.13 43 . Signal intensities were imported into R using the methylumi package 44 as a methylumi object. Initial quality control checks were performed using functions in the methylumi package to assess concordance between reported and genotyped gender. Non-CpG SNP probes on the array were also used to confirm that all four brain regions and matched bloods were sourced from the same individual in the London Cohort and two brain regions in the Mount Sinai cohort where expected. Data was pre-processed in the R package wateRmelon using the dasen function as previously described 11 . Array data for each of the tissues was normalized separately and initial analyses were performed separately by tissue. The effects of age and sex were regressed out before subsequent analysis. For identification of DMPs specifically altered with respect to neuropathological measures of AD, we performed a quantitative analysis where samples were analyzed using linear regression models in respect to Braak stage (London N = 117, Mount Sinai N = 144) and amyloid burden (Mount Sinai N = 144). We used a two-level strategy for avoiding spurious signals due to SNPs rather than DNA methylation differences. Probes with common (MAF > 5%) SNPs in the CG or single base extension position or probes that are nonspecific or mismapped were flagged and disregarded in the evaluation of our results 45 . In order to also clean up rarer SNPs whilst discarding minimum data, within each tissue, and for each probe, we discarded beta values lying more than four times the interquartile range from the mean; these extreme outliers are generally the result of polymorphisms. Data was analyzed separately in each brain region using linear regression with probes ranked according to P value, and Q-Q plots assessed to check for P value inflation (see Supplementary Fig. S5 for example). To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified spatially correlated P values within our data using the Python module comb-p 18 to group ≥4 spatially correlated CpGs within a 500bp sliding window. The CETS package in R 17 was used to check whether our top-ranked DMPs were mediated by the effect of differential neuronal cell proportions across samples. To identify probes with consistent associations between Braak stage and methylation across the three cortical regions, we employed a meta-analysis of EC, STG and PFC. P values from the individual region results for each site were generated using Fisher’s method and (as a way of controlling for the covariance of the samples which come from the same individuals) Brown’s method. Raw data has been deposited in GEO under accession number GSE43414.

Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNA methylation across eight individual ANK1 CpG sites, including cg05066959 and cg11823178, spanning from 41519302 to 41519420 within chromosome 8 (hg19). A single amplicon (246bp) was amplified using primers designed using the PyroMark Assay Design software 2.0 (Qiagen, UK) ( Supplementary Table 11a ), and sequenced using two sequencing primers to maximize coverage across eight CpG sites. DNA methylation was quantified in 62 samples within the Oxford replication cohort using the Pyromark Q24 system (Qiagen, UK) following the manufacturer’s standard instructions and the Pyro Q24 CpG 2.0.6 software. Data was adjusted for the effects of age and sex. An analysis was performed to compare samples with Braak scores 0-II to samples with Braak scores V-VI at a) individual CpGs and b) amplicon-averaged DNA methylation.

A subset of samples from the London cohort was selected for RNA analyses. RNA was extracted from 30mg brain tissue using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit and those with a concentration >90ng/ul and a RNA integrity number (RIN) >7 (N = 36) were used for subsequent qRT-PCR (see Supplementary Table S2 for specific samples used in this analysis). 20μl cDNA was synthesized from 1300ng total RNA using the SuperScript® VILO™ cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and diluted five to tenfold for PCR, depending on the downstream assay. Off the shelf TaqMan® Gene Expression assays (Life Technologies) were purchased for the five housekeeping genes (EIF4A2, GAPDH, ACTB, SF3A1, UBC) identified as being most stably expressed in the brain using GeNORM (Primer Design, Southampton, UK). At least ten known protein coding splice variants for ANK1 have been characterized ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), and we were able to design three custom TaqMan® Gene Expression assays to target (a) variants 1,2,3 and 4, (b) variants 5, 7 and 10, and (c) variant 9 ( Supplementary Table S11b ). qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan® Gene Expression Mastermix (Life Technologies) for each sample in duplicate on an ABI7900HT according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The abundance of ANK1 transcript variants was determined by relative quantification to the geometric mean of the five housekeeping genes. Data was adjusted for the effect of age and sex and linear models used to analyze variant levels with respect to Braak score.
