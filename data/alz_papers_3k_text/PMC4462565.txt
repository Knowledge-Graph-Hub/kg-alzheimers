Structural
Insight into an Alzheimer’s Brain-Derived
Spherical Assembly of Amyloid β by Solid-State NMR

# Abstract
 Accumulating
evidence suggests that various neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are linked to
cytotoxic diffusible aggregates of amyloid proteins, which are metastable
intermediate species in protein misfolding. This study presents the
first site-specific structural study on an intermediate called amylospheroid
(ASPD), an AD-derived neurotoxin composed of oligomeric amyloid-β
(Aβ). Electron microscopy and immunological analyses using ASPD-specific
“conformational” antibodies established synthetic ASPD
for the 42-residue Aβ(1–42) as an excellent structural/morphological
analogue of native ASPD extracted from AD patients, the level of which
correlates with the severity of AD. 13 C solid-state NMR
analyses of approximately 20 residues and interstrand distances demonstrated
that the synthetic ASPD is made of a homogeneous single conformer
containing parallel β-sheets. These results provide profound
insight into the native ASPD, indicating that Aβ is likely to
self-assemble into the toxic intermediate with β-sheet structures
in AD brains. This approach can be applied to various intermediates
relevant to amyloid diseases.

## Materials and Methods
Aβ(1–42) was synthesized
and purified as previously described using solid-phase synthesis with
standard Fmoc synthesis and cleavage protocols as well as HPLC purification. 1 , 22 Further details are available in the SI .

The SSNMR experiments were performed following the established
procedures used for amyloid intermediates of Aβ(1–40). 6 All of the SSNMR experiments were performed with
a Varian Infinity-plus or Bruker Avance III SSNMR spectrometer using
a home-built 2.5 mm triple-resonance MAS probe at 9.4 T ( 1 H frequency of 400.2 MHz). In the 2D 13 C/ 13 C correlation experiments with DARR mixing 26 shown in Figure 2 , 1.8–3.5 mg samples
of isotope-labeled Aβ(1–42) ASPD were used. Other details
are in the SI .

The Bioethics Committees
of Kyoto University, Institute of Biomedical
Research and Innovation, and Niigata University approved all experiments
using human subjects. The native ASPDs were collected from concentrated
human brain extracts by immunoisolation using the ASPD-specific
haASD1 antibody as previously described. 22 , 24 The reactivity of ASPDs with antibodies was estimated by dot blotting
using a method previously described. 22 , 24 The details,
including the preparation of the brain extract, are provided in the SI .

The nanoscale morphology of the samples
was observed by TEM using
a JEM-1010 instrument (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 100 kV and
magnification of 80 000 as previously described. 22 Other details, including
the grid preparation and image analysis, are found in the SI .
