# Title
β-amyloid disrupts human NREM slow waves and related hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation

# Abstract
Independent evidence associates β-amyloid pathology with both
NREM sleep disruption and memory impairment in older adults. However, whether
the influence of β-amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory is,
in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and associated
overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here, we show that β-amyloid
burden within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is significantly correlated with
the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM SWA
generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory consolidation
and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Furthermore,
structural equation models revealed that the association between mPFC
β-amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory
consolidation is not direct, but instead, statistically depends on the
intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking β-amyloid
pathology with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a
novel mechanistic pathway through which β-amyloid pathology may
contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly.

## Introduction
Cognitive decline is a problematic and disabling consequence of aging, with
impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory being one of the most debilitating
symptoms 1 – 4 . The accumulation of cortical
β-amyloid (Aβ) and subcortical tau proteins within the brain are
leading candidate mechanisms underlying hippocampus-dependent memory impairment in
aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 2 – 5 . While tau
pathology predominantly accumulates initially within medial temporal lobe
structures, including the hippocampus 3 , 5 , β-amyloid pathology
predominates in cortex, with the earliest deposition including cortical regions such
as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 2 , 4 . Evidence implicates both
pathologies in memory failure in even healthy older adults 3 , 5 , 6 . Though tau pathology appears to
exert its influence on memory through direct degeneration of hippocampal
synapses 5 , the mechanisms
through which Aβ compromises hippocampus-dependent memory remain unclear.
Aβ pathology does not aggregate substantively within the
hippocampus 2 , 3 , but has been associated with memory through
its effects on hippocampal-neocortical network structure, function, and
connectivity 6 , 7 , and through its association with hippocampal
tau pathology 5 . However, since the
direct influence of Aβ and tau neuropathology explains only a moderate
proportion of the variance in age-related cognitive decline 1 , it remains possible that Aβ
pathology also impacts hippocampus-dependent memory indirectly, through other
pathways that impact memory-relevant hippocampal-neocortical functioning.

One novelpathway through which cortical Aβ may trigger
hippocampus-dependent memory deficits is through its disruption of non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep and associated slow wave activity (SWA) 8 – 11 . Several independent lines of evidence support this hypothesis.
First, older adults exhibit marked reductions in NREM SWA, with these reductions
being associated with the degree of memory impairment observed 8 – 13 . Second, the degree of disrupted prefrontal NREM SWA in older
adults is associated not only with the degree of impaired overnight memory
retention 11 , but is
further associated with persistent retrieval-related hippocampal activation that
reflects impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation 11 . Third, experimentally increasing
NREM SWA, particularly in the slow <1Hz frequency range, causally enhances
subsequent consolidation and thus long-term memory retention in young
adults 14 . Fourth, there is
strong homology between source generators of NREM slow wave oscillations, which
predominate in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 15 , and the cortical regions where Aβ preferentially
aggregates in both cognitively normal older adults and Alzheimer’s disease
patients 2 , 15 . Fifth, age-related NREM slow wave sleep
disruption is exacerbated early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease and
mild cognitive impairment; groups known to have elevated Aβ burden 13 , 16 , 17 , with these NREM
sleep disruptions predicting the severity of observed memory impairment 13 , 18 . Finally, recent studies in humans and rodents demonstrate
that interstitial Aβ levels rise and fall with the brain states of wake and
NREM sleep, respectively. Indeed, shorter NREM sleep duration and greater NREM sleep
fragmentation has been reported in mice over-expressing Aβ
proteins 19 , 20 , while human subjective reports of reduced
sleep duration and diminished sleep quality correlate with cortical Aβ
burden in healthy older adults 21 .
Moreover, direct manipulations of sleep and Aβ production in rodent models
of AD have established bidirectional relationships between both factors 19 , 20 , 22 .

Together, these data generate the untested hypothesis that the severity of
local Aβ accumulation within mPFC is significantly associated with
diminished NREM slow wave activity that, in turn, further correlates with the extent
of impaired overnight hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation in older adults.
Here, we test this hypothesis by combining [ 11 C]PIB PET
scanning, offering in vivo estimates of regional Aβ burden,
together with an experimental night of sleep electroencephalography (EEG) recording,
and a behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) test of
sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Utilizing these methods, we hypothesized that
the accumulation of Aβ within the mPFC would be associated with disrupted
memory retention through its association with NREM slow wave activity. Specifically,
we predicted that mPFC Aβ burden would significantly correlate with severity
of disrupted NREM slow wave activity, particularly in the 0.6–1Hz range
known to promote memory consolidation 14 , 23 . Second, we hypothesized
that such disruption in NREM SWA would correlate with the degree of impaired
overnight memory retention and persistent reliance (rather than progressive
independence) of post-sleep retrieval on hippocampal activity. Third, bridging these
relationships, we posited that the association between mPFC β-amyloid
pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory was not direct (i.e.,
independent of sleep), but instead, significantly accounted for by the intermediary
factor of diminished NREM SWA.

## Results
In short (see Methods ), twenty-six cognitively normal older
adults ( Table 1 ) received a PIB-PET scan, and
performed a sleep-dependent episodic associative (word-pair) task before and after a
night of polysomnographically (PSG) recorded sleep, with next-day retrieval-related
brain activity measured using functional MRI (fMRI). For the memory test, all
participants were initially trained to criterion on a set of word pairs in the
evening, pre-sleep, followed by two separate recognition memory tests. The first
(“short delay”) recognition memory test occurred 10 minutes after
the initial study session, where a subset of the studied word pairs were tested.

Following the short delay recognition test, participants were given the in
laboratory 8 hour sleep recording period in accordance with habitual sleep-wake
habits. The next morning, participants performed the second (“long
delay”) post-sleep recognition test during an fMRI scanning session, where
the remaining subset of originally studied word pairs were tested. Functional MRI
scanning was employed to assess post-sleep retrieval-related activity, focused a priori on the hippocampus 24 . The measure of overnight memory retention was calculated
by subtracting short delay recognition performance from long delay recognition
performance 8 , 11 .

Given our hypothesized associations between Aβ pathology, NREM
slow wave sleep and episodic memory retention, we first examined associations
between mPFC NREM SWA (mean at FZ and CZ derivations) and Aβ pathology
(the latter indexed using PIB-PET distribution volume ratios; DVRs) ( Fig. 1a–d ). Because of the causal
role of lower frequency (<1Hz) NREM SWA in memory consolidation 14 , 23 , we first examined the impact of Aβ on NREM SWA
by frequency. A two-way, repeated measures ANCOVA, with frequency
[0.6–1Hz/1–4Hz] as a within subjects factor and
mPFC PIB as a between subjects covariate, revealed a significant
frequency×mPFC PIB interaction ( P =0.032; Fig. 2a ). Specifically, greater mPFC PIB DVR
was associated with lower NREM SWA in the 0.6–1Hz range (parameter
estimate t=−2.29, P =0.031), but not
within the faster frequency range NREM SWA (1–4Hz: parameter estimate
t=1.85, P =0.076) over prefrontal cortex. The
proportion of mPFC SWA 0.6–1Hz was also negatively associated with mPFC
PIB (r=−0.45, P =0.020; Fig. 2b ). Moreover, the relationship between mPFC PIB
and proportion of mPFC NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz persisted when accounting for
the non-normal distribution of PIB DVRs by utilizing nonparametric analysis
(Kendall’s τ=−0.30, P =0.035). Indicating specificity, no other significant
NREM sleep associations were detected ( Supplementary Table 1 ).

These Aβ pathology associations remained significant when
accounting for the factors of age, mPFC grey matter volume (optimized voxel
based morphometry measure), and gender within the same statistical model
( P =0.026 for mPFC PIB, yet P =0.753 for age, P =0.781 for
grey matter, and P =0.660 for gender). While an
exploration of gender was not part of the primary hypotheses, the latter
non-significant effect should be appreciated cautiously, since the design and
power of the study is not adequate to discount potential gender
interactions.

To address the mPFC specificity of our PIB DVR and NREM SWA
0.6–1Hz associations, two-way, repeated measures ANCOVA models were
employed. In the first model we examine whether SWA at different derivations was
associated with mPFC PIB DVRs. In this model, mPFC PIB was included as a between
subjects covariate with location of proportion of NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz
included as a within subjects factor
[mPFC/dlPFC/Parietal/Temporal/Occipital]. In this model,
Location (F=24.002, P <0.001) and
Location×mPFC PIB DVR (F=2.568, P =0.043) were significant whereas mPFC PIB DVR was not
(F=3.871, P =0.061). Parameter estimates from
this model suggested that only frontal ‘locations’ were
significantly associated with mPFC PIB DVR, with peak significance being
detected over mPFC (for mPFC P =0.020; for dlPFC P =0.027; with non-significant associations for
Parietal P =0.118, Temporal P =0.105 and Occipital P =0.162
locations). In the second ANCOVA model, the proportion of mPFC SWA
0.6–1Hz was included as a between subjects covariate with location of
PIB DVR included as a within subjects factor
[mPFC/dlPFC/Parietal/Temporal/Occipital]. In this model,
Location (F=8.331, P <0.001) and
Location×Proportion of mPFC SWA 0.6–1Hz (F=6.219, P <0.001) were significant, whereas the Proportion of
mPFC SWA 0.6–1Hz was a trend (F=4.084, P =0.055). Thus, parameter estimates from this model
suggested that only frontal regions were significantly associated with
proportion of mPFC SWA 0.6–1Hz, with peak significance being detected
over mPFC (for mPFC P =0.020; for dlPFC P =0.034; and trends or non-significant associations
for Parietal P =0.072, Temporal P =0.162, and Occipital P =0.217). Finally, mPFC PIB was not associated with the
proportion of REM delta power 0.6–1Hz over prefrontal cortex
(r=−0.31, P =0.123; Kendall’s
τ=−0.16, P =0.269),
demonstrating that the association between mPFC PIB and SWA 0.6–1Hz was
specific to NREM sleep. Further, no significant association between mPFC PIB and
NREM spectral power was detected beyond the SWA range ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Together,
these data indicate that mPFC Aβ aggregation significantly predicts the
degree of impoverished NREM SWA expressed over mPFC in the memory-relevant
0.6–1Hz range.

To determine whether the association between β-amyloid pathology
and NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz was driven by a reduction in the number of slow
waves generated or a disruption in slow wave morphology, slow waves (SW) were
detected and examined using an established algorithm 25 . Similar to mPFC NREM SWA, a two-way,
repeated measures ANCOVA, with frequency
[0.6–1Hz/1–4Hz] as a within subjects factor and
mPFC PIB as a between subjects covariate, revealed a significant
frequency×mPFC PIB interaction predicting mPFC slow wave density
( P =0.020; Fig.
2c ) but not mean slow wave period ( P =0.257),
amplitude ( P =0.685) or slope
( P =0.535). Congruent with the measure of mPFC NREM SWA,
mPFC PIB was associated with lower mPFC SW density 0.6–1Hz (parameter
estimate t=−2.623, P =0.015) and higher
SW density at 1–4Hz (parameter estimate t=2.416, P =0.024). These data suggest that the association
between NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz and β-amyloid pathology is
statistically accounted for by the reduction in the incidence of 0.6–1Hz
slow waves, rather than morphological changes in SW slope, amplitude, or
period.

That mPFC PIB was associated with reduced SW generation within the mPFC
was explored by performing source analysis, using the validated sLORETA
method 26 , time-locking
to the negative slow wave peak. Source analysis revealed that the peak current
density associated with the negative peak of slow waves 0.6–1Hz detected
at CZ and FZ was localized within the mPFC ( Fig.
1b and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These data support the conclusion that mPFC
Aβ deposition is associated with fewer slow waves 0.6–1Hz
generated within the mPFC.

Next, we sought to determine whether reduced mPFC NREM SWA
0.6–1Hz, associated with higher mPFC β-amyloid burden, predicted
impaired long-term memory retention in cognitively healthy older adults. The
proportion of mPFC NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz (r=0.50, P =0.019; Fig. 2d )
positively predicted memory retention, and remained a significant predictor when
controlling for age and gender ( P =0.022 for mPFC NREM
SWA 0.6–1Hz, P =0.980 for age, P =0.494 for gender). Therefore, reductions in mPFC
NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz predicted worse overnight memory retention.

At the neural level, and consistent with a NREM sleep-dependent
hippocampal-neocortical model of memory consolidation 27 , 28 , the severity of impairment in NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz was
further associated with greater persistence (rather than progressive
independence 11 , 29 – 31 ) of post-sleep retrieval-related
hippocampal activation (r=−0.59, P =0.004; Fig. 3a ).
This association also remained significant when controlling for age and gender
( P =0.006 for mPFC NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz, P =0.897 for age, P =0.657
for gender). Though this association was maximal in the left hippocampus, it was
present bilaterally ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). No significant associations between
retrieval-related HC activation and NREM spectral power were detected beyond the
SWA range ( Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Implicating diminished memory consolidation in this association
between NREM SWA disruption and persistent hippocampal activity, post-sleep
retrieval-related activation within the hippocampus significantly predicted
worse overnight memory retention (r=−0.50, P =0.017) ( Fig.
3b ). Taken together, these data are consistent with the prediction that
the severity of impairment in NREM SWA 0.6–1Hz detected over mPFC, in
older adults, is significantly associated with worse overnight memory retention
and persistent reliance on the hippocampus during next day retrieval.

Having characterized the separate associations between mPFC Aβ
pathology, NREM SWA deficits, and hippocampus-dependent memory impairment, we
finally sought to determine the interactions between factors using path
analysis 32 .
Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that mPFC Aβ pathology exerted an
influence on memory not directly, but instead, indirectly, through its
association with impaired NREM SWA, thus compromising sleep-dependent
consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. Three models were constructed
( Fig. 4a–c ) and compared to
each other and standard saturation and independence control models to determine
the nature of these interactions. The standardized metrics used to determine
these interactions were: (1) root mean square residual (RMR), (2) goodness of
fit index (GFI), and (3) Bayesian information criterion (BIC; see Methods ) 33 – 35 . In
short, RMR values near 0 and GFI values above 0.9 are considered evidence for
sufficient model fit 34 . Lower
BIC values suggest better model fits, with a difference in BIC of over 10
suggesting marked differences between the models, a difference of 6–10
suggesting a strong difference, and a difference of 2–6 suggesting
marginal difference is present 35 . In the first model ( Fig.
4a ), mPFC Aβ pathology was allowed to directly predict
deficits in memory retention independent of NREM SWA (proportion of mPFC NREM
SWA 0.6–1Hz) and retrieval-related hippocampal activation. In the second
model ( Fig. 4b ), mPFC Aβ pathology
was associated with diminished memory retention independent of NREM SWA,
instead, being directly associated through its impact on retrieval-related
hippocampal activation. In the third, sleep-dependent, model ( Fig. 4c ), the associated influence of mPFC Aβ
pathology on impaired memory retention was not direct. Instead, the influence of
mPFC Aβ pathology was indirect, through its effects on diminished NREM
SWA, which consequentially predicted deficits in overnight memory retention and
hippocampus-dependent memory transformation. Of the three, the third,
sleep-dependent, model provided the superior statistical fit ( Fig. 4c ). Specifically, this sleep-dependent model
provided (i) the lowest RMR (RMR=0.006, compared to 0.021 for Model 1
and 0.021 for Model 2), (ii) the only GFI above 0.9 (GFI=0.931, compared
to 0.858 for Model 1 and 0.873 for Model 2), and (iii) the lowest BIC value
(BIC=24.676, compared to 29.640 for Model 1 and 29.131 for Model 2).
Moreover, only the sleep-dependent model outperformed both the saturation
(RMR=0.000, GFI=1.000, BIC: 30.910) and independence control
models (RMR=0.046, GFI=0.617, BIC: 30.747). Critically, however,
while all three models demonstrated significant associations between (i) NREM
SWA 0.6–1Hz and post-sleep retrieval-related hippocampal activation (all P <0.005; Fig.
4a–c ), and (ii) post-sleep retrieval-related hippocampal
activation and overnight memory retention (all P <0.010; Fig. 4a–c ), the only
significant path linking mPFC Aβ pathology to impaired memory retention
was the sleep-dependent model (Model 3), by way of the influence of mPFC
Aβ on NREM SWA ( P =0.017; Fig. 4c ). These results indicate that the association
between mPFC Aβ pathology and diminished memory consolidation is
significantly accounted for by the impairing influence of mPFC Aβ
pathology on NREM SWA, resulting in a profile of greater overnight forgetting
and persistent reliance on the hippocampus during next day retrieval.

## Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the current findings provide the first
evidence that cortical Aβ pathology is associated with impaired generation
of NREM slow wave oscillations that, in turn, predict the failure in long-term
hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation. While it is important to recognize that
the current findings are cross-sectional and correlational, limiting causal claims,
they nevertheless establish that the factors of Aβ and NREM sleep physiology
and hippocampus-dependent memory are significantly and directionally inter-related.
Thus, in addition to already established pathways associated with diminished
cognitive function 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , Aβ may additionally impair
hippocampus-dependent memory in older adults through its impact on NREM SWA.
Moreover, since sleep is a potentially modifiable factor, such findings raise the
possibility that therapeutic sleep intervention may aid in minimizing the degree of
cognitive decline associated with β-amyloid pathology in old age.

To date, age-related NREM sleep disruption has been described in older
adult, MCI, and AD cohorts 13 , 16 – 18 . Moreover, subjective reports of poor quality sleep are
associated with high Aβ burden in healthy older individuals 21 , with reductions in SWS and REM
sleep time associated with CSF Aβ and tau protein levels in AD
patients 18 . These findings
are supported by animal studies linking Aβ pathology to NREM sleep
fragmentation 20 . The
current study extends these reports by demonstrating that regionally specific
aggregation of Aβ within mPFC is associated with the selective
electrophysiological impairment of NREM slow wave activity, and that this sleep
disruption subsequently correlates with impaired hippocampal-neocortical memory
transformation and related overnight memory retention.

Our findings further highlight specificity within this pathological
interaction at two levels: anatomical and electrophysiological. Anatomically, the
selective association between mPFC Aβ pathology (and not other common
Aβ accumulating regions) and diminished slow waves suggests that this region
may be especially critical to the generation of such NREM sleep oscillations.
Indeed, source localization analyses in healthy young adults has revealed slow wave
generators within the same mPFC regions that commonly suffer early and extensive
Aβ burden 2 , 4 , 15 .
Electrophysiologically, the Aβ association with NREM SWA was additionally
specific to the low frequency range of SWA between 0.6–1Hz. This is of
particular relevance considering the recognition of the two mechanistically distinct
forms of NREM slow waves: the <1Hz slow oscillation and the delta wave
(1–4 Hz) 36 , 37 . While the mechanisms underlying the mPFC
Aβ frequency-specific association identified in the current study
(0.6–1Hz) remains unknown, it is plausible that β-amyloid pathology
impacts the generation/expression of slow oscillations through an impact on
coordinated cortico-thalamic hyperpolarized down states and depolarized up
states 36 , 37 . This may include the recognized reduction
in synaptic NMDAR functioning by Aβ 38 , 39 ; receptors that
are also necessary to generate NREM slow oscillations (and not delta
waves) 36 – 39 . In addition, or alternatively, Aβ
may exacerbate age-related prefrontal atrophy due to the neurotoxic effects of
Aβ 2 , 3 , 38 , 39 or Aβ-coordinated spread
of tau pathology through hippocampal-thalamic loops that interact with the reticular
nucleus of the thalamus and the cortico-thalamic loops that generate NREM slow
oscillations 3 , 5 , 40 .
Importantly, all these hypotheses offer clear, testable predictions for future
exploration within varied clinical and animal model systems.

In addition to Aβ being associated with diminished NREM sleep, a
growing body of evidence suggests that NREM sleep disruption reciprocally promotes
the build-up of Aβ. Interstitial Aβ levels in both humans and
rodents rise during periods of wakefulness and fall during sleep 19 . Moreover, sleep deprivation increases
Aβ plaque formation in rodent cortex 19 and alters CSF Aβ levels in humans 41 , yet the presence of NREM sleep
facilitates Aβ clearance 19 , 22 . These data, combined with
evidence linking Aβ pathology to NREM sleep disruption in rodents 20 and reduced NREM SWA between
0.6–1Hz in the current study, supports the interpretation of a bidirectional
relationship between sleep and Aβ pathology. While remaining speculative,
such an interpretation supports the proposal of a self-perpetuating cycle in which
the initial emergence of Aβ impairs the generation of NREM sleep
oscillations, which, in turn, consequently results in wake-dependent increases in
Aβ while diminishing the sleep-dependent clearance of Aβ 42 . As a result, Aβ buildup
would accelerate, exacerbating the pathological cascade leading to AD 3 .

Beyond the association between Aβ burden and impaired NREM SWA, the
current findings additionally characterize a functional consequence of this
association: impaired overnight consolidation of long-term memory. While prior
evidence suggests that the strength of association between Aβ burden and
memory retention in healthy older adults is only modest when memory is assessed
immediately after encoding 1 , 3 , 6 , the current findings indicate that this association becomes
significant when the retention interval is delayed, and thus involves
sleep-dependent memory processes. Consequentially, our data suggest that one
additional novel pathway linking cortical Aβ pathology to
hippocampus-dependent long-term memory functioning is through the association
between Aβ aggregation and disrupted NREM slow oscillations. Specifically,
the data support a model in which the severity of Aβ aggregation in mPFC
regions that generate NREM slow waves 15 predicts reductions in NREM slow waves 0.6–1Hz. This
reduction, in turn, is associated with diminished sleep-dependent memory
consolidation and the persistence (rather than the typical progressive
independence 27 , 28 , 11 , 30 ) of next day memory retrieval upon
hippocampal activity. Indeed, results from the path analyses support the hypothesis
that the influence of mPFC Aβ on hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation
was not direct, but through its impact on NREM slow waves 0.6–1Hz. These
associations remained robust when adjusting for age, gender, and atrophy.

Importantly, it should be noted that these data in no way preclude the
possibility that Aβ can influence memory independent of NREM slow waves, or
that other factors, such as atrophy or tau pathology may influence memory
independent of or dependent on associations with NREM slow waves. While the SEM
models did demonstrate significant inter-relatedness between Aβ pathology,
NREM sleep, and hippocampus-dependent memory, it does not explain the influence of
other, unmeasured factors, such as tau pathology, which may explain additional
variance in age-related, sleep-dependent memory impairment. It is therefore
necessary for future studies to employ models that examine multiple factors
associated with age-related cognitive decline, to develop a more comprehensive
account of how these factors interact with sleep and impact sleep-dependent memory.
However, these findings do establish that one influence of Aβ pathology on
hippocampus-dependent memory includes an impact on the cortical generation of NREM
slow waves and the associated consolidation of sleep-dependent memory.

Building on this model, and more generally, our findings offer several
clinical and public health considerations. First, should these associations prove to
be causal in cognitively normal older adults and AD cohorts, screening for and
treating NREM slow wave sleep abnormalities in older adult populations may aid in
reducing both the risk for developing AD and the rate at which AD progresses.
Indeed, disordered sleep is recognized to carry an increased risk for cognitive
decline and AD 43 , 44 , while superior sleep quality is associated
with resilience to cognitive decline and a reduced risk of developing AD 45 . Second, since associations
between Aβ pathology and NREM sleep physiology are observed in preclinical
older adults as well as in MCI and AD cohorts 13 , 18 , it is possible
that sleep disruption, specifically in the electrophysiological index of NREM slow
oscillatory activity (<1Hz), may represent an additional preclinical AD
biomarker. Finally, these data offer the empirical foundations on which future work
may determine whether Aβ-related sleep disruption plays a causal role in the
progression of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative dementias. They further
warrant the exploration of whether interventions that promote NREM SWA (in the
0.6–1Hz frequency range) minimize the progression of neurodegeneration and
the cognitive dysfunction associated with Aβ pathology.

## Methods
Thirty healthy older adult participants were recruited, with twenty-six
participants completing the study (18 females, mean±s.d., 75.1±3.5
years; Table 1 ). No statistical methods were
used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those
reported in previous publications 6 – 8 , 11 , 47 .
Data from ten of these participants were included in a previous
publication 11 . These ten
participants were selected for the present study, as they were the only participants
with concurrently acquired PIB-PET data. The study was approved by the local human
studies committee, with all participants providing written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria included presence of neurologic, psychiatric or sleep disorders,
current use of antidepressant or hypnotic medications, or being left handed.
Participants were free of depressive symptoms 48 , and all scored >25 on the mini mental state
exam 49 . Further, and in
addition to neuroradiological assessments and medical interviews (cf. 11 , 47 ; obtained within one year of study entry), participants
performed within 1.5 standard deviations of their age, gender, and education-matched
control group on tests of 1) episodic memory 50 , 51 and 2) frontal
function 52 , 53 ( Table
1 ). Episodic memory task data were specifically excluded when below two
standard deviations of the mean across participants, or when performing at chance
levels. PIB DVR does not follow a normal distribution, and, unlike behavioral
assessment, there are no numerical boundaries of the PIB DVR measure that render
this metric without scientific or clinical relevance. Consequently, there was no PIB
DVR exclusion threshold (within biological limits) employed in the current study.
Prior to study entry, participants underwent sleep disorders screening with a
polysomnography (PSG) recording night (described below) reviewed by a board
certified sleep medicine specialist (author B.L.). Participants were excluded if
they displayed evidence of a parasomnia or an Apnea/Hypopnea Index
≥15 54 , with four
participants being excluded due to evidence of sleep apnea). All participants
abstained from caffeine, alcohol, and daytime naps for the 48 hr before and during
the study. Participants kept normal, habitual sleep-wake rhythms and averaged
7–9 hr of reported time in bed per night prior to study participation,
verified by sleep logs ( Table 1 ). The
recording of sleep in the laboratory environment, as in the current study, is
advantageous for a number of data acquisition and quality control reasons. However,
it represents an important limitation considering that sleep amounts and efficiency
are often greater in the home setting. While total sleep time and NREM SWS time
often differ across these two contexts, it is of note that the measure of NREM sleep
spectral EEG power is highly consistent across nights within an individual in a
variety of contexts, such that within-subject night-to-night variability is much
smaller than between subjects variability in NREM SWA 55 , 56 .
This is of potential relevance to the current findings, since it was spectral NREM
SWA that demonstrated associations with PIB and memory measures rather than any
sleep stage metrics. Nevertheless, home PSG assessments will be necessary to provide
a more ecologically valid exploration of the interaction between β-amyloid
pathology, sleep and memory.

All participants underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
following [ 11 C]PIB injection. Within one year of
PIB-PET scanning, participants then entered the lab in the evening and trained
to criterion on a sleep-dependent episodic memory task (describe below),
followed by a short delay (10 min) recognition test. Participants were then
given an 8 hour sleep opportunity, measured with PSG, starting at their habitual
bed time ( Table 1 ). Approximately two
hours post-awakening, participants performed an event-related functional MRI
(fMRI) scanning session while performing a long delay (10 hr) recognition test.
PIB-PET data were acquired and analyzed separately (authors S.M. and J.V.) from
all other data analyzed (author B.M.), thus ensuring PSG, fMRI, and memory data
acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis were conducted blind to participant
Aβ status.

The word-pairs task 11 had an intentional encoding phase immediately followed by a training to
criterion phase, which was then followed by a short delay recognition test (10
min; 30 studied trials and 15 foil trials) and a long delay recognition test (10
hr, occurring 2 hours post-awakening within the MRI scanner; 90 studied trials
and 45 foil trials).

As described previously 11 , associative recognition memory was calculated by
subtracting both the ‘False alarm rate’ (FAR; proportion of foil
words endorsed as “previously studied”) and the ‘Lure
rate’ (LR; proportion of previously studied words erroneously paired
with the lure) from the ‘Hit rate’ (HR; proportion of previously
studied words paired with the correct nonsense word). 11 Episodic memory retention was
subsequently calculated as the difference in short and long delay recognition
memory performance [long delay – short delay] 11 , 57 . Two participants were excluded from analysis as
outliers (memory performance more than 2 standard deviations from the mean), and
two participants had memory and fMRI data lost due to computer theft.

PIB-PET scans were collected within one year of sleep and memory
assessment, as PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) values change minimally
within this duration 58 , 59 . Scanning was performed on 23
participants using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR PET scanner and on 3 participants
using a Siemens Biograph 6 PET/CT scanner in 3D acquisition mode post
[ 11 C]PIB injection (approximately 15 mCi) into
the antecubital vein. PIB DVR values have been shown to be highly comparable
across these two scanners, having no effect on the global PIB measure 60 . Dynamic acquisition frames
were obtained over 90 minutes, as reported 6 , 61 , following
transmission or CT scans for attenuation correction. PIB-PET data were
reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with
weighted attenuation, and images were smoothed using a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with
scatter correction. Each image is evaluated for excessive motion and adequacy of
statistical counts. PET image processing and analysis were performed using SPM8
to realign frames. Realigned PIB frames from the first 20 minutes of acquisition
were averaged and used to guide coregistration of each individual’s
PIB-PET scan to their structural MRI scan. Logan graphical analysis was used to
calculate voxel-wise distribution volume ratios (DVRs) with a cerebellar grey
matter region of interest (ROI) used as a reference region, as described
previously 6 , 61 . This analysis yielded a voxelwise DVR
image for each participant. Targeting our mPFC hypothesis, the following
Desikan-Killiany Atlas-derived 62 regions were used to construct our mPFC ROI: left and right
hemisphere superior frontal, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, and medial
orbitofrontal regions ( Fig. 1a ). In
addition, occipital cortex (right and left hemisphere cuneus, lingual,
pericalcarine, and lateral occipital regions), temporal cortex (right and left
hemisphere middle and superior temporal regions), parietal cortex (right and
left hemisphere inferior and superior parietal, supramarginal gyrus, and
precuneus regions), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right and left
hemisphere rostral and caudal middle frontal, pars opercularis, and pars
triangularis regions; DLPFC) ROIs were used as control measures to determine
specificity of mPFC Aβ effects. ROI DVR values were derived by
calculating the mean of all voxelwise DVR values within each ROI. To account for
the non-normal distribution of Aβ in the population, DVR measures were
normalized using the natural logarithm, as described previously 63 – 65 .

Scanning was performed on a Siemens Trio 3 Tesla scanner equipped with a
32-channel head coil. Functional scans were acquired using a
susceptibility-weighted, single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) method to image
the regional distribution of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal
[time repetition (TR)/time echo (TE) 2000/23 ms; flip angle 90°;
FatSat, FOV 224 mm; matrix 64×64; 37 3mm slices with 0.3mm slice gap,
descending sequential acquisition], and using parallel imaging
reconstruction (GRAPPA) with acceleration factor 2. Three functional runs were
acquired (159 volumes, 5.3 minutes). Following functional scanning, two
high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE
protocol with the following parameters: repetition time (TR), 1900 ms; echo time
(TE), 2.52 ms; flip angle, 9°; field of view (FOV), 256 mm; matrix, 256
× 256; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; and 176 slices. Optimized voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) was performed on coregistered mean MPRAGE images to examine
grey matter volume within the same mPFC ROI used to extract mPFC PIB DVR values;
VBM methods described in detail in 11 .

Functional MRI data were analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of
Imaging Neuroscience; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/ ) beginning with
standardized preprocessing (realignment, slice timing correction, and
coregistration), and with normalization accomplished using a template containing
elderly brains, as described previously 11 , 47 .

Following preprocessing, retrieval trials were sorted into
“Hits” (correct word-nonsense word recognition),
“Lures” (selection of the incorrect, previously studied,
nonsense word), “Misses” (incorrect selection of never studied
nonsense word or endorsement of word as “new”), “Correct
Rejections” (novel words correctly endorsed as “new”),
“False Alarms” (novel words incorrectly endorsed as
“studied”), and “Omissions” (trials with no
subject response) 11 , with each
trial modeled using a canonical hemodynamic response function. To generate a
validated contrast for retrieval-related activity, Hit events were contrasted
with Correct Rejection events [Hits – Correct
Rejections] 11 .
Individual activation maps were then taken to a second-level random effects
analysis to examine retrieval-related activation negatively associated with NREM
SWA and overnight memory retention measures. Activations were assessed at the
voxel level of p<0.05 family wise error (FWE) 66 corrected for multiple comparisons
within an a priori hippocampal region of interest (ROI; 8 mm
sphere [x=−22, y=−14,
z=−12] 24 in Talairach space and [x=−23,
y=−15, z=−16] after MNI
conversion 67 ), further
inclusively masked using an anatomical hippocampus ROI. To determine
associations between hippocampus activation and other variables of interest, the
cluster average of significant voxels was extracted using Marsbar 46 .

PSG on the experimental night was recorded using a Grass Technologies
Comet XL system (Astro-Med, inc., West Warwick, RI), including 19-channel
electroencephalography (EEG) placed using the 10–20 system,
electrooculography (EOG) recorded at the right and left outer canthi (right
superior; left inferior), and electromyography (EMG). Reference electrodes were
recorded at both the left and right mastoid (A1, A2). Data were digitized at
400Hz, and stored unfiltered (recovered frequency range of 0.1–100 Hz),
except for a 60-Hz notch filter. Sleep was scored using standard
criteria 68 . Sleep
monitoring on the screening night was recorded using a Grass Technologies AURA
PSG Ambulatory system (Astro-Med, inc., West Warwick, RI), and additionally
included nasal/oral airflow, abdominal and chest belts, and pulse oximetry.

EEG data from the experimental night were imported into EEGLAB
( http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/ ) and epoched into 5 s bins. Epochs
containing artifacts were manually rejected by a trained scorer (author B.A.M.),
and the remaining epochs were filtered between 0.4–50Hz (645±80
epochs per participant with 4.6%±2.1% of epochs
rejected). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) was then applied to the filtered EEG
signal at 5-second intervals with 50% overlap and employing hanning
windowing. Analyses in the current report focused, a priori , on
slow wave activity (SWA), defined as relative spectral power between
0.6–4.6Hz during slow wave sleep (NREM stages 3&4) 10 , 11 . Spectral power was subdivided into two bins for
analysis (0.6–1Hz/1–4Hz), to examine the impact of
β-amyloid on SWA frequencies particularly relevant to memory
functions 14 , 23 . A single summary proportional measure
was also derived by dividing the spectral power between 0.6–1Hz by the
sum of spectral power between 0.6–4Hz, to determine the relative
dominance of memory-relevant slow waves. Furthermore, due to our a
priori focus on mPFC, SWA measures at FZ and CZ derivations were
averaged and used as a measure of mPFC SWA ( Fig.
1b ). To ascertain topographic specificity of effects, SWA measures at
F3, F4, F7, and F8 derivations were averaged and used as a measure of dlPFC SWA,
SWA measures at P3, P4, and PZ derivations were averaged and used as a measure
of Parietal SWA, SWA measures at T3, T4, T5, and T6 derivations were averaged
and used as a measure of Temporal SWA, and SWA measures at O1 and O2 derivations
were averaged and used as a measure of Occipital SWA.

Slow wave detection and source analysis were performed to (1) calculate
the impact of mPFC Aβ on slow wave density, and (2) determine whether
memory-relevant FZ and CZ measured slow waves (0.6–1Hz) have an mPFC
source ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). EEG data
were filtered between 0.5–4Hz, and individual slow waves were detected
using a validated algorithm 25 .
Standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was
employed 26 as
previously described 69 , 70 . In short, this method
calculates current density sources using a discrete, three-dimensionally
distributed, linear minimum norm solution to the forward problem. Computations
are made using a head model based on the MNI152 template 71 . Prior to sLORETA analysis, EEG
preprocessing was conducted in MATLAB using the EEGLAB toolbox. For each
participant, filtered (0.5Hz–4Hz), artifact-rejected EEG was
event-marked separately for detected slow wave (0.6–1Hz) midpoints in
the FZ and CZ derivations. EEG was then epoched around each detected slow wave
midpoint (±100 ms). Slow wave epochs were then averaged and exported
separately for CZ and FZ detected slow waves. sLORETA analyses of slow wave
epochs were carried out using the freeware sLORETA utilities ( http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm ), consistent with previous
source analysis examinations 69 , 70 . Prior to current
density source calculation, all electrode derivations were registered and
transformed into 3D MNI space, yielding a spatial transformation matrix. Current
density source maps were then derived for each participant separately for CZ and
FZ time-locked EEG averages. CZ and FZ source maps were then averaged within
each participant, with CZ-FZ averaged source maps then averaged across
participants to generate a grand mean average source image for memory-relevant
CZ and FZ slow waves ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).

Two-way repeated measures ANCOVA models were used to determine the
influence of PIB-PET measures on NREM slow wave measures, with PIB-PET DVR
measures as a between subjects covariate and frequency
(0.6–1Hz/1–4hz) as a within-subjects factor. Associations
between PIB DVR measures, sleep measures, hippocampal activation, and episodic
memory retention were assessed using regression models. Normality was formally
tested, and all variables exhibited the skewness and kurtosis of a normal
distribution except PIB-PET DVR measures, which exhibited a normal kurtosis but
a right skewed distribution. Since PIB-PET DVR measures followed a right skewed
non-normal distribution, PIB DVR values were natural logarithm transformed
before analysis and regressions were further affirmed with follow-up
nonparametric Kendall’s Tau correlations. Analyses were completed using
SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

To determine whether mPFC Aβ statistically influenced
hippocampal-dependent episodic memory retention through mPFC NREM SWA, path
analyses were performed using a structural equation modeling framework 32 , 34 in Amos version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). This
multivariate modeling technique calculates the path coefficients, i.e. coupling
between model variables, given a specified model. Path coefficients reflect the
direct and proportional influence of one variable on another while controlling
for other variables in the model. Three hypothesized models were specified with
an equal number of paths. These models were then compared to each other and
saturation and independence models. The first model allowed Aβ to
directly impact memory retention independently of NREM SWA. The second model
allowed Aβ to impact memory retention independently of NREM SWA, but
this time indirectly through its effects on hippocampal activation. Finally,
model three instead required Aβ to impact memory retention solely
through its influence on NREM SWA. Three validated metrics were used to compare
model fits: BIC (Bayesian information criterion), RMR (root mean square
residual), and GFI (goodness of fit index) 33 – 35 . In
short, models with RMR near 0 and GFI above 0.9 were considered sufficient model
fits 34 . The model with
the lowest BIC value was considered the superior model, with a difference of
10+ suggesting large model differences, a difference of 6–10
suggesting medium model differences, and a difference of 2–6 suggesting
small model differences are present 35 . Within the superior model, individual path
coefficients were then examined for significance.
