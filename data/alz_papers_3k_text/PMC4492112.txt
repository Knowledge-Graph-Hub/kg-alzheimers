# Title
In vivointerrogation of gene function in the mammalian brain using CRISPR-Cas9

# Abstract
Probing gene function in the mammalian brain can be greatly assisted with methods to manipulate the genome of neurons in vivo . The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease (Cas)9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) 1 can be used to edit single or multiple genes in replicating eukaryotic cells, resulting in frame-shifting insertion/deletion (indel) mutations and subsequent protein depletion. Here, we delivered SpCas9 and guide RNAs using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to target single ( Mecp2 ) as well as multiple genes ( Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b ) in the adult mouse brain in vivo . We characterized the effects of genome modifications in postmitotic neurons using biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological and behavioral readouts. Our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated SpCas9 genome editing can enable reverse genetic studies of gene function in the brain.

## ONLINE METHODS
The MIT Committee on Animal Care (CAC) approved all animal procedures described here. Adult (12-26 weeks old) male C57BL/6N mice were used in the study.

For SpCas9 targets selection and generation of single guide RNA (sgRNA), the 20-nt target sequences were selected to precede a 5′-NGG protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. To minimize off-targeting effects, the CRISPR design tool was used ( http://crispr.mit.edu/ ). sgRNA was PCR amplified using U6 promoter as a template with forward primer: 5′-CGCACGCGTAATTCGAACGCTGACGTCATC-3′ and reverse primer containing the sgRNA with 20-nt DNA target site ( bold ): 5′-CACACGCGTAAAAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNC GGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCAC-3′. Control sgRNA sequence was designed to target lacZ gene from Escherichia coli (target sequence: TGCGAATACGCCCACGCGATGGG). EGFP-KASH 7 construct was a generous gift from Prof. Worman (Columbia University, NYC) and was used as PCR template for cloning the coding cassette into AAV backbone under the human Synapsin promoter ( hSyn ). U6- Mecp2 sgRNA coding sequence was introduced using Mlu I site. For the multiplex gene targeting strategy, individual sgRNAs were PCR amplified as described above. All three sgRNAs were ligated with PCR amplified hSyn -GFP-KASH-bGHpA cassette ( Fig. 4a ) by using the Golden Gate cloning strategy. After PCR amplification, the ligation product containing three sgRNAs and hSyn -GFP-KASH-bGH pA was cloned into AAV backbone. All obtained constructs were sequenced verified. In order to find the optimal promoter sequence to drive SpCas9 expression in neurons we tested: h Syn1 , mouse truncated Mecp2 (pMecp2 ) , and truncated rat Map1b (pMap1b) promoter sequences 6 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The following primers were used to amplify promoter regions: hSyn_F: 5′-GTGTCTAGACTGCAGAGGGCCCTG-3′; hSyn_R: 5′-GTGTCGTGCCTGAGAGCGCAGTCGAGAA-3′; Mecp2_F 5′-GAGAAGCTTAGCTGAATGGGGTCCGCCTC-3′; Mecp2_R 5′-CTCACCGGTGCGCGCAACCGATGCCGGGACC-3′; Map1b-283/-58_F 5′-GAGAAGCTTGGCGAAATGATTTGCTGCAGATG-3′; Map1b-283/-58_R 5′-CTCACCGGTGCGCGCGTCGCCTCCCCCTCCGC-3′.

Another truncation of rat map1b promoter was assembled with the following oligos: 5′-AGCTTCGCGCCGGGAGGAGGGGGGACGCAGTGGGCGGAGCGGAGACAGCACCTT CGGAGATAATCCTTTCTCCTGCCGCAGAGCAGAGGAGCGGCGGGAGAGGAACACTT CTCCCAGGCTTTAGC AGAGCCGGA-3′ and 5′-CCGGTCCGGCTCTGCTAAAGCCTGGGAGAAGTGTTCCTCTCCCGCCGCTCCTCTGCTCTGCGGCAGGAGAAAGGATTATCTCCGAAGGTGCTGTCTCCGCTCCGCCCACTGCGTCCCCCCTCCTCCCGGCGCGA-3′. Short synthetic polyadenylation signal (spA) 31 was assembled using the following DNA oligonucleotides: 5′-AATTCAATAAAAGATCTTTATTTTCATTAGATCTGTGTGTTGGTTTTTTGTGTGC-3′ and 5′- GGCCGCACACAAAAAACCAACACACAGATCTAATGAAAATAAAGATCTTTTATTG-3′. SpCas9 and its D10A/H840A mutant version (dSpCas9) were described previously 27 , 32 , 33 . Plasmid encoding red fluorescent protein (mCherry) under control of EF1α promoter was used for neuron transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies).

Neuro-2a (N2a) cells were grown in DMEM containing 5% FBS (BSA). For HEK293FT cells DMEM containing 10% FBS (FBS) was used. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or Polyethylenimine (PEI) “MAX” reagent (Polysciences), according to manufacturer’s protocols.

High titer AAV1/2 particles were produced using AAV1 and AAV2 serotype plasmids at equal ratios and pDF6 helper plasmid in HEK293FT and purified on heparin affinity column 34 . Titering of viral particles was done with qPCR. High titer AAV1 particles were produced by the UNC Vector Core Services (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). Low titer AAV1 particles in DMEM were produced as described previously 35 . Briefly, HEK293FT cells were transfected with transgene plasmid, pAAV1 serotype plasmid and pDF6 helper plasmid using PEI “MAX”. Culture medium was collected after 48 h and filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter (Millipore).

Primary cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 mouse brains 36 . Embryos of either sex were used. Cells were plated on poly- d -lysine (PDL)-coated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) or laminin/PDL-coated coverslips (VWR). Cultures were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in Neurobasal medium, supplemented with B27, Glutamax (Life Technologies) and penicillin/streptomycin mix.

For AAV transduction, cortical neurons in 500 μl Neurobasal culture medium were incubated at 7 DIV with up to 300 μl (double infection at 1:1 ratio) AAV1-containing conditioned medium from HEK293FT cells 35 . One week after transduction neurons have been harvested for downstream processing or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescent stainings or morphology analysis.

For visualization of neuronal morphology, cells at DIV7 were transfected with EF1α-mCherry expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) for 1 week as previously described 37 . For measurement of total dendrite length, all dendrites of individual neurons were traced using ImageJ software. Quantification of the number of primary dendrites, dendritic tips and the Sholl analysis 38 were performed on images acquired with fluorescent microscope at a 40× objective (Zeiss AxioCam A×10 microscope, Axiocam MRm camera). For dendrites number, ends of all non-axonal protrusions longer than 10 μm were counted. For Sholl analysis, concentric circles with 5 μm step in diameter were automatically drawn around the cell body, and the number of dendrites crossing each circle was counted using ImageJ software with a Sholl plug-in.

7 days after viral delivery, cells were harvested in 200 μl ice-cold PBS and cell pellets were spun down at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were swelled on ice for 5 min in 1 ml lysis buffer (10 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Tween-20). 1 ml ddH 2 O was added and lysate was kept on ice for 5 min before cell lysates were homogenized with Dounce homogenizer (Sigma); 20 times with pestle A, followed by 10 times with pestle B. 2 ml equilibration buffer (120 mM β-glycerophosphate pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol) was added and nuclei were centrifuged (1,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C) using a sucrose gradient (lower: 500 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KCl, 65 mM β-glycerophosphate pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol; upper: 340 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KCl, 65 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Number and quality of purified nuclei was controlled using bright-field microscopy.

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Preemptive analgesia was given (Buprenex, 1 mg/kg, i.p.). Craniotomy was performed according to approved procedures, and 1 μl of 1:1 AAV mixture (1 × 10 13 vector genomes (Vg)/ml) of sMecp2 -SpCas9; 6 × 10 12 Vg/ml of DNMT 3×sgRNA; 3–5 × 10 12 Vg/ml of h Syn -GFP-KASH) was injected into: dorsal dentate gyrus (anterior/posterior: −1.7; mediolateral: 0.6; dorsal/ventral: −2.15) and/or ventral dentate gyrus (anterior/posterior: −3.52; mediolateral: 2.65; dorsal/ventral: −3). For in vivo electrophysiology recording experiments ( Fig. 4 ), virus injection coordinates were 3 mm lateral (from Bregma) and 1 mm anterior from the posterior suture. The skull was thinned using a dremel drill with occasional cooling with saline, and the remaining dura was punctured using a glass micropipette filled with the virus suspended in mineral oil. Several injections (3–4) were made at neighboring sites, at a depth of 200–250 μm. A volume of 150–200 nl of virus mixture was injected at 75 nl/min rate at each site. After each injection, the pipette was held in place for 3-5 min before retraction to prevent leakage. The incision was sutured and proper post-operative analgesics (Meloxicam, 1–2 mg/kg) were administered for 3 d following surgery.

Two weeks after virus injection, mice were used for electrophysiology experiments. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and maintained using 0.8% isoflurane. The skin was excised, cleaned with sugi and a metal head plate was attached to the skull using glue and dental acrylic, and a 2 × 2 mm craniotomy was performed over the primary visual cortex (V1). The exposed area was then covered with a thin layer of 1.5% agarose in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose; pH 7.4). Animal body temperature was maintained during experiment 37.5 °C with a heating blanket.

Borosilicate pipettes (WPI) were pulled using a Sutter P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments). Tip diameter was around 1 μm while the resistance was between 3–5 MΩ. Recordings were made using custom software (Network Prism, Sur lab), written in Matlab (MathWorks), controlling a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon). A glass pipette electrode was inserted into the brain at an angle of 20–35 degrees and an Ag/AgCl ground electrode pellet (Warner Instruments) was positioned in the same solution as the brain and the objective. For fluorescent visualization, pipettes were filled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). The pipette was first targeted to the injection site using a 10× lens, and then targeted to individual GFP + cells using a 25× lens via simultaneous two-photon imaging at 770 nm. Cell proximity was detected through deflections in resistance observed in voltage clamp during a rapidly time-varying 5 mV command voltage pulse. Once resistance had increased by 5–10 MΩ, the amplifier was switched to current clamp, and spikes were recorded with zero injected current, under a Bessel filter of 4 KHz and an AC filter of 300 Hz. Virus-injected brains were perfused post hoc and immunohistochemistry was performed.

Oriented gratings using custom software written in Matlab PsychToolbox-3 were presented to assess the orientation selectivity and tuning of genome-edited neurons. Gratings were optimized for cellular responsiveness and were presented by stepping the orientation from 0–360 degrees in steps of 20 degrees, with each grating presentation being preceded for 4 s “off ” followed by 4 s “on,” for a total presentation duration of 144 s. Data were acquired directly into Matlab. Spike detection was performed via analysis routines that used manually defined thresholds followed by spike shape template matching for further verification. Every spike was tagged and displayed on screen in a graphical user interface whereupon it was manually reviewed for false positives and negatives by the experimenter. Spike times in response to every stimulus were then grouped into “on” or “off ” periods based on their timing relative to visual stimulation, and “on” spikes for each stimulus were decremented by the number of “off” spikes observed during an equal time period. For orientation experiments, # spikes per stimulus = (# spikes “on”) − (# spikes “off ”) because “on” and “off ” periods were the same duration.

For every cell of interest, the methods were used to collect responses for each oriented stimulus (0 to 360 degrees, in steps of 20 degrees). These responses were then turned into a “tuning curve” of orientation versus response for each trial. Orientation Selectivity Index (OSI) was computed by taking the vector average for the preferred orientation: OSI = ( ∑ i R ( θ i ) sin ( 2 θ i ) ) 2 + ( ∑ i R ( θ i ) cos ( 2 θ i ) ) 2 ∑ i R ( θ i )

Total hippocampus of adult male mice was quickly dissected in ice cold DPBS (Life Sciences). Dentate gyrus (DG) samples were prepared and separated from Ammon’s horn (CA) as described elsewhere 39 . Samples were directly used for downstream analysis or shock frozen on dry ice. For cell nuclei purification, dissected tissue was gently homogenized in 2 ml ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB) (320 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl, 3 mM Mg(Ac) 2 , 10 mM Tris pH7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) using 2 ml Dounce homogenizer (Sigma); 25 times with pestle A, followed by 25 times with pestle B. Next, 3 ml of HB was added up to 5 ml total and kept on ice for 5 min. For gradient centrifugation, 5 ml of 50% OptiPrep density gradient medium (Sigma) containing 5 mM CaCl, 3 mM Mg(Ac) 2 , 10 mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol was added and mixed. The lysate was gently loaded on the top of 10 ml 29% iso-osmolar OptiPrep solution in a conical 30 ml centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter, SW28 rotor). Samples were centrifuged at 10,100 × g (7,500 r.p.m.) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the nuclei pellet was gently resuspended in 65 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KCl, 340 mM sucrose and 5% glycerol. Number and quality of purified nuclei was controlled using bright-field microscopy.

Purified KASH-GFP-positive (GFP + ) and negative (GFP − ) intact nuclei were co-labeled with Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby Stain (1:500, Life Technologies) and sorted using BD FACSAria III (Koch Institute Flow Cytometry Core, MIT). After sorting, all samples were kept on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei pellets were stored at −80 °C or were directly used for downstream processing. Single-cell nuclei were sorted using Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter (FACS Center for Systems Biology, Harvard University) in 5 μl of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Kit (Epicentre) in 96-well format.

For functional testing of sgRNA, 50–70% confluent N2a cells were co-transfected with a single PCR amplified sgRNA and SpCas9 vector. Cells transfected with SpCas9 only served as negative control. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To isolate genomic DNA from AAV1 transduced primary neurons, DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit was used 7 d after AAV transduction, according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Sorted nuclei of dissected tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM SDS, 1 μg/μl of proteinase K and 50 ng/μl RNase A) at 55 °C for 30 min. Next, chloroform-phenol extraction was performed followed by DNA precipitation with ethanol, according to standard procedures. DNA was finally resuspended in TE Buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and used for downstream analysis. Functional testing of individual sgRNAs was performed with SURVEYOR nuclease assay (Transgenomics) using PCR primers listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Band intensity quantification was performed as described before 40 . For next-generation sequencing, DNA of single-cell nuclei was extracted in QuickExtract DNA Extraction Kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Two weeks after bilateral viral delivery of SpCas9 with guide targeting Mecp2 (four animals) or SpCas9 with gRNA targeting lacZ (four animals), DG and CA1 regions of hippocampus were quickly dissected in ice cold DPBS (Life Sciences) as previously described 39 and transferred immediately to RNA-later solution (Ambion). After 24 h in 4 °C the tissue was moved to −80 °C. Populations of 100 targeted neuronal nuclei were FACS sorted into 10 μl of TCL buffer supplemented with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Qiagen), centrifuged for 1 min and then frozen immediately on dry ice. RNA was purified by AMPure RNAcleanXP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and washed three times with 80% ethanol, omitting the final elution. The beads with captured RNA were air-dried and processed immediately for cDNA synthesis. Samples with no nuclei were used as negative controls. Three DG population samples were used from each animal, to a total of 24 population samples, and an additional 6 population samples taken from the CA1 region of control animals. From each sample a cDNA library was prepared following the SMART-seq2 protocol as previously done 41 , only replacing the reverse transcriptase enzyme with 0.1 μl of Maxima H Minus enzyme (200 U/μl, Thermo Scientific), and scaling down the PCR reaction to a volume of 25 μl. The tagmentation reaction and final PCR amplification were done using the Nextera XT DNA Sample preparation kit (Illumina), with the following modifications: all reaction volumes were scaled down by a factor of 4, and the libraries were pooled after the PCR amplification step by taking 2.5 μl of each sample. The pooled libraries were cleaned and size-selected using two rounds of 0.7 volume of AMPure XP SPRI bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Samples were loaded on a High-Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent) to check the quality of the library, whereas quantification was done with Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Invitrogen). The pooled libraries were diluted to a final concentration of 4 nM and 12 pmol and were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (Life Technologies) with 75 bp paired end reads.

Bowtie2 index was created based on the mouse mm9 UCSC genome and known Gene transcriptome 42 , and paired-end reads were aligned directly to this index using Bowtie2 with command line options -q–phred33-quals -n 2 -e 99999999 -l 25 -I 1 -X 1000 -a -m 200 –p 4–chunkmbs 512. Next, RSEM v1.27 was run with default parameters on the alignments created by Bowtie2 to estimate expression levels. The gene level expression estimates (tau) calculated by the RSEm program, were multiplied by 1,000,000 to obtain transcript per million (TPM) estimates for each gene, and TPM estimates were transformed to log-space by taking log(TPM+1). Genes were considered detected if their transformed expression level was equal to or above 1 (in log(TPM+1) scale). A library was filtered out if it had less than 8,000 genes detected. Based on this criterion, four libraries were filtered out and excluded from the downstream analysis. To test the specificity of the dissected brain regions, we chose known marker genes in the dentate gyrus region ( Igfbp5, Tdo2 and Dsp ) and in the CA1 region ( Nov ) and additional shared neuronal markers ( Gria1 and Camk2a ), and tested their relative expression levels (in log(TPM+1) units) within the DG samples and the CA1 samples in control animals ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). To find differentially expressed genes between control animals and Mecp2 sgRNA expressing animals, Student’s t -test (Matlab V2013b) with correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure, q < 0.01) was performed. The t -test was run only on the highly expressed genes, which were defined to have mean expression level above 0.9 quantile (~6 log(TPM+1)) across all chosen samples. The expression levels (in log(TPM+1) units) of the differentially expressed genes across samples were clustered using hierarchical clustering (Matlab V2013b).

For immunofluorescent staining of primary neurons, cells were fixed 7 d after viral delivery with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature (RT). After washing three times with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) (Life Technologies), 5% donkey serum (DS) (Sigma) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at RT. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 2.5% NGS, 2.5% DS and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBST, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Finally, coverslips were mounted using VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and imaged using Zeiss AxioCam A×10 microscope and an Axiocam MRm camera. Images were processed using the Zen 2012 software (Zeiss). Quantifications were performed by using ImageJ software 1.48 h and Neuron detector plugin.

Mice were euthanized 4 weeks after viral delivery by a lethal dose of ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. Fixed tissue was sectioned using vibratome (Leica, VT1000S). Next, 30 μm sections were boiled for 2 min in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM tri-sodium citrate dehydrate, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6.0) and cooled down at RT for 20 min. Sections were blocked with 4% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST with 4% NGS overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in TBST, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies. After washing with TBST three times, sections were mounted using VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI and visualized with confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710, Zen 2012 Software).

Following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-MeCP2 (07-013, Millipore, 1:200); mouse anti-NeuN (A60, Millipore, 1:50-1:400); chicken anti-GFAP (ab4674, Abcam, 1:400); mouse anti-Map2 (HM-2, Sigma, 1:500); chicken anti-GFP (1020, Aves labs, 1:200-1:400); rabbit anti-HA (C29F4, Cell Signaling, 1:100). Secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488, 568 or 633 (Life Technologies, 1:500-1:1,000).

Control and transduced primary neurons were stained using the LIVE/DEAD assay (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To avoid interference with the GFP signal from GFP-KASH expression, cells were stained for DEAD (ethidium homodimer) and DAPI (all cells) only. Stained cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and DEAD, GFP- and DAPI-positive cells were counted by using ImageJ 1.48h software and Neuron detector plug-in.

Transduced primary cortical neurons (24-well, 7 d after viral delivery) or transduced tissue samples (4 weeks after viral delivery) were lysed in 50 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 0.1% SDS and proteases inhibitors (Roche, Sigma). Cell lysates were sonicated for 5 min in a Bioruptor sonicater (Diagenode) and protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein lysates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated under reducing conditions on 4–15% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by western blotting using primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Dnmt3a (H-295, Santa Cruz, 1:500), mouse anti-Dnmt1 (60B1220.1, Novus Biologicals, 1:800), rabbit anti-MeCP2 (07-013, Millipore, 1:400), mouse anti-HA (6E2, Cell Signaling, 1:400) rabbit anti-Tubulin (AA2, Sigma, 1:10,000) followed by secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10,000). GAPDH was directly visualized with rabbit HRP coupled anti-GAPDH antibody (14C10, Cell Signaling, 1:10,000). Tubulin or GAPDH served as loading control. Blots were imaged with ChemiDoc MP system with ImageLab 4.1 software (Bio-Rad), and quantified using ImageJ software 1.48 h.

12-week-old C57BL/6N male mice were stereotactically injected with SpCas9 and Mecp2 or DNMT targeting sgRNA vectors into the dorsal or dorsal+ventral DG regions, respectively. Animals were habituated to the experimenter and the behavior room for 7 d. SpCas9/ lacZ gRNA-injected littermates served as controls. At day 1, mouse cages were placed into an isolated anteroom to prevent mice from hearing auditory cues before and after testing. Individual mice were placed into the fear conditioning chamber (Med Associates Inc.) and a 12 min habituation period was performed. After habituation the mice were placed back to their home cages. The next day (training day), individual mice were placed into the chamber and were allowed to habituate for 4 min. After another 20 s (pre-tone) interval, the tone (auditory cue) at a level of 85 dB, 2.8 kHz was presented for 20 s followed by 18 s delay interval before the foot-shock was presented (0.5 mA, 2 s). After the foot-shock, 40 s interval (post-tone/shock) preceded a next identical trial starting with the 20 s pretone period. The training trial was repeated six times before the mice were placed back to their home cages. At day 3 (testing day), mice were first placed in the conditioning (training) context chamber for 3 min. Next, mice were placed in an altered context-conditioning chamber (flat floor versus grid, tetrameric versus heptameric chamber, vanillin scent), and the testing trial was repeated. Freezing behavior was recorded and analysis was performed blind off-line manually and confirmed with Noldus EthoVision XT software (Noldus Information Technology).

During the open field test, animals were placed in the square arena with opaque walls (40 × 40 cm, Stoelting) for 10 min while their behavior was recorded. The total distance moved, velocity and time spent in the center of arena were scored.

For the novel object recognition test animals were familiarized with the arena (40 × 40cm, Stoelting) for 10 min, 24 h before the experiment. During training phase, 2 identical objects (black spheres) were placed in the corners of the arena. Animals were positioned in the arena facing opposite wall to the objects and left free to explore for 5 min while their behavior was scored and recorded. After the training phase animals were returned to home cages. After 2 h of delay phase, object recognition test was performed. Animals were placed in the arena where one of the familiar objects was swapped with a novel one (white cube). Location of the novel object was alternated between animals. Animals were scored and recorded for 3 min. Based on the interaction time with objects a discrimination ratio (preference for novel object) was calculated: total novel object interaction time/total interactions time with both objects.

For the elevated plus maze test mice were placed at the junction of the open and closed arms of the maze (Stoelting), facing the open arm opposite to the experimenter and left to explore the maze for 5 min. During that time animal was tracked and recorded. The total distance traveled in the open arms and time spent in open arms were measured automatically with Ethovision software (Noldus).

To find potential off-targets for the DNMT family genes, the “CRISPR Design Tool” ( http://crispr.mit.edu/ ) was used. Targeted cell nuclei from dentate gyrus were FACS sorted 10 weeks after viral delivery and genomic DNA was purified as described above. For each gene of interest, the genomic region flanking the CRISPR target site was amplified by a fusion PCR method to attach the Illumina P5 adaptors as well as unique sample-specific barcodes to the target amplicons (for on- and off-target primers see Supplementary Table 3 ) 26 . Barcoded and purified DNA samples were quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and pooled in an equimolar ratio. Sequencing libraries were then sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (Life Technologies), with 300 bp reads length.

The MiSeq reads for pooled nuclei were analyzed as described previously 26 . Briefly, reads were filtered by Phred quality (Q score) and aligned using a Smith-Waterman algorithm to the genomic region 50 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the target site. Indels were estimated in the aligned region from 5 nucleotides upstream to 5 nucleotides downstream of the target site (a total of 30 bp). Negative controls for each sample were used to estimate the inclusion or exclusion of indels as putative cutting events. We computed a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for the fraction of reads having target-regions with true-indels, using the per-target-region-per-read error rate from the data of the negative control sample. The MLE scores for each off-target are listed in Supplementary Table 1 .

The MiSeq reads for single nuclei was analyzed slightly differently. First, samples with count of reads less than 100 were removed from analysis. Sequencing reads were aligned separately to primer sequence and 10 bp genomic sequence taken from 3′ downstream of the primer sequence using a Smith-Waterman algorithm. Reads were filtered out if there was any indel found within the alignment. Next, reads were trimmed from the 10 bp genomic sequence and aligned to the 23 bp guide sequence (target sequence + PAM sequencing). An alignment is considered as having an indel if an indel is found within ±6 bp around the expected Cas9 cut site. Indel pattern distribution was obtained by counting alignments containing different indel sequences separately. In order to model sequencing error, reads were aligned to another 23 bp genomic sequencing on 3′ downstream of the 10 bp genomic sequencing used in previous alignment, and distribution of alignments containing indels, denoted as indel types, was quantified. Sequencing reads containing indel was modeled as Bernoulli random variable and the parameter was fitted with a gamma distribution. For the following analysis, we chose the threshold for sequencing error rate at the false discovery rate of 2%. Sequencing reads from each single nuclei were filtered in order to remove possible doublet contaminations, whose ratio of second dominant indel type to the first dominant indel type and ratio of the third dominant indel type to the second dominant indel type both were found higher than the threshold for sequencing error. Next each single nuclei was classified as (i) wild-type, if the fraction of reads containing indels was lower than the sequencing error threshold, (ii) double allelic modified, if the fraction of reads containing no indel was lower than the sequencing error threshold, (iii) single allelic modified, if it did not fit to the two scenarios.

If not stated otherwise data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (Graphpad Software). Groups were compared using an unpaired, two sided t -test. Normal distribution was assumed. Data are shown as mean with s.e.m.
