# Title
Quaternary structure defines a large class of amyloid-β
oligomers neutralized by sequestration

# Abstract
The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) as amyloid fibrils and
toxic oligomers is an important step in the development of Alzheimer's disease
(AD). However, there are numerous potentially toxic oligomers and little is
known about their neurological effects when generated in the living brain. Here,
we show that Aβ oligomers can be assigned to one of at least two classes
(Type 1 and Type 2) based on their temporal, spatial and structural
relationships to amyloid fibrils. The Type 2 oligomers are related to amyloid
fibrils and represent the majority of oligomers generated in
vivo, but remain confined to the vicinity of amyloid plaques and do
not impair cognition at levels relevant to AD. Type 1 oligomers are unrelated to
amyloid fibrils and may have greater potential to cause global neural
dysfunction in AD because they are dispersed. These results refine our
understanding of the pathogenicity of Aβ oligomers in
vivo .

## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be caused by neurotoxic assemblies of
the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Distinct assemblies of Aβ have been
found in the human brain, including amyloid fibrils and a few specific oligomers
( Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2011 ; Lesne et al., 2013 ; Lu et al., 2013 ; Noguchi et
al., 2009 ; Shankar et al., 2008 ).
It is widely accepted that Aβ oligomers (Aβo) are more potent
neurotoxins than amyloid fibrils, and several oligomers have been isolated and
studied in detail. These oligomers differ in size and, to varying degrees, in their
temporal and spatial patterns of expression, association with other brain proteins,
and effects on neuronal function and viability ( Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2011 ; Lesne et
al., 2006 ; Lesne et al., 2013 ; Noguchi et al., 2009 ; Shankar et al., 2008 ). However, there is no
general consensus as to which oligomers are the most significant in the
pathophysiology of AD nor, indeed, on the total number of types of Aβo
produced in the brain (reviewed in ( Benilova et al.,
2012 )). The diversity of form and function among the Aβo studied
thus far, and the likely existence of an indeterminate number of other Aβo,
make the isolation and functional characterization of all potential forms a
laborious, if not impossible, task. In an attempt to resolve this predicament, we
asked whether Aβo generated in vivo could be categorized
according to their spatiotemporal patterns of expression and structural features as
inferred from their reactivity with “conformation-selective”
antibodies, and, if so, whether the different classes of oligomers exert different
pathological effects on neural function.

Studies using conformation-selective antibodies have identified at least two
classes of oligomers that are generated in vitro and in the brains
of AD patients and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice ( Glabe, 2008 ). The OC and A11
conformation-selective antibodies detect mutually exclusive structural epitopes of
amyloid-forming proteins, independent of primary amino acid sequence ( Kayed et al., 2007 ; Wu et al., 2010 ). OC antibodies recognize Aβ amyloid
fibrils as well as Aβ oligomers ( Kayed et
al., 2007 ); it has been suggested, but never directly demonstrated, that
OC detects in-register parallel β-sheets ( Glabe, 2009 ; Wu et al., 2010 ).
Conversely, A11 antibodies have been shown to recognize out-of-register
anti-parallel β-sheet structures ( Laganowsky
et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2012 ).
Our objective in the current work is to address the following questions related to
Aβo generated in vivo : i ) are there
distinct subtypes of Aβo based on quaternary structural motifs, as defined by
their reactivity with OC and A11 antibodies; ii ) do OC- and
A11-reactive oligomers differ in their spatial and temporal patterns of appearance;
and iii ) what is the most abundant type of Aβo produced in
the brain and how does it affect neurological function?

To address these questions, we employed transgenic mice expressing APP
variants linked to AD. The types of Aβo (e.g., Aβ dimers and
Aβ*56, a putative dodecamer) and fibrils in mice vary dynamically, over a
time scale of weeks to months (for examples in Tg2576, Arc6 and hAPP-J20 mice, see
( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Lesne et al., 2006 ; Shankar et
al., 2009 )). In the lines that have been characterized, the sequence of
appearance of specific Aβ assemblies is consistent. Here, we studied four
lines of transgenic mice. In Tg2576 ( Hsiao et al.,
1996 ), hAPP-J20 ( Cheng et al.,
2007 ) and TetO-APP SweInd mice ( Jankowsky et al., 2005 ), the A11-reactive oligomer Aβ*56 appears
in young mice ~3-6 months prior to dense-core plaques and correlates with
spatial memory deficits ( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Fowler et al., 2014 ; Lesne et al., 2006 ). In rTg9191 mice ( Liu et al., in press ), we found dense-core plaques emerging at
~12 months but no Aβ*56 at any age ( Liu et al., in press ).

Here, we show that OC antibodies selectively recognized quaternary structural
motifs found in naturally occurring Aβ amyloid fibrils, namely in-register
parallel β-sheets (for review, see ( Glabe,
2009 ; Tycko, 2011 )). We also show
that OC-immunoreactive Aβo appeared only after plaque formation and that they
were highly concentrated around amyloid plaques in the brains of APP transgenic
mice. Conversely, A11-immunoreactive oligomers appeared prior to amyloid plaques in
multiple lines of APP transgenic mice (here, and see also ( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Fowler et
al., 2014 ; Lesne et al., 2006 ))
and were dispersed in the brain parenchyma without any relationship to amyloid
plaques. We classified the Aβo generated in the brains of these APP
transgenic mice into two categories: Type 1, which have no temporal, spatial or
structural relationship to amyloid fibrils, and Type 2, which are related to amyloid
fibrils temporally, spatially and structurally. We found that in brains bearing
dense-core plaques, Type 2 Aβo predominate, consistent with predictions from in vitro studies ( Cohen et al.,
2013 ). However, Type 2 Aβo appear to have limited potential to
diffuse away from dense-core plaques or to disrupt forebrain neural networks, as
assessed by tests of cognition.

## Results
We first sought to more precisely define the structures recognized by OC
and A11 antibodies. It was not possible to isolate from the brains of transgenic
mice Aβo of sufficient purity or quantity to perform biophysical
characterization of their structures, so we turned to synthetically prepared
Aβ fibrils with defined quaternary structures. It had been suggested that
OC detects in-register parallel β-sheets ( Glabe, 2009 ; Wu et al.,
2010 ), but this hypothesis had not been directly tested. Amyloid fibrils
containing in-register parallel β-sheets or anti-parallel β-sheets
were prepared from the 40-residue Aβ peptide with the AD-linked
“Iowa” mutation (D23N_Aβ40). Transmission electron
microscopy and solid state nuclear magnetic spectroscopy confirmed that these
fibrils had the morphological features of “parallel” and
“anti-parallel” fibrils whose backbone registries in the
hydrophobic core regions were defined ( Qiang et
al., 2012 ; Sgourakis et al.,
2015 ) ( Figures 1A-1C ). OC
antibodies preferentially recognized parallel, over anti-parallel, fibrils in
immunoblots ( Figure 1D ).

It has also been suggested that A11 antibodies recognize structures
containing anti-parallel β-sheets ( Glabe,
2009 ; Wu et al., 2010 ), and
A11 indeed reacts with synthetic oligomers composed of out-of-register
anti-parallel β-sheets ( Laganowsky et
al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2012 ).
We first tested whether A11 antibodies prefer anti-parallel over parallel
β-sheets, using synthetic Aβ fibrils. A11 antibodies also detected
these synthetic fibrils, although with less sensitivity than did OC ( Figure S1A ). Similarly to
OC, A11 preferred parallel fibrils to anti-parallel fibrils. While this result
might seem at odds with the notion of two structurally distinct classes of
oligomers, a potential resolution may be found in Figure S1B . We compared
the A11 signal generated by synthetic Aβ fibrils to the signal generated
by Aβo in the brains of 4-month-old hAPP-J20 mice, which lack OC-reactive
Aβ species (see below). A much stronger signal was observed from the
brain extracts, estimated to contain ~3 pg total Aβ, based on semi-quantitative analysis of Aβ in Western blots
(data not shown) and previously reported ELISA measurements of Aβ levels
in hAPP-J20 mice at this age ( Cheng et al.,
2007 ), than from ng quantities of the synthetic Aβ fibrils. We
concluded that while A11 can bind amyloid fibrils, it preferentially recognizes
some structural feature of the brain-derived Aβo that is not found in
fibrils containing in-register β-sheets.

Aqueous extracts were prepared from the brains of Tg2576, hAPP-J20, and
rTg9191 APP transgenic mice at ages prior to and following the appearance of
dense-core plaques ( Figures 2A-2J ), and
subjected to immunoblotting under non-denaturing conditions. OC immunoreactivity
was seen only in extracts from plaque-containing brains in all three lines
examined ( Figures 2K and 6A ; see also ( Liu et al., in press )). Conversely, A11 immunoreactivity appeared
prior to plaque deposition in Tg2576 and hAPP-J20 mice and remained present in
plaque-bearing brains ( Figure 2L ); no A11
immunoreactivity was observed in rTg9191 brain extracts from any age ( Figures 2L , S2A and S2B , and ( Liu et al., in press )). A11 and OC
immunoreactivity disappeared when extracts were immunodepleted of Aβ
using a mixture of Aβ antibodies prior to immunoblotting ( Figures S2C and S2D ),
demonstrating that the oligomers seen by A11 and OC in the brains of APP
transgenic mice were indeed composed of Aβ. These results show that A11
and OC antibodies recognize different structures generated in
vivo , as there exist brain-derived Aβ assemblies that are
A11-positive/OC-negative (in young Tg2576 and hAPP-J20 mice) or
OC-positive/A11-negative (in rTg9191 mice), extending the findings that OC and
A11 recognize mutually exclusive epitopes on synthetic Aβo generated in vitro ( Kayed et al.,
2007 ; Wu et al., 2010 ).

Tg2576, hAPP-J20, TetO-APP SweInd and rTg9191 mice express
human APP at levels that vary between lines and contain one or more variants
(Swedish in Tg2576; both Swedish and Indiana in hAPP-J20 and
TetO-APP SweInd , and both Swedish and London in rTg9191). These
alterations result in different levels and amino acid compositions of Aβ,
which we hypothesize contribute to the variability in the amount and types of
Aβo generated, by analogy with in vitro studies. To
determine whether the amount of Aβ expressed does indeed affect the
relative levels of A11- and OC-reactive Aβo, we turned to
TetO-APP SweInd mice. These mice carry a regulatable APP
transgene, allowing us to manipulate levels of APP expression, and, hence,
levels of Aβ. When APP expression was suppressed by 90% for five weeks in
plaque-bearing TetO-APP SweInd mice, TBS-soluble A11-reactive species
decreased 60%, but TBS-soluble OC-reactive species remained stable ( Figure 3 ). These results support the
hypothesis that in the presence of amyloid fibrils, the reaction kinetics favor
the generation of OC-reactive over A11-reactive Aβo.

We went on to use OC antibodies to detect Aβo in the brains of
two mouse models: rTg9191 and Tg2576. We found that brains of both rTg9191 and
Tg2576 mice showed areas of intense OC-immunoreactivity encircling Congo
red-positive dense plaque cores ( Figure S3A ). In contrast to dense-core plaques, we found no
OC-reactivity in diffuse plaques lacking dense cores and plaque-associated
cytopathology ( Serrano-Pozo et al.,
2011 ).

Since immunohistological methods are not optimally suited to measure
finely dispersed molecules, it is possible that we did not detect low
concentrations of OC-immunoreactive Aβo located outside the immediate
vicinity of dense-core plaques. We therefore performed biochemical analyses on
microdissected brain tissue fractions to more accurately define the spatial
distribution of OC-immunoreactive Aβo and to discriminate between
insoluble and soluble OC-immunoreactive assemblies.

Using laser microdissection, we isolated three issue fractions in
rTg9191 mice: i ) dense plaque cores containing Aβ
fibrils; ii ) halos extending 50 μm from the edge of the
plaque cores; and iii ) plaque-free zones, annuli extending
80-100 μm from the outer edges of the halos ( Figure 4A ). We opted to use autofluorescence rather than
Thioflavin S to identify candidate dense-core plaques, because Thioflavin S
artificially generated SDS-stable oligomers ( Figure S3B ). We performed
control studies to verify the identity of autofluorescent structures by
Thioflavin S and Aβ immunohistochemistry using 4G8 ( Figure S3C ). We then
measured native Aβ assemblies in each tissue fraction in dot blots using
OC antibodies, and found >99.9% of immunoreactivity confined to the cores
and halos ( Figures 4B and 4C ).

OC-immunoreactive Aβo thus are spatially, as well as temporally,
associated with amyloid fibrils in the brains of APP transgenic mice. Further,
OC-immunoreactive Aβo very probably share the in-register parallel
β-sheet structure that is characteristic of brain-derived amyloid fibrils
( Lu et al., 2013 ). The spatial and
temporal patterns of appearance of OC-immunoreactive oligomers strongly support
the hypothesis that these oligomers form via a process of secondary
self-assembly dependent upon pre-existing amyloid fibrils (see Discussion and Figure
S7 ). We hereafter refer to OC-positive oligomers that exhibit spatial and
temporal relationships to amyloid fibrils as Type 2 Aβo. The laser
microdissection results indicate that ~all OC-immunoreactive Aβo
in the brains of rTg9191 mice meet the spatial criterion for Type 2
oligomers.

We next asked what fraction of the cortex is occupied by Type 2
oligomers. Based on stereological analyses of Thioflavin S-stained sections and
the geometry of dense-core plaques (see Note S1 ), we estimated the volume of the cortex occupied by
Type 2 Aβo in rTg9191 mice to be 11.4%; therefore, >99.9% of the
OC-immunoreactive Aβo in rTg9191 mice were confined to 11.4% of the
cortex.

To measure other potential soluble Aβ assemblies in rTg9191
brains, we solubilized the Aβ assemblies from each tissue fraction in
detergents, fractionated them by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
(which denatures the assemblies, as described below), and detected the denatured
Aβ assemblies by immunoblotting with two different anti-Aβ-specific
antibodies (6E10, Figure 4D ; 4G8, Figure S4A ). We found an
array of Aβ species in the cores and halos, but no Aβ assemblies
in the plaque-free fraction. In addition, we found a strong concordance between
measurements of the percentage of soluble Aβ assemblies located in the
cores and halos obtained from dot blots with OC antibodies (>99.9%, Figure 4C ) and measurements obtained from
Western blots with the two anti-Aβ antibodies (≥99.6%, Figures 4E and S4B ), suggesting that
all, or nearly all, of the soluble Aβ oligomers in rTg9191 mice are Type
2 Aβo.

In additional biochemical studies, we found that when extracts of
rTg9191 brains containing native Type 2 Aβo were fractionated by
size-exclusion chromatography and subsequently denatured by SDS-PAGE, Aβ
species appeared in immunoblots as monomers, dimers, and larger oligomers ( Figure S4C ). Dimers were
the most abundant Aβ oligomeric species in the immunoblots and eluted in
two distinct sets of fractions; one set of fractions corresponded to the
molecular masses of globular proteins ranging from ~500 kDa to
~2000 kDa while the other set of fractions corresponded to ~60 kDa
to ~200 kDa proteins. We inferred from these results that the dimers in
the immunoblots of denatured rTg9191 brain extracts represent disassembled
high-molecular-mass Type 2 Aβo, but we cannot exclude the existence of
free non-globular dimers with larger radii of hydration than would be expected
for a globular protein with a molecular mass of ~9 kDa, the theoretical
molecular mass of dimers.

The A11-immunoreactive oligomer Aβ*56 appears months before the
emergence of the first detectable dense-core plaques in Tg2576 mice ( Kawarabayashi et al., 2001 ; Lesne et al., 2006 ) and hAPP-J20 ( Cheng et al., 2007 ; Wright et al., 2013 ). We used Tg2576 mice, in which
Aβ*56 was originally described ( Lesne et
al., 2006 ), to compare the spatial distribution of Aβ*56 to
that of Type 2 Aβo. We analyzed microdissected tissue fractions by dot
blotting and Western blotting ( Figures 5A,
5C and S4D ).
In quantitative analyses, we found a striking divergence in the distribution of
OC-immunoreactive Aβo and Aβ*56: 99.5% of OC-immunoreactive
Aβo were concentrated within plaque cores and halos ( Figure 5B ), whereas most of the Aβ*56 (≥98.7%)
was distributed outside the core, in the halo and plaque-free zone ( Figures 5D and S4E ). We estimated that
Type 2 Aβo and Aβ*56 occupy 13.9% and 98.4%, respectively, of the
volume of the cortex we sampled in aged Tg2576 mice (see Note S1 ).

Thus, in contrast to Type 2 Aβo, Aβ*56 differs from
amyloid fibrils in its temporal expression; spatial distribution; and quaternary
structure, as inferred from its immunoreactivity with conformation-selective
antibodies. We hereafter refer to A11-positive oligomers that appear
independently of amyloid fibrils as Type 1 Aβo.

To determine the relative abundance of Type 2 Aβo and
Aβ*56, we estimated their masses in aqueous brain extracts from
21-month-old Tg2576 mice. To ascertain the Aβ content of Type 2
Aβo, we compared OC-immunoreactivity of extracts to that of
synthetically-produced in-register parallel β-sheet Aβ fibrils
containing known quantities of Aβ (measured by ELISA using 6E10
antibodies, following denaturation with hexa-fluoro-isopropanol (HFIP)). This
method assumes that the relationship between OC immunoreactivity and Aβ
content is the same for the synthetic fibrils and brain-derived Type 2
Aβo. Using this method, Type 2 oligomers were found to contain 14,500
± 1,500 ng Aβ per gram of brain tissue. Levels of Aβ*56
were assessed by comparing the density of the 56-kilodalton band to known
quantities of synthetic Aβ monomers on Western blots probed with 6E10.
This method assumes that the affinity of the 6E10 antibody was the same for the
Aβ peptides within Aβ*56 as for the synthetic Aβ, in blots
subjected to antigen retrieval prior to incubation with 6E10. Our estimate of
the amount of Aβ*56 depends upon the stoichiometry of antibody binding to
the synthetic standards and to Aβ*56. We assume a stoichiometry of
antibody:Aβ monomer of 1:1. Each molecule of Aβ*56, a putative
Aβ dodecamer, could bind between 1 and 12 antibody molecules. Under the
assumption that one molecule of Aβ*56 binds 12 antibodies (i.e., a 1:1
antibody:monomeric sub-unit ratio) , we found that Aβ*56 contains 57
± 2 ng Aβ per gram of brain tissue. However, this value could be
as much as 12 times higher, if only one antibody binds to each molecule of
Aβ*56. Finally, the total mass of Aβ (Aβ x-38 ,
Aβ x-40 , and Aβ x-42 ) in the extracts was
measured by ELISA using 6E10 antibodies, following denaturation with formic
acid. We found that the total Aβ in aqueous extracts from aged Tg2576
mice is comprised of 0.4% - 4.8% Aβ*56, and ~95% Type 2 Aβo
( Table 1 ; Figure S5 ).

Multiple studies have shown a correlation between the Type 1 Aβo
Aβ*56 and memory dysfunction in transgenic mice ( Billings et al., 2007 ; Cheng
et al., 2007 ; Lesne et al.,
2006 ). rTg9191 mice provide the opportunity to test the effects of
Type 2 Aβo on cognition, as rTg9191 mice produce Type 2 Aβo
exclusively. We studied cognitive function in rTg9191 mice that were aged until
21 to 24 months, when the relative quantity of Type 2 Aβo in the brain,
as assessed in dot blots using OC antibodies, was comparable to that in AD
patients ( Figures 6A and 6B ). In a cohort
of mice tested at 23 months, we found no significant transgene-associated
effects on cognitive performance in the fixed consecutive number task, an
operant behavioral task sensitive to lesions of the prefrontal cortex ( van Haaren et al., 1988 ) ( Figure 6C ). Similarly, we found no
significant impairment of spatial memory in any of three other cohorts of mice
[young (4 months); middle-aged (12 months); old (21 months)] evaluated using a
water maze test of spatial reference memory that is sensitive to hippocampal
lesions ( Morris, 2007 ) ( Figure 6D ). When the cohort of old mice was
re-tested at 24 months, when levels of Type 2 Aβo were significantly
higher than in 21-month-old mice, there was still no decrement in performance
( Table S1 ).
Furthermore, there were no significant differences in performances between the
old cohort (21-month-old) and the other two cohorts ( Figure 6D , Table S1 ). The slight increase in the proximity index ( Table S1 ) and decrease in
target-quadrant occupancy in the old mice appear to be related to aging since
the same decrease can be seen in old, non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 6D ). Based on OC-immunoreactivity in
dot blots, the levels of Type 2 Aβo in 24-month-old mice were 25- and
2.1-fold greater (calculated after subtracting background immunoreactivity
observed in non-transgenic mice) than those in 4- and 12-month-old mice,
respectively ( Figure 6B ). In summary,
within the statistical limits of our measurements, there were no differences in
cognitive function between mice with Type 2 Aβo (at levels comparable to
those in humans with AD), non-transgenic mice, and young rTg9191 mice with few
or no such oligomers.

The absence of any impact on cognitive function of Type 2 Aβo
produced in situ suggests that Type 2 Aβo sequestered
within dense-core plaques do not interfere with global network function, or that
compensatory neural reorganization effectively preserves brain function when the
oligomers occupy <15% of the cortex. It is possible that the background
strain (129FVBF1) of rTg9191 is not permissive for the disruptive effects of
Aβ on cognition, but this is unlikely, because Tg2576 mice in the same
background strain showed spatial memory deficits ( Kotilinek et al., 2008 ). We also considered the possibility
that the Type 2 Aβo produced by rTg9191 mice lack neurotoxicity. To test
this hypothesis, we prepared aqueous protein extracts containing Type 2
Aβo from the brains of 26-month-old rTg9191 mice and injected the
extracts into the lateral cerebral ventricles of rats previously trained in a
delayed non-matching-to-place task, a test of short-term working memory ( Paule et al., 1998 ). Each rat sequentially
received brain extracts containing ~0% (Aβ-immunodepletion),
~0.1% (low dose) or ~1% (high dose) of the total amount of Type 2
Aβo in a 26-month-old rTg9191 mouse, and was tested two hours after the
injections. Compared to baseline performance, memory was significantly impaired
when rats were injected with the high dose of Aβ-containing extracts, but
not when rats received the low dose or extracts from which Aβ was
depleted ( Figures 6E and S6 ). These results
indicate that normal cognition in rTg9191 mice is probably not due to the lack
of neurotoxicity of Type 2 Aβo, since extracts containing minute
quantities of dispersed Type 2 Aβo disrupted cognition. These findings
support the conclusion that spatial localization is a more significant
determinant of the neurological effects of Aβo than overall
abundance.

## Discussion
The data in this paper indicate that brain-derived Aβo can be
categorized based upon distinct temporal, spatial and structural relationships to
fibrils. Type 2 Aβo are observed only after dense-core plaque formation, are
highly concentrated around dense-core plaques, and are recognized by OC antibodies,
which we here show selectively bind to structures containing in-register parallel
β-sheets. The in-register parallel β-sheet conformation is
characteristic of all known naturally occurring Aβ fibrils (for review, see
( Glabe, 2009 ; Tycko, 2011 )), so it appears that Type 2 Aβo and
Aβ fibrils share a common quaternary structure. By contrast, Type 1
Aβo are present both prior to and following the appearance of dense-core
plaques, are dispersed in brain tissue, and are recognized by A11 antibodies.
Importantly, these two classes of Aβo are differentially associated with
impaired cognition: the Type 1 Aβo Aβ*56 is associated with memory
dysfunction in APP transgenic mice ( Billings et al.,
2007 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ; Lesne et al., 2006 ; Lesne et al., 2008 ), while mice with levels of Type 2 oligomers
similar to those of AD patients have intact cognition. These results are summarized
in Table S2 . Taken
together, these findings refine our understanding of how Aβo are organized
and impact global neural network function in the brain.

The results of recently reported behavioral studies in
TetO-APP SweInd mice are consistent with our conclusion that Type 2
Aβo are less harmful to neurological function than Type 1 Aβo ( Fowler et al., 2014 ). Using
TetO-APP SweInd mice of the identical age and strain background,
exposed to the same dose of doxycycline for the same amount of time as the mice used
here, Fowler et al. showed that 90% suppression of APP expression led to cognitive
improvement, assayed with multiple behavioral tests. Cognitive improvement in these
mice was accompanied by significant reductions in the level of A11-immunoreactive
species generally, and in the level of Aβ*56 particularly, with no changes in
amyloid plaque burden. In the current study, we have confirmed the findings of
Fowler et al., showing that suppression of APP leads to reductions in
A11-immunoreacitve species, and have extended these findings to show that levels of
OC-immunoreactive Aβo are unchanged. To summarize, an experimental
manipulation that reduces levels of A11-reactive Aβo, while preserving levels
of OC-reactive Aβo, leads to cognitive improvement in
TetO-APP SweInd mice.

We hypothesize that the differences in the spatiotemporal distributions of
Type 1 and Type 2 Aβo result from distinct modes of biogenesis. Aβo
have been shown in vitro to form via one of two processes: primary
self-assembly occurring independently of amyloid fibrils, or secondary self-assembly
requiring pre-existing fibrils that catalyze the self-assembly of monomers ( Cohen et al., 2013 ) ( Figure S7 ). If these
processes also occur in vivo , Aβo formed via secondary
self-assembly should be seen only in brains containing amyloid fibrils and should be
at highest concentration in the immediate vicinity of foci of Aβ fibrils
(i.e., dense-core plaques). We propose that Type 2 Aβo are generated by a
secondary self-assembly process, because they appear only after dense-core plaques
are present and they are highly concentrated around these plaques. Conversely,
Aβo that form via primary self-assembly may be present prior to plaque
formation and need not be concentrated around plaques – characteristics of
Type 1 Aβo, as defined here.

The two-pathway model of the self-assembly of Aβ ( Figure S7 ) can explain the
quantitative differences between Type 1 and Type 2 Aβo reported here. In vitro studies have shown that, in the presence of amyloid
fibrils, reaction kinetics favor the generation of oligomers via a secondary
self-assembly process ( Cohen et al., 2013 ).
After amyloid fibrils form in vitro , Aβ monomers are
consumed by the elongation of fibrils and the secondary self-assembly reaction; if
the consumption of monomers by these processes exceeds the production of Aβ
monomers needed to form Aβo via primary self-assembly, then Aβo formed
by primary self-assembly will decline or disappear. This model predicts that Type 2
Aβo should predominate in plaque-bearing brains; indeed, Type 2 Aβo
are the most abundant Aβo in aged Tg2576 mice, comprising ~95% of the
Aβ species in aqueous brain extracts from Tg2576 mice (with plaque loads
slightly higher than those found in AD). The model also anticipates our result in vivo in TetO-APP SweInd mice − when we
reduced the pool of monomers by lowering APP expression, levels of Type 1 Aβo
fell but levels of Type 2 Aβo remained unchanged. Finally, the presence of
Type 1 Aβo in Tg2576 mice and their absence in rTg9191 is also consistent
with this model. Tg2576 mice express more total Aβ than rTg9191 mice, but
relatively less fibrillogenic Aβ42, because Tg2576 lack the London mutation; therefore, more monomers are available to form
Type 1 Aβo in Tg2576 than in rTg9191 mice.

Surprisingly, the prolific Type 2 Aβo were not dispersed throughout
brain tissue, but were instead encapsulated around dense-core plaques that in total
occupied <15% of the cortex. Within this microenvironment, Type 2 Aβo
very likely cause neurodegenerative changes such as dystrophic neurites. It was
previously shown that anti-Aβ immunotherapy reverses plaque-associated
neuritic abnormalities without affecting plaque burden ( Rozkalne et al., 2009 ), strongly suggesting that soluble
Aβo cause cytopathology. Our rTg9191 mice, which generate only Type 2
Aβo, exhibit plaque-associated cytopathology ( Liu et al., in press ), yet remain cognitively normal. Thus, the
encapsulation of Type 2 Aβo in cyst-like dense-core plaques appears to
neutralize their potential to disrupt neurological function. These results indicate
that the spatial localization of Aβo is critically important, certainly more
important than their overall abundance.

To evaluate the relevance of our findings to AD, we estimated the volume of
human cortex occupied by Type 2 Aβo in AD, using two different methods. One
method depended upon immunohistological data of tissue stained with the Aβ
oligomer-specific antibody NAB-61 ( Lee et al.,
2006 ), which we inferred selectively recognizes Type 2 Aβo and
amyloid fibrils from its almost exclusive staining of neuritic plaques (dense-core
plaques associated with neuritic abnormalities ( Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011 )). The average volume of AD cortex occupied by
Aβ assemblies detected using NAB-61 was ~5% ( Perez-Nievas et al., 2013 ). The other method relied upon
neuritic plaque densities. We estimated that the upper limit of the volume of cortex
occupied by neuritic plaques in AD brain is ~10% (see Note S1 ). Both estimates are
smaller than those in the two mouse model systems studied here, suggesting that in
humans, Type 2 Aβo influence a relatively small volume of cortex and, as in
the mice, would participate little if at all in disrupting cognition or inducing
widespread neurodegeneration. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Type 2
Aβo might disrupt intrinsic connectivity networks in AD if
higher-than-average concentrations of neuritic plaques accumulate in critical
“nodes.” Nor can we conclude with certainty that Type 1 Aβ
oligomer levels are equivalent across all brain regions; for example, within a given
region, local rates of Aβ production may be affected by neural activity
( Cirrito et al., 2005 ; Kamenetz et al., 2003 ), which might alter the
kinetics of self-assembly. A better understanding of the roles of Type 1 and Type 2
Aβo in AD might be gained by comparing their respective levels in brain
regions that are differentially vulnerable to neurodegenerative and functional
abnormalities.

Although the biological factors involved in maintaining the sequestration of
Type 2 Aβo in dense-core plaques are not well understood, neuroinflammation
seems to be important. While Type 2 Aβo are smaller and therefore more
diffusible than amyloid fibrils, their diffusion range may be circumscribed by
microglial cells that may “seal” them inside amyloid plaques ( Bolmont et al., 2008 ), thus potentially limiting
their influence on brain function. It is possible that the compartmentalization
eventually breaks down in symptomatic AD patients, allowing Type 2 Aβo to
leak out and damage a broader population of neurons. If Type 2 Aβo in AD are
as neurotoxic as those in rTg9191 mice, our results indicate that small breaches
allowing only ~1% to pass through the putative barrier might be sufficient to
disrupt global network function. Actual quantification is needed to test the
hypothesis directly, but the poor correlation between neuritic plaques,
β-amyloidosis, and cognition in humans ( Katzman et al., 1988 ; Terry et al.,
1991 ) argues against this possibility.

The uncertainty about which Aβo contribute to the pathogenesis of AD
is a major impediment to progress on disease prevention, treatment and diagnosis.
Apparently conflicting results obtained in clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies
highlight the need for a more complete understanding of the types and toxicity of
Aβ assemblies that are seen during the progression of AD. Passive
immunization with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize Aβ fibrils,
Bapineuzumab and Gantenerumab, reduced amyloid burdens but failed to provide
cognitive or functional benefits ( Alzforum,
2015a , b ; Ostrowitzki et al., 2012 ; Rinne
et al., 2010 ). However, preliminary reports that a third antibody,
Aducanumab, practically eliminates plaques and slows cognitive and
functional decline in patients with prodromal or mild AD has generated tremendous
excitement in the field ( Strobel, 2015 ).
Aducanumab reportedly is highly selective for Aβo over Aβ monomers,
but further details of the conformational selectivity of the antibody have not been
made public. Taken together with the findings in mice reported here, the results of
the clinical trials raise several questions: How did the stage at which therapy was
administered, the degree of target engagement, and/or the precise identities of
Aβ species targeted contribute to the differences in the outcomes of the
clinical trials? Does Aducanumab discriminate between Type 1 and Type 2 Aβo,
as defined here, or does it recognize an epitope common to both types of Aβo?
Does the microlocalization of different structural classes of Aβo in human
brain parallel that seen in the brains of APP transgenic mice, reported here, and
does this spatial distribution change during the progression of AD from the
prodromal phase to dementia? Are there regions of the human brain where Type 2
Aβo reach a high enough concentration to disrupt network function (the
critical “nodes” mentioned above)?

In summary, the findings reported here suggest that while most of the
soluble Aβ in brains bearing dense-core plaques (e.g., AD brains) are Type 2
Aβo, the bulk of these oligomers are rendered functionally innocuous by their
effective containment within plaques. Type 1 Aβo may be more directly
pathogenic in many brain regions because they are more finely dispersed than Type 2
Aβo. We hope that our findings will open up new directions of research,
particularly in understanding and developing therapies that target the rarer Type 1
Aβo. A better understanding of how Type 1 and Type 2 Aβo impact the
pathogenesis of AD may result from the synthesis of future biophysical and
biological studies.

## Experimental Procedures
rTg9191 mice were generated using a binary system of responder and
activator transgenes ( Paulson et al.,
2008 ). Tg2576 mice ( Hsiao et al.,
1996 ) in a B6SJLF1 background ( Westerman et al., 2002 ) and 4-month-old hAPP-J20 mice in a C57Bl6
background were from K.H.A.'s colony at the University of Minnesota.
TetO-APP SweInd mice in a B6FVB F1 background were from J.L.J.'s
laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine. Brains from 12-month-old hAPP-J20 were
a gift of Dr. Lennart Mucke of the University of California, San Francisco. All
experiments involving mice and rats were conducted in full accordance with the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at the University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center, or Baylor College
of Medicine.

De-identified samples of inferior temporal gyrus (Brodmann Area 20) from
individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were obtained from
the Religious Order Study (Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Chicago, IL).

Details of preparation procedures are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures .

To extract native Aβ aggregates, water-soluble extracts were
prepared based on a protocol previously described ( Shankar et al., 2008 ). Briefly, tissue specimens were
weighed and transferred to 4 volumes of ice-cold buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4;
140 mM NaCl; 3 mM KCl; 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 0.2 mM
1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate; protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO); and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich)) and homogenized
using a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting materials were centrifuged for 90
minutes (16,100 g ; 4°C); the supernatant was depleted of
endogenous immunoglobulins and stored at -20°C until further use.

Details of the dot blotting method are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures . Briefly, 0.5 μg protein from brain
extracts or 0.02-2 ng synthetic Aβ fibrils ( Qiang et al., 2012 ) were spotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes, which were then probed with either OC (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
AB2286, 1:50,000) or A11 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, AHB0052, 1:1,000)
antibodies.

Detergent-soluble Aβ species were extracted and Western blotting
was performed using the method of Liu et al. ( Liu et al., 2011 ).

Details of micro-dissection are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures . Native and detergent-soluble proteins were
extracted as described above; to compare protein levels in the micro-dissected
fractions, extracts from equal volumes of tissue were used in dot blots and
Western blots. For negative controls, protein extracts from age-matched,
nontransgenic littermates were loaded such that the total protein content
equaled that of the plaque-free regions used for each blot.

Details of the behavioral tests are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures .

Forty-one (19 rTg9191, 22 “neg”) mice completed
training under this assay. Mice were 20.5-month-old at the start of
training. After training, mice were run under the FCN-4 five days per week
for 30 daily sessions.

Spatial reference memory was measured in rTg9191 mice using a
modified version of a water maze tailored to more rapid learning in the
129S6/FVB background strain and more sensitive to subtle deficits ( Westerman et al., 2002 ). rTg9191 mice
(female and male) were tested cross-sectionally at 4 and 12 months of age,
and longitudinally from 21 to 24 months. The spatial cues and hidden
platform location were changed for the mice tested longitudinally at 24
months of age. Illness and spontaneous deaths were observed at the 21-24
month time point (4/60 “neg” and 6/40 rTg9191 mice, Chi Square
p = 0.15). Mice requiring euthanasia were not included in the analysis. The
power of our study was sufficient to have an 80% chance of detecting an
8-point drop in mean percent target quadrant occupancy at a confidence level
of 0.05.

Twenty male Sprague Dawley rats previously trained on a Delayed
Non-Matching to Position task were injected intracerebroventricularly with
brain extracts through chronically implanted guide cannulae ( Reed et al., 2011 ). Each rat received
10 μL brain extract, prepared using the protocol for native
aggregates described above; control extracts were prepared by two rounds of
immunodepletion with monoclonal antibody 4G8. Animals were tested 2 hours
post-injection. Each animal received injections of both fibril-dependent
Aβ oligomer-containing and control extracts, on different days.

The task yields an accuracy-by-delay relationship, with high
accuracy (percent of correct responses) at the short delays and near random
performance (50% correct) at the longest delays. This relationship is
shifted leftwards (working memory deficit) by compounds or conditions that
adversely affect cognition. Performance on the day of injection was compared
to baseline performance, defined as the mean of the scores at each delay
(per cent correct choices) for three days contiguous to the day of
injection. Two animals that lost their cannulae were excluded from the
analysis.
