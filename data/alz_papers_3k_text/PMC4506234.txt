# Title
Structural and functional features of central nervous system lymphatics

# Abstract
One of the characteristics of the CNS is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the CNS undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment 1 – 3 , the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the CNS remain poorly understood 4 – 6 . In searching for T cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the CSF, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the CNS. The discovery of the CNS lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and shed new light on the etiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.

## Methods
Male and female C57Bl/6 , NOD.Cd11c-YFP and Prox1 tdT mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were housed in temperature and humidity controlled rooms, maintained on a 12h/12h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00am). All strains were kept in identical housing conditions. All procedures complied with regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Virginia. Only adult animals (eight to ten weeks) were used in this study. Sample size was chosen in accordance with similar, previously published experiment. Animals from different cages in the same experimental group were selected to assure randomization. For all experiments, investigators were blinded from the time of sacrifice to the end of the analysis.

Autopsy specimens of human dura including the superior sagittal sinus were obtained from the Departments of Pathology and Neurosurgery at the University of Virginia. All samples are from consenting patients that gave no restriction to the use of their body for research and teaching (through the Virginia Anatomical Board, Richmond, VA). All obtained samples were fixed and stored in a 10% formalin solution for prolonged time periods.

Mice were euthanized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Euthasol and perfused with 0.1M of PBS for 5 min. Skin was removed from the head and the muscle were stripped of the bone. After removal of the mandibles and the skull rostral to maxillae, the top of the skull was removed with surgical scissors. Whole mount meninges were fixed while still attached to the skull cap in PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24h at 4°C or in 1:1 ethanol:acetone solution for 20 min at −20°C depending on the antibody. The dura/arachnoid was then dissected from the skullcap. For analysis of the pia mater, brains extracted from the skull were flash frozen, and 40μm-thick transverse sections were sliced using a cryostat (Leica). Choroid plexus was dissected out of the ventricles of non-fixed brain and fixed with 2% PFA in PBS for 24h. For coronal sectioning of whole mount meninges, 100 μl of matrigel (Corning) was injected into the dural sinuses prior to dissection. The meninges (dura mater/arachnoid) were dissected from the skullcap, flash frozen, and 10 μm thick sections were cut using a cryostat, and the slices were placed on gelatin-coated slides.

Whole mounts and sections were incubated with PBS containing 2% of normal serum (either goat or chicken), 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X-100 and 0.05% of Tween 20 for 1h at room temperature (RT), followed by incubation with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies: anti-CD31 (eBioscience, clone 390, 1:100); anti-CD3e (eBioscience, clone 17A2, 1:500), anti-MHC II (eBioscience, clone M5/114.15.2, 1:500), anti-Lyve-1 (eBioscience, clone ALY7, 1:200), anti-Prox1 (Angiobio, 11-002, 1:500), anti-podoplanin (eBioscience, clone 8.1.1, 1:100), anti-VEGFR3 (R&D Systems, AF743, 1:100), anti-αSMA (Sigma-Aldrich, clone 1A4, 1:500), anti-VE-Cadherin (eBioscience, clone BV13 1:100), anti-Claudin-5 (Molecular Probes, 352588, 1:200), anti-CCL21 (R&D Systems, AF457, 1:100), anti integrin-α9 (R&D Systems, AF3827, 1:100), anti-B220 (eBioscience, clone RA3-6B2, 1:100), anti CD11c (eBioscience, clone N418, 1:100) O/N at 4°C in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0,5% Triton-X-100. Whole mounts and sections were then washed 3 times for 5 min at RT in PBS followed by incubation with Alexa-fluor 488/594/647 chicken/goat anti rabbit/goat IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:1000) or PE/Cy3 conjugated streptavidin (eBioscience, 1:1000) for 1h at RT in PBS with 1% BSA and 0,5% Triton-X-100. After 5 min in 1:10 000 DAPI reagent, whole mount and section were washed with PBS and mounted with Aqua-Mount (Lerner) under coverslips. For the pre-absorption experiments, the anti-VEGFR3 and anti-podoplanin antibodies were incubated respectively with recombinant mouse VEGFR3 (743-R3-100, R&D Systems) or recombinant mouse podoplanin (3244-PL-050, R&D Systems) at the concentration ratio of 1:10 O/N at 4°C in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton-X-100 prior to staining.

For human samples, formalin-fixed superior sagittal sinuses were dissected in 2 mm thick sections and fixed overnight (O/N) in PBS with 4% PFA. Tissues were then embedded in OCT and 10 μm thick sections were sliced onto gelatin-coated slides on a cryostat (Leica). Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation of the slides for 20 min in sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 80° C. After washing with PBS, endogenous biotins were blocked with a 30 min incubation in PBS with 3% H 2 O 2 , then the slides were blocked in PBS containing 2% of normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1h at RT. Slides were then incubated O/N at 4°C with anti-Lyve-1 (ab36993, Abcam, 1:200), anti-podoplanin (HPA007534, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:200) or anti-CD68 (HPA048982, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton-X-100. Sections were then washed 3 times for 5 minutes at RT in PBS followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:1000) for 1h at RT, then for 30 min at RT with ABC kit solutions (VECTASTAIN, Vector Labs). Slides were then incubated with the peroxidase substrate DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) for several minutes, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in Cytoseal 60 (Thermo Scientific) under coverslips. Nine human samples were labeled and analyzed; the lymphatic structures were identified in two of them.

Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal system (Leica Microsystems) using the LAS AF Software. For the images of the complete whole mount, images were acquired with a 10× objective with 0.25 NA. Other confocal images were acquired using a 20× objective with 0.70 NA or a 40× oil immersion objective with 1.30 NA. All images were acquired with at a 512×512 pixel resolution and with a z-step of 4μm. Quantitative assessments were performed using FIJI software (NIH). Percentage of luminal T cells was determined by counting the number of T cells with luminal localization in the sinuses area. T cell density was established by dividing the number of T lymphocytes by the area of meninges. Prox1-positive cell density was defined by dividing the number of Prox1 nuclei by the area of lymphatic vessels. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Specific statistical tests are presented in the text for each experiment. Outlier samples were eliminated using the Grubbs’ test with a significance level of 0.01 (only for the rh-VEGF-c experiment). No estimate of variation between groups was performed.

Meninges were harvested as previously described and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M cacodylate buffer with 0.15% potassium ferrocyanide. After rinsing in buffer, the tissue was dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to propylene oxide, infiltrated and embedded in epoxy resin and polymerized at 70°C O/N. Semi-thin sections (0.5 microns) were stained with toluidine blue for light microscope examination. Ultrathin sections (80nm) were cut (Integrated microscopy center, University of Memphis) and imaged using the Tecnai TF20 TEM with an AMT XR41 camera ( Extended Data Fig. 5i ; Integrated microscopy center, University of Memphis) or using the Tecnai F20 TEM with an UltraScan CCD camera ( Fig. 2h ; Advanced Microscopy core, University of Virginia).

Mice were anaesthetized by ketamine/xylazine injection i.p. and injected i.c.v. (into the cisterna magna) with 5μl of QDot655 (Invitrogen) or 5μl of Alexa488-conjugated anti-Lyve-1 antibody (ALY7, eBioscience). Mice were co-injected i.v. with 25μl of 10% fluorescein sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) or 5μl of QDot655 (Invitrogen). Meningeal lymphatic vessels were imaged through a thinned skull preparation. The core temperature of the mice was monitored and maintained at 37°C. Imaging was performed with a Leica TCS SP8 multiphoton microscopy system (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Chameleon Ultra II tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent). GFP and QDot655 were excited with an excitation wavelength of 880 nm. Images were obtained using a 25× water immersion objective with 0.95 NA and external HyD non-descanned detectors (Leica Microsystems). Four-dimensional imaging data were collected by obtaining images from the x, y, and z-planes over time. The resulting images were analyzed with Imaris software (Bitplane).

To assess the abluminal localization of the sinusal T cells, mice were injected i.v. with 10μg of FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (eBioscience, clone 30-F11) or control isotype 1h prior to euthanasia. To assess that the meningeal lymphatic vessels are not part of the cardiovasculature, mice were injected with 100μl of DyLight 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum Lectin (Vector Laboratories) 5 min prior to euthanasia.

Mice were injected i.c.v. with 4μg of rh-VEGF-c (Cys156Ser, R&D Systems) or with PBS. Meninges were harvested 7 and 14 days after the injection.

Mice were anaesthetized by ketamine/xylazine injection i.p., and then 5μl of 10% Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected i.c.v. into the cisterna magna or intranasally. Thirty minutes after injection, mice were euthanized with CO 2 and the CNS draining lymph nodes were dissected for assessment of Evans blue content. The dura mater was also harvested to analyze Evans Blue localization using confocal microscopy. The intensity of the Evans blue was measured using the plot profile function of FIJI.

Mice were perfused with 0.1M PBS for 5min. Heads were removed and skulls were quickly stripped. Mandibles were removed, as well as all skull material rostral to maxillae. Surgical scissors were used to remove the top of the skull, cutting clockwise, beginning and ending inferior to the right post-tympanic hook. Meninges (dura mater, arachnoid and pia mater) were carefully removed from the interior aspect of the skulls and surfaces of the brain with Dumont #5 forceps (Fine Science Tools). Meninges were gently pressed through 70μm nylon mesh cell strainers with sterile plastic plunger (BD Biosciences) to yield a single cell suspension. For lymphatic endothelial cells isolation, meninges (along with diaphragm and ear skin) were digested for 1h in 0.41U/ml of Liberase TM (Roche) and 60U/ml of DNAse1. Cells were then centrifuged at 280 g at 4°C for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (pH 7,4; 0.1M PBS; 1mM EDTA: 1% BSA). Cells were stained for extracellular marker with antibodies to CD45-PacificBlue (BD Bioscience), CD45-PE-Cy7 or eFluor 450 (eBioscience), TCRβ-Alexa780 (eBioscience), CD4-Alexa488 (eBioscience), CD8-PerCPCy5.5 (eBioscience), CD44-APC (eBioscience), CD62L-PE (eBioscience), CD71-APC (eBioscience), podoplanin-PE (eBioscience), CD31-Alexa647 (eBioscience), B220-PE (eBioscience), CD19-BB515 (BD Bioscience). Except for the lymphatic endothelial cells identification experiment, all cells were fixed in 1% PFA in 0.1M pH 7.4 PBS. Fluorescence data were collected with a CyAn ADP High-Performance Flow Cytometer (Dako) or a Gallios (Beckman Coulter) then analyzed using Flowjo software (Treestar). To obtain accurate cells counts, single cells were gated using the height, area and the pulse width of the forward and side scatter, then cells were selected for being live cells using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were then gated for the appropriate markers for cell type ( Extended Data Fig. 3 , 9 ). Experiments were performed on meninges from n = 3 mice per group. Data processing was done with Excel and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism.

Eight-week old mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, shaved at the neck and cleaned with iodine and 70% ethanol, and an ophthalmic solution was put on the eyes to prevent drying. An incision was made midline 5mm superior to the clavicle. The sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) was retracted, and the deep cervical lymph node was removed with forceps. For the ligation experiment, the collecting lymphatic vessels anterior to the deep cervical lymph nodes were ligated using a nylon suture (9-0 Ethilon black 6”VAS100-4). Sham-operated mice received the incision and had the SCM retracted, but were not ligated or the lymph nodes were not removed. Mice were then sutured and allowed to recover on a heating pad until responsive. Post surgery, mice were given analgesic to the drinking water: 50mg/l for 3 days post surgery and 0.16mg for the next 2 weeks.

Representative images of T cells (CD3e, arrowheads) in the dura/arachnoid, pia, dural sinuses, and choroid plexus (scale bar = 70 μm). c . Quantification of T cell density in different meningeal compartments (mean ± SEM; n =6 animals each group; ***p<0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test). d . Quantification of MHCII-expressing cells in different meningeal compartments (mean ± SEM; n = 6 animals each group; ***p<0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test). e . Adult mice were injected i.v. with 100μl of DyLight 488 lectin 5 min prior to sacrifice to enable labeling of the cardiovascular system. Meninges were harvested and stained with anti-CD3e. Representative orthogonal images of T cell localization in the lumen (white arrowhead) and outside of the sinus (yellow arrowhead; n=2 mice; scale bar = 70 μm). f . Adult mice were injected i.v. with 10μg of FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody or FITC-conjugated isotype antibody. Meninges were harvested one hour after the injection and labeled with anti-CD3e. Representative images of CD3e immunolabeling around dural sinuses are shown. CD45 positive cells do not co-localize with CD3 + cells (a), suggesting an abluminal localization of the later (n = 2 mice each group; scale bar = 20 μm). g . Representative 3D reconstruction of the lymphatic vessels localization around the superior sagittal sinus. Adult mice were injected i.v. with 100μl of DyLight 488 lectin 5 min prior to sacrifice in order to stain the cardiovascular system. Meninges were harvested and labeled with anti-Lyve-1. The lack of lectin staining in the Lyve-1-positive meningeal lymphatic vessels suggests that they are independent of the cardiovascular system (n = 3 mice; scale bars = 50 μm and 120 μm). The mounting of the whole meninges results in the flattening of the sinus, thus it does not appear tubular.
