## Online methods
The following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory), C57BL/6 aged mice (National Institutes of Aging), β2-Microglobulin ( B2m −/− ) mutant mice and transporter associated with antigen processing 1 ( Tap1 −/− ) mutant mice (The Jackson Laboratory). All studies were done in male mice. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences was calculated using standard power calculations with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool ( http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html ) to calculate power and sample size based on experience with the respective tests, variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12 h light-dark cycle and all animal handling and use was in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the University of California San Francisco IACUC and the VA Palo Alto Committee on Animal Research.

Parabiosis surgery followed previously described procedures 6 , 7 . Mirror-image incisions at the left and right flanks were made through the skin and shorter incisions were made through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal openings of the adjacent parabionts were sutured together. Elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together and the skin of each mouse was stapled (9mm Autoclip, Clay Adams) to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with Baytril antibiotic and Buprenex as directed for pain and monitored during recovery. For overall health and maintenance behavior, several recovery characteristics were analyzed at various times after surgery, including paired weights and grooming behavior.

Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (2L/min oxygen flow rate) delivered through an anesthesia nose cone. Ophthalmic eye ointment (Puralube Vet Ointment, Dechra) was applied to the cornea to prevent desiccation during surgery. The area around the incision was trimmed. Solutions were injected bilaterally into the DG of the dorsal hippocampi using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −2mm, lateral = 1.5mm, (from skull surface) height = −2.1mm. A 2 μl volume was injected stereotaxically over 10 minutes (injection speed: 0.20μl/min) using a 5 μl 26s gauge Hamilton syringe. To limit reflux along the injection track, the needle was maintained in situ for 8 minutes, slowly pulled out half way and kept in position for an additional two minutes. The skin was closed using silk suture. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with the analgesic Buprenex. Mice were single-housed and monitored during recovery.

Carrier free purified human β2-Microglobulin (Lee Biosolutions) was dissolved in PBS and administered systemically (100 ug/kg) via intraorbital injections in young (3 months) wild type animals, or stereotaxically (0.50ul; 0.1ug/ul) into the DG of the hippocampus in young (3 months) wild type and Tap1 −/− mice. For histological analysis B2M and vehicle were administered into contralateral DG of the same animal. For behavioral analysis B2M or vehicle were administered bilaterally into the DG and mice were allowed to recover for six or 30 days prior to cognitive testing.

For short term Brdu labeling 50 mg/kg of BrdU was injected intraperitoneally into mice daily either three or six days before sacrifice. For long term BrdU labeling 50 mg/kg of BrdU was injected into mice once a day for six days and animals were sacrificed 28 days after first administration. To estimate the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the brain, we performed DAB staining for BrdU on every sixth hemibrain section for a total of six sections. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell and subgranular cell layer of the DG were counted and multiplied by 12 to estimate the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the entire DG. To determine the fate of dividing cells a total of 200 BrdU-positive cells across 4–6 sections per mouse were analyzed by confocal microscopy for co-expression with NeuN and GFAP. The number of double-positive cells was expressed as a percentage of BrdU-positive cells.

Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry was performed on free-floating sections following standard published techniques 6 . Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline. Brains were removed and fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 48 h before they were sunk through 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were then sectioned coronally at 40 μm with a cryomicrotome (Leica Camera, Inc.) and stored in cryoprotective medium. Primary antibodies were: goat anti-Dcx (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-8066, clone: C-18), rat anti-BrdU (1:5000, Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.; ab6326, clone: BU1/75), mouse anti-Nestin (1:500; Millipore; MAB353; clone: rat-401), MCM2 (1:500, BD Biosciences; 610700; clone: 46/BM28), chicken anti-Tbr2 (1:500; Millipore; AB15894), mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000; Millipore; MAB377; clone: A60), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500; DAKO; Z0334). After overnight incubation, primary antibody staining was revealed using biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector) and the ABC kit (Vector) with Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich) or fluorescence conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies). For BrdU labeling, brain sections were pre-treated with 2N HCl at 37°C for 30 min and washed three times with Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween (TBST) before incubation with primary antibody. For Nestin and Tbr2 labeling, brain sections were pre-treated three times with 0.1M Citrate at 95°C for 5 min and washed three times with Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween (TBST) before incubation with primary antibody. To estimate the total number of Dcx positive cells per DG immunopositive cells in the granule cell and subgranular cell layer of the DG were counted in every sixth coronal hemibrain section through the hippocampus for a total of six sections and multiplied by 12.

Mouse hippocampi were dissected after perfusion of animals, snap frozen and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (500 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, and complete protease inhibitors; Roche). Tissue lysates were mixed with 4× NuPage LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded on a 4–12% SDS polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween (TBST) and incubated with rabbit anti-actin (1:5000, Sigma; A5060) and rabbit anti-B2M (1:2500, Abcam; ab75853; clone: EP2978Y). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, GE Healthcare; NA934) and an ECL kit (GE Healthcare/Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to detect protein signals. Multiple exposures were taken to select images within the dynamic range of the film (GE Healthcare Amersham HyperfilmTM ECL). Selected films were scanned (300 dpi) and quantified using ImageJ software (Version 1.46k). Actin bands were used for normalization.

Mouse neural progenitor cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice or Dcx-reporter mice 37 as previously described 6 , 38 . Brains from postnatal animals (1 day-old) were dissected to remove olfactory bulbs, cortex, cerebellum and brainstem. After removing superficial blood vessels hippocampi were finely minced with a scalpel, digested for 30 minutes at 37°C in DMEM media containing 2.5U/ml Papain (Worthington Biochemicals), 1U/ml Dispase II (Boeringher Mannheim), and 250U/ml DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals) and mechanically dissociated. NSC/progenitors were purified using a 65% Percoll gradient and plated on uncoated tissue culture dishes at a density of 10 5 cells/cm 2 . NPCs were cultured under standard conditions for 48 hours in NeuroBasal A medium supplemented with penicillin (100U/ml), streptomycin (100mg/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine, serum-free B27 supplement without vitamin A (Sigma-Aldrich), bFGF (20ng/ml) and EGF (20ng/ml). Carrier free forms of human recombinant B2M (Vendor) were dissolved in PBS and added to cell cultures under self-renewal conditions every other day following cell plating. For proliferation BrdU incorporation was measured using a cell proliferation assay system that uses a peroxidase-coupled anti-BrdU antibody together with a color substrate for detection (Fisher). For bioluminescence assays Dcx-luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega). Differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemistry using mouse anti-MAP2 (1:1000, Sigma; M9942; clone: HM-2) and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, DAKO; Z0334) antibodies. Cytotoxicity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detection using a Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay system (Life Technologies).

In this task, mice learned to associate the environmental context (fear conditioning chamber) with an aversive stimulus (mild foot shock; unconditioned stimulus, US) enabling testing for hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning. As contextual fear conditioning is hippocampus and amygdala dependent, the mild foot shock was paired with a light and tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) in order to also assess amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning. Conditioned fear was displayed as freezing behavior. Specific training parameters are as follows: tone duration is 30 seconds; level is 70 dB, 2 kHz; shock duration is 2 seconds; intensity is 0.6 mA. This intensity is not painful and can easily be tolerated but will generate an unpleasant feeling. More specifically, on day 1 each mouse was placed in a fear-conditioning chamber and allowed to explore for 2 minutes before delivery of a 30-second tone (70 dB) ending with a 2-second foot shock (0.6mA). Two minutes later, a second CS-US pair was delivered. On day 2 each mouse was first place in the fear-conditioning chamber containing the same exact context, but with no CS or foot shock. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 minutes. One hour later, the mice were placed in a new context containing a different odor, cleaning solution, floor texture, chamber walls and shape. Animals were allowed to explore for 2 minutes before being re-exposed to the CS. Freezing was analyzed for 1–3 minutes. Freezing was measured using a FreezeScan video tracking system and software (Cleversys, Inc).

Spatial learning and memory was assessed using the radial arm water maze (RAWM) paradigm following the protocol described by Alamed et al. 39 . In this task the goal arm location containing a platform remains constant throughout the training and testing phase, while the start arm is changed during each trial. On day one during the training phase, mice are trained for 15 trails, with trials alternating between a visible and hidden platform. On day two during the testing phase, mice are tested for 15 trials with a hidden platform. Entry into an incorrect arm is scored as an error, and errors are averaged over training blocks (three consecutive trials). Investigators were blinded to genotype and treatment when scoring.

Mouse blood was collected into EDTA coated tubes via tail vein bleed, mandibular vein bleed, or intracardial bleed at time of sacrifice. EDTA plasma was generated by centrifugation at 1000g of freshly collected blood and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Human plasma and CSF samples were obtained from University of Washington School of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Northwest Network Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Oregon Health Science University and University of California San Diego. Subjects were chosen based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria as previously described 6 , 40 , 41 and outlined in Supplementary Table 1 . Informed consent was obtained from human subjects according to the institutional review board guidelines at the respective centers. The plasma concentrations of cytokines and signaling molecules were measured in human and mouse plasma samples using standard antibody-based multiplex immunoassays (Luminex) by Rules Based Medicine Inc., a fee-for-service provider. All Luminex measurements where obtained in a blinded fashion. All assays were developed and validated to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) guidelines based upon the principles of immunoassay as described by the manufacturers.

All experiments were randomized and blinded by an independent researcher prior to pharmacological treatment or assessment of genetic mouse models. Researchers remained blinded throughout histological, biochemical and behavioral assessments. Groups were un-blinded at the end of each experiment upon statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. The distribution of data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test or Shapiro-Wilk test. No significant differences in variance between groups were detected using an F test. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared with two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. Comparisons of means from multiple groups with each other or against one control group were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post-hoc tests (indicated in figure legends).
