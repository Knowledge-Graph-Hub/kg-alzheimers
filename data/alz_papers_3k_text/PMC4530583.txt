# Title
Conserved epigenomic signals in mice and humans reveal immune basis of Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe 1 age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized. Here, we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), while decreasing-level enhancer orthologs show fetal-brain-specific enhancer activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologs implicating immune processes in AD predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional studies of AD regulatory regions.

## Materials and Methods
All mouse work was approved by the Committee on Animal Care of the Division of Comparative Medicine at MIT. Adult (3-months-old) female double-transgenic CK-p25 (ref. 5 ) mice and their respective control littermates were used for the experiments. Brain tissue was collected at either 2 or 6 weeks following p25 induction. Upon dissection tissue was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. No animals were excluded from the study and no randomization or blinding was required.

Mouse hippocampus was harvested immediately after euthanasia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was then performed as described in Broad ChIP protocol ( http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/protocols/type/experimental/ ). Briefly, tissues were minced and crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min at room temperature and quenched with glycine for 5 min (Sigma). The samples were homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (complete, Roche) and chromatin was then fragmented to a size range of ~200–500 bp using a Branson 250 digital sonifier. Solubilized chromatin was then diluted and incubated with ~1 μg antibody at 4°C overnight. Immune complexes were captured with Protein A-sepharose beads, washed and eluted. Enriched chromatin was then subjected to crosslink reversal and proteinase K digestion at 65°C, phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Isolated ChIP DNA was resuspended and quantified using the Qubit assay (Invitrogen). H3K4me1 (Abcam, ab8895), H3K4me3 (Millipore, #07-473), H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898), H3K27me3 (Millipore, #07-449), H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729), H3K36me3 (Abcam, ab9050) and H4K20me1 (Abcam, ab9051) were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous proteins.

Sequencing libraries were prepared from ~1–5 ng ChIP (or input) DNA as described previously 31 . Gel electrophoresis was used to retain library fragments between 300 and 600 bp. Prior to sequencing, libraries were quantified using Qubit (Invitrogen) and quality-controlled using Agilent’s Bioanalyzer. 36 bp single end sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform according to standard operating procedures. For each histone modification, five biological replicate datasets were produced with corresponding whole cell extract controls, except for H3K4me3, H4K20me1and H3K27me3 in the 2 wk control (CK) sample where optimal amount of reads for sufficient coverage was obtained from four biological replicates. Reads were mapped to the mm9 reference mouse genome using MAQ v0.7.1-9 using default parameters 32 . Reads mapping to multiple locations were discarded. Duplicates were marked and filtered using PICARD ( http://picard.sourceforge.net/ ). After filtering, roughly 55–60 million unique reads were obtained for each histone modification in each condition (~9–12 million reads per replicate) and ~110–145 million reads in total for the whole-cell extract controls in each condition. All replicate datasets passed quality control based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data standards based on read quality, read mapping statistics, library complexity and strand cross-correlation analysis (to measure signal-to-noise ratios) 33 .

Mouse brains were homogenized and total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Ambion). Total RNA was quality-controlled using Agilent’s Bioanalyzer and prepared for sequencing using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit with Ribo-Zero. High-throughput sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Roughly 15 million 76 pair-end reads were generated for each dataset. Sequence reads were aligned to mouse mm9 genome with Bowtie. Based on the reproducibility of the results ( Fig. 2a ), three replicate biological datasets were produced for each condition. A small number of replicates suffice for RNA-seq studies 34 and we were able to detect large-scale changes in read counts in coherent Gene Ontology categories, with similarities to human AD ( Fig. 2c, d ). Therefore, we decided that additional replicates were not necessary.

For each histone modification in each condition, mapped reads were pooled across ChIP-seq replicates and regions of enrichment (peaks) were identified for the pooled ChIP-seq dataset relative to the pooled control using the MACS2 peak caller (version 2.0.10.20130712) 35 ( https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/ ) using a relaxed P value of 0.01. For each histone modification, overlapping peaks (at least 1 bp overlap) were merged across all conditions to obtain a non-redundant master list of regions of enrichment. Master lists of broad domains of enrichment for the diffused marks H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1 were obtained by allowing merging peaks across conditions that were within 1kb of each other. Genome-wide signal coverage tracks representing per-base fold enrichment and the likelihood ratio of ChIP relative to control were also computed using MACS2.

We used ChromHMM to learn combinatorial chromatin states jointly across all four conditions 36 . ChromHMM was trained using all seven chromatin marks in virtual concatenation mode across all conditions. Reads from replicate datasets were pooled before learning states. The ChromHMM parameters used are as follows: reads were shifted in the 5′ to 3′ direction by 100 bp; for each ChIP-seq dataset, read counts were computed in non-overlapping 200 bp bins across the entire genome; each bin was discretized into two levels, 1 indicating enrichment and 0 indicating no enrichment. The binarization was performed by comparing ChIP-seq read counts to corresponding whole-cell extract control read counts within each bin and using a Poisson P value threshold of 1 × 10 −4 (the default discretization threshold in ChromHMM). We trained several models with the number of states ranging from 12 states to 23 states. We decided to use a 14 state model for all further analyses since it captured all the key interactions between the chromatin marks and larger number of states did not capture significantly new interactions. To assign to assign biologically meaningful mnemonics to the states, we used the ChromHMM package to compute the overlap and neighborhood enrichments of each state relative to coordinates of known gene annotations. The trained model was then used to compute the posterior probability of each state for each genomic bin in each condition. The regions were labeled using the state with the maximum posterior probability. The chromatin state models and browser tracks can be downloaded from http://www.broadinstitute.org/~anshul/projects/liz/segmentation/results/S14/webpage_14.html

We used the DEseq2 method that models read count statistics from replicates across multiple conditions to identify differentially expressed genes and regions of enrichment of histone marks 37 . Our procedures are consistent with the standards for ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis determined by rigorous benchmarking as a part of the ENCODE project 33 . The minimal recommended depth for sufficient sensitivity of peak detection for histone marks for the human or mouse genome is ~20 million mapped reads 33 . However, due to limited amount of starting material obtained from a single mouse, we obtained ~10 million unique mapped reads from each biological replicate. Directly, using read counts from the original replicates would result in significant loss of power to detect differential events. To improve to improve sensitivity, for each histone mark in each condition, we pooled mapped reads from all replicates and created a pair of pseudo-replicates with equal number of reads (~30M) by randomly subsampling (without replacement) from the pool. Reads were then extended to the predominant fragment length. Extended-read counts were computed within all regions in the master peak list of a histone mark for all pseudo-replicates in all conditions and the table of counts was used as input to DEseq2. The raw data is available online (NCBI GEO GSE65159).

For RNA-seq data, the number of reads overlapping ENSEMBL gene models 38 were determined by HT-Seq ( http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/ ). The raw data is available online (NCBI GEO GSE65159). To ensure that the genes we chose were sufficiently quantifiable, we remove every gene where fewer than 20 reads were found across all samples. The resulting set of genes is found in Supplementary Table 1 .

IGV 39 is used to visualize the histone marks, gene expression, chromatin state, and AD GWAS data relative to the RefSeq gene model. Gene expression levels shown are raw read density. Levels of histone marks plotted are the log-likelihood ratio of ChIP signal relative to whole-cell extract control.

Within the DEseq2 framework of generalized linear models, we used a combination of different models to determine the significantly regulated genes and significantly regulated histone mark levels. We compared the set of all 2 week and 6 week controls to the three following groups: (1) the 2 week CK-p25 samples; (2) the 6 week CK-p25 samples; (3) a group containing both the 2 week and 6 week samples. The first two tests identified changes that might be 2-week or 6-week specific. The third test identified changes that might be too subtle to detect at any one time point alone. In each case, the most basic equation (count ~ CKp25 status) was used, but for a subset of samples. A stringent threshold of q < 0.01 (Benjamini Hochberg) was used to determine significantly changing genes expression levels and histone mark levels. Next, to determine the temporal bias of genes expression levels and histone marks we built another model (count ~ time), which compared the 2 week and 6 week CK-p25 samples. Levels considered likely to change (q<0.5) were categorizes as transient (2 week bias) or late-stage (6 week bias). The results of the RNA-seq analysis are found in Supplementary Table 1 , while the results of the histone mark analysis are in Supplementary Table 2 .

For the histone modifications, we defined promoters using H3K4me3 peaks labeled with the promoter state annotation under any of the conditions (CK-p25/control and 2 weeks/6 weeks). We define enhancers based on peaks of H3K27ac labeled by the enhancer chromatin state. We define Polycomb-repressed regions based on peaks H3K27me3 labeled by the Polycomb-repressed chromatin state. Our definitions are consistent with known roles of these histone modifications 40 . Defining the boundaries of the regulatory regions using the peaks of the relevant histone modifications, and not the chromatin states, maximizes our power to detect changes in histone mark levels.

Pathway and Gene Ontology analysis for the gene expression data were then generated through the use of DAVID 41 , 42 . We present the most significant biological process Gene Ontology category result as well as a subset of non-redundant less significant categories that still pass our threshold significant (q < 0.01). For the regulatory regions, GREAT (with default parameters) was used to find the fold enrichment in the same Gene Ontology categories 43 .

A common theme throughout the analysis is the characterization of regulatory regions that change in the CK-p25 mouse model. The most stringent control for this characterization are genes or regions of the same type that do not change in CK-p25. Due to the six categories of direction (increasing, decreasing) and temporal pattern (transient, consistent, late-stage), we chose a discrete statistical framework as opposed to trying to define a ranking across these different conditions. To measure the overlap between these discrete categories and other discrete data sets, we could use either a hypergeometric P value or a binomial P value. For every test in the material described below, we computed both significance values and obtained consistent results, with only minor differences in exact P value. In general, we chose the hypergeometric test, which is the most direct to look at overlap of annotated regions. As opposed to the overlap of the CK-p25 mouse categories with other ChIP-seq peaks, the overlap with transcription factor binding site motifs or SNPs can be thought of as sampling with replacement, which lends itself to the binomial P value.

As described above, DESeq2 was used determine the log fold change in expression at 2 and 6 weeks in CK-p25 mice relative to control. Each enhancer and promoter was mapped to the closest ENSEMBL gene model based on distance to transcription start. For each category of histone mark direction and temporal pattern, we examined the enrichment of each category of CK-p25 gene expression change relative to unchanging genes. The significance of the enrichment is calculated using a hypergeometric test.

The promoter (H3K4me3 peaks annotated as transcription start site by chromatin state), enhancer (H3K27ac peaks annotated as enhancer by chromatin state), and Polycomb-repressed regions (H3K27me3 peaks annotated as Polycomb-repressed by chromatin state) were mapped to the human genome. BED files representing the coordinates of these peaks in mm9 were mapped to mm10 using liftover 44 . Those peaks were mapped compared to the human genome the UCSC multiple alignment chain files ( http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/multiz60way/ ) 45 . More specifically, the alignments that overlap the mouse peak and include hg19 were extracted. We calculated the human mouse pairwise alignment for each multiple alignment using the “globalms” function of biopython ( http://biopython.org/ , version 1.59; python version 2.71). The highest scoring pairwise alignment formed base of the orthologous region in human. This region was extended on either side using lower scoring multiple alignments. The orthologous region in hg19 was required to be greater than 30 bp and no more than twice the length of the region in mouse. The mean conservation was examined using the PHASTCons score across placental mammals 46 based on the same 60-way multiple sequence alignment. The mapped enhancer regions were annotated with their chromatin state in human hippocampus, and across all 127 cell types and tissues, using BEDTools 47 . The information from human tissues was collected according to protocols described in more detail in the companion publication as a part of the Roadmap Epigenomics project 10 ( http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/ ). The protocols are approved by the NIH and no sequence information from identifiable subjects is provided.

To computationally estimate the relative composition of the neural and immune cell types we compared the changing expression patterns in our dataset to a set of established cell-type specific markers 48 – 50 . This analysis shows that indeed it is likely that cell type composition is changing in the CK-p25 mouse model, consistent with a known decrease in number of neurons and astrogliosis at six weeks 5 . In summary, a transient enrichment of monocyte specific transcripts was observed at 2 weeks, a consistent enrichment of microglial-specific transcripts was enriched at 2 weeks and 6 weeks, while astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and endothelial-specific markers were primarily increased at 6 weeks ( Extended Data Fig. 9a, b ). We could also detect a signature of neuronal loss, primarily at 6 weeks as well ( Extended Data Fig. 9a, b ). Based on these results alone, it is possible that changes in cell type composition are contributing to some of the differences we observe in our mouse model.

We also compared our data to a published study of microglial activation in another mouse model of AD 8 , to computationally dissect out changes likely due to cell type proportion versus changes due to activation within cells. If the changes in our mouse model were primarily due to cell type proportion, then the increase we observed in the CK-p25 mice should be proportional to the expression level of those genes microglia. If the changes we observed were primarily due to activation, then the changes we observe in the CK-p25 mouse should be proportional to the amount of activation found in during neurodegeneration 8 . Using the genes with published gene expression changes during activation 8 , we modeled these two possibilities as a linear regression problem and examined the relative significance of both hypotheses in the R programming language:

CK-p25 log fold change ~ Microlglial Expression + Microglial Activation log fold change

We found that the changes in the CK-p25 mice were significantly related to the changes in cell activation ( P = 2.9 × 10 −6 ) as well as the changes in cell type proportion ( P = 2.7 × 10 −4 ), suggesting that both cell activation and composition changes occur.

To examine the relationship between AD in the mouse model and human, we mapped each 1-1 orthologous gene from mouse to human in ENSEMBL ( http://www.biomart.org/ ) 51 . For each category of expression change in mouse, we examined how that set of genes behaved in human AD cases relative to controls in whole hippocampus 52 as well as laser capture microdissected hippocampal grey matter 2 . To make this comparison we first downloaded both datasets from GEO (GSE1297, GSE28146), applied a variance stabilization normalization, and then used limma 53 to find the log fold change in expression of all cases relative to controls. For each category of mouse gene expression, we calculated a P value based on a t-test for the bias of genes to increase or decrease in human AD relative to control. Because the original study 52 had more confounders due to changes in grey/white matter proportion, we focused our analysis on the 22 cases and 9 controls from the laser capture samples 2 .

Peaks representing both neural 15 , 16 and immune 17 – 19 enhancers or transcription factor binding were used to annotate the H3K27ac enhancers and H3K4me3 promoters. We used a hypergeometric test to evaluate whether or not these external annotations were enriched in the set of increased-level or decreased-level enhancers relative to the enhancers whose levels do not change. This same procedure was used to look at the enrichment of the CK-p25 enhancer orthologs in Roadmap Epigenome data. In this case, only enhancers that map to human are taken to be the background.

The putative binding sites based on transcription factor binding site motifs were identified independent of conservation and have been previously published 54 . The transcription factor binding sites were further clustered based on similarity 55 . The least significant of two statistical test was used as a stringent measure of binding site enrichment. (1) The real transcription factor binding site motifs in the category of interest were compared to shuffled control motifs that preserved nucleotide content. (2) The real transcription factor binding site motifs in the category of interest were compared to the real motifs in enhancers that are stable in the CK-p25 mice. To estimate the significance for test (1), we use a binomial P value because the length distribution is different for changing regulator regions compared to unchanging. Then we estimate the probability of finding a site per base pair. To estimate the significance for test (2), we use hypergeometric test. After identifying significant transcription factor binding sites in categories or regulatory regions, we collapsed the results into clusters of almost identical motifs, representing families. The group members can be found in a companion manuscript 10 as well as online ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/~pouyak/motifs-table/ ).

14 oligonucleotide gBlocks (IDT), ranging in 500–1000 nt in length, and corresponding to 10 enhancer regions were synthesized. Each gBlock contained a constant 5′ GCTAGCCTCGAGGAT and 3′ ATCAAGATCTGGCCT region, for direct cloning into an EcoRV (NEB) linearized minimal promoter firefly luciferase vector pGL4.23[luc2/minP] (Promega). The resulting reporter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. BV-2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Yankner. N2a cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained following their protocols. Briefly, cells were grown in RPMI-1640 and DMEM respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen/strep, and split 1:10 every 3 days. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Transfections into BV-2 and N2a cells were performed with 1 μg of a pGL4.23 plasmid and 200 ng of Renilla luciferase construct pGL4.74[Rluc/TK] (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured 24 h post-transfection using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) and an EnVision 2103 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate.

2 week induced CK-p25 mice and age-matched controls were perfused with 50 mls PBS to wash away blood and minimize macrophage contamination in the brains. Hippocampal tissue was harvested immediately after perfusion and a single-cell suspension was prepared as described previously 56 . Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was then used to purify CD11b + CD45 low microglia cells using APC conjugated CD11b mouse clone M1/70.15.11.5 (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-098-088) and PE conjugated CD45 antibody (BD Pharmingen, #553081). Cells were collected directly into RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen, #74104).

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, #74104) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity was determined using Agilent’s Bioanalyzer and reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad, #170-8891). For gene expression analysis cDNA from three biological replicates was quantitatively amplified on a thermal cycler (BioRad) using SYBR green (Biorad) and gene-specific primers ( Supplementary Table 8 ). The comparative Ct method 57 was used to examine differences in gene expression. Values were normalized to expression levels of Cd11b (also known as Itgam ). Three technical replicates were used for each gene.

The human orthologous regions to mouse enhancers that change in the CK-p25 mouse were compared to control for the their enrichment to overlap regulatory SNPs from published eQTL studies in immune cell types under a variety of conditions 25 , 26 . Because the eQTLs were processed separately, we applied our own threshold ( P < 1 × 10 −4 ). We then calculated enrichment of human orthologs of different categories CK-p25 enhancers relative to stable regions and used a binomial P value to estimate the significance.

The enrichment of AD GWAS SNPs that map to Roadmap enhancer regions is calculated based on permutations of SNPs. Briefly, SNPs were permuted 1,000,000 times preserving distance to gene, minor allele frequency, and a number of SNPs in LD. The thousand genomes projects database was used as the reference for this information.

The enrichment of CK-p25 human enhancer orthologs in AD was calculated by comparing the number changing regions that overlap SNPs 4 to unchanging regions that overlap SNPs. We calculate the significance using a binomial P value, where the probability of success in the changing enhancers is based on the frequency in the unchanging enhancers. The results for the consistently increasing enhancers were slightly more significant when using a hypergeometric test instead of the binomial. To test whether the enrichment of increasing enhancer orthologous regions was due to the overlap with CD14 + cell enhancers, we repeated the above enrichment procedure within the set of CK-p25 enhancer orthologs that also overlap CD14 + cell enhancers. The enrichment using this control was still significant (3.0-fold enrichment, binomial P = 1.3 × 10 −5 ). AD GWAS SNPs that were in a mouse enhancer orthologs were expanded using an LD of 0.8 and then tested for potential coding SNPs 58 or eQTLs ( Supplementary Table 7 ).
