Modifiers ofC9orf72DPR toxicity implicate nucleocytoplasmic transport impairments in c9FTD/ALS

# Abstract
C9orf72 mutations are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) produced by unconventional translation of the C9orf72 repeat expansions cause neurodegeneration in cell culture and in animal models. We performed two unbiased screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified potent modifiers of DPR toxicity, uncovering karyopherins and effectors of Ran-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport, providing insight into potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

## Online Methods
Yeast cells were grown in rich media (YPD) or in synthetic media lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose (SD-Ura), raffinose (SRaf-Ura), or galactose (SGal-Ura). To generate C9orf72 dipeptide expression constructs (PR) 50 , (PA) 50 , (GA) 50 and (GR) 50 we utilized codon-optimized DPR sequences using Mfold software to minimize the formation of stable RNA secondary structures. ATG-DPR-FLAG constructs were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, USA) and were flanked by attB sites. Constructs were further subcloned into a pDONR221 plasmid and subsequently used in Gateway LR reactions with pAG416GAL-ccdB or pAG303GAL-ccdB to produce yeast expression vectors. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pAG416GAL-DPR constructs were transformed into Y7092 strain. pAG303GAL-DPR constructs were transformed into W303 strain. Strains were manipulated and media prepared using standard techniques.

Yeast procedures were performed according to standard protocols. We used the PEG/lithium acetate method to transform yeast with plasmid DNA. For spotting assays, yeast cells were grown overnight at 30°C in liquid media containing SRaf-Ura until they reached log or mid-long phase. Cultures were then normalized for OD 600 , serially diluted and spotted with a Frogger (V&P Scientific) onto synthetic solid media containing glucose (SD-Ura) or galactose (SGal-Ura) lacking uracil and were grown at 30°C for 2–3 days.

The yeast FLEXGene collection was used to perform the genome-wide plasmid overexpression screen 21 . Plasmid DNA from the expression clones were isolated using the Plasmid Plus 96 miniprep kit (Qiagen). DNA was dried in individual wells of 96-well microtiter plates and transformed into a strain expressing (PR) 50 integrated at the HIS3 locus. A standard lithium acetate transformation protocol was modified for automation and used by employing a BIOROBOT Rapidplate 96-well pipettor (Qiagen). The transformants were grown in synthetic deficient media lacking uracil (SD-Ura) with glucose overnight. The overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh SD-Ura media with raffinose and allowed to reach stationary phase. The cells were spotted on to SD-Ura + glucose and SD-Ura + galactose agar plates. Suppressors of (PR) 50 induced toxicity were identified on galactose plates after 2–3 days of growth at 30°C. We repeated the screen two independent times and candidate modifier genes were retested at least three times to confirm their authenticity. To exclude false-positive enhancer genes caused by a general inhibition of growth unrelated to (PR) 50 expression, these genes were transformed into wild type yeast cells and their effect on growth determined.

We used synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis to identify nonessential yeast deletions that modify C9orf72 dipeptide toxicity. We performed this screen essentially as described in 22 , with some modifications using a Singer RoToR HAD (Singer Instruments). We mated MATα strain expressing (PR) 50 dipeptide under galactose promoter to the yeast haploid deletion collection of nonessential genes (MATa, each gene deleted with KanMX cassette conferring resistance to G418). Following diploid selection and sporulation, we selected haploids carrying both deletion and (PR) 50 expression cassette. Colony sizes were measured using the ht-colony-measurer software 23 . The raw values were normalized by dividing them by the median colony size of the plate. We performed the entire screen two independent times and confirmed each of the candidate modifier genes at least two times to confirm their authenticity.

We tested effects of the deletions on (PR) 50 expression levels. Some modifiers lowered levels of (PR) 50 (e.g., dhh1 Δ, gtr1 Δ, sgo1 Δ, ski8 Δ, stp1 Δ and uaf30 Δ) ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). Deletion of these 6 genes did not have any effect on levels of YFP expressed under the same promoter ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ) and 5 out of 6 of them had no effect on toxicity of α–syn or TDP-43 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 a,b and data not shown). One (PR) 50 toxicity suppressor, ski8 Δ, also suppressed TDP-43 toxicity ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ) but had no effect on α–syn toxicity ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). These modifiers represent an interesting class, which might regulate expression levels or stability of this DPR specifically. Regulating levels of toxic neurodegenerative disease proteins is emerging as an important way to combat their toxicity. Finally, one modifier, ubr2 Δ, suppressed toxicity of all three toxic proteins ((PR) 50 , TDP-43, and α–syn). This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, perhaps pointing to a common way to mitigate toxicity from diverse aggregation-prone disease proteins.

For immunocytochemistry yeast was induced in 2% galactose for 5 hours and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 1ml of solution A (0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.2 M sorbitol, 40 mM K 3 PO 4 , pH 6.5). To generate spheroplasts we added 10 µl of β-mercaptoethanol and 25 µl if 10 mg/ml lyticase for 15 min at 37°C. Spheroplasted cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 1 ml of PBS, once with 1 ml of solution A and resuspeded in 250 µl of PBS+BSA (1× PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA). 150 µl of cell suspension was incubated on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher) for 5 min and blocked with 50 µl of PBS+BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:100, Sigma #F1804), washed 3 times with PBS, incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:800, Invitrogen #21203) and washed 3 times with PBS. Samples were mounted using ProLong Gold with DAPI (Life Technologies).

Functional enrichment analysis was performed with the Functional Annotation Chart tool of DAVID v. 6.7 24 using the S. cerevisiae genome as background 24 .

All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and regulations. E17 mouse cortical neurons were isolated using Papain Dissociation System (Worthington Biochemicals, #LK003150), plated on poly-L-lysine coated plates and grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen) and glutamine. At DIV4 neurons were transduced with lentiviruses encoding GFP, (PR) 50 or KPNA3, under conditions that conferred transduction efficiency of 95%. 5 days post-infection neuronal survival was assessed by NeuN (1:1000, Millipore #MAB377) counting. Experiment assessing the effects of KPNA3 upregulation on (PR) 50 toxicity in mouse neurons was repeated three independent times. In each experiment, neuronal survival was assessed in minimum 6 separate wells for each condition. All images were obtained and neuronal numbers assessed in a blinded fashion.

Primary human dermal fibroblasts from 3 healthy control patients and 2 C9orf72 -ALS patients were obtained from Coriell Institute 25 and the University Hospital Erlangen. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium containing 15% FBS and 0.1% NEAA (all Gibco). Direct Ngn2 and Ascl1-based conversion was performed similar to previously described 18 , 26 . Briefly, the cells were lentivirally transduced with pLVX-EtO and pLVXTP-N2A and further passaged in the presence of G418 (200 µg/ml Gibco) and puromycin (1 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in tetracycline-free FBS-containing media. To generate induced neurons the media was changed to induced neuron conversion media for 3 weeks and changed every 3 days. Induced neuron conversion media is based on DMEM:F12/Neurobasal (1:1 v/v) and contains the following supplements: N2 supplement and B27 supplement (both 1×; Gibco), doxycycline (2 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), Laminin (1 µg/ml, life technologies), dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (500 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), human recombinant noggin (150 ng/ml; Preprotech), LDN-193189 (0.5 µM; Cayman Chemical Co) and A83-1 (0.5 µM; Stemgent), CHIR99021 (3 µM, LC Laboratories), Forskolin (5 µM, LC Laboratories) and SB-431542 (10 µM; Cayman Chemical Co). For maturation, iN cells were gently transferred on top of a monolayer culture of mouse astrocytes 27 and further cultured for one weeks (4 weeks total) in induced neuron maturation media containing the supplements GDNF, BDNF (both 20 ng/ml, R&D), dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (500 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), doxycycline (2 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin (1 µg/ml, life technologies) and subsequently fixed with 4% PFA. iNeurons were labelled with anti-RCC1 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-1161), anti-TUJ1 (1:3000, Millipore), anti-lamin B (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-6217), RanGAP1 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-25630), anti-exportin 5 (1:100, Bethyl Laboratories, A303-991A), anti-TNPO3 (1:100, Abcam, #ab54353), anti-KPNA3 (1:100, Everest Biotech, #EB06237). All images were obtained and analyzed in a blinded fashion.
