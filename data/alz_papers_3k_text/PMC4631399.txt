GGGGCC repeat expansion inC9ORF72compromises nucleocytoplasmic transport

# Abstract
GGGGCC (G 4 C 2 ) repeat expansion in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 is the most common cause of sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 1 , 2 . The basis for pathogenesis is unknown. To capture the consequences of G 4 C 2 repeat expansion in a tractable genetic system, we generated transgenic fly lines expressing 8, 28 or 58 G 4 C 2 repeat-containing transcripts that do not have a translation start site (AUG) but contain an open-reading frame for green fluorescent protein (GFP) to detect repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. These transgenic animals show dosage-dependent, repeat length-dependent degeneration in neuronal tissues and RAN translation of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins as observed in patients. This model was used in a large-scale, unbiased genetic screen ultimately leading to the identification of 18 genetic modifiers that encode components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as well as the machinery that coordinates the export of nuclear RNA and the import of nuclear proteins. Consistent with these results we found morphological abnormalities in the architecture of the nuclear envelope in cells expressing expanded G 4 C 2 repeats in vitro and in vivo . Moreover, we identified a substantial defect in RNA export resulting in retention of RNA in the nuclei of Drosophila cells expressing expanded G 4 C 2 repeats and also in mammalian cells, including aged iPSC-derived neurons from C9ORF72 patients. These studies show that a primary consequence of G 4 C 2 repeat expansion is the compromise of nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore, revealing a novel mechanism of neurodegeneration.

## Methods
To generate transgenic Drosophila expressing G 4 C 2 -8, G 4 C 2 -28 and G 4 C 2 -58, G 4 C 2 repeats of the respective length were cloned downstream of the UAS promoter and upstream of the EGFP sequence with the start codon removed in the plasmid pUAST-ATTB. Transgenic Drosophila lines were generated by BestGene Inc. such that the transgene was inserted using the PhiC31 integrase into either the attP2 site on chromosome 3 (loci 68A4) or the attP40 site on chromosome 2 (loci 25C6). GFP-(GP) 47 , GFP-(GA) 50 , and GFP-(GR) 50 plasmids 30 were subcloned into the pUAST-ATTB plasmid and inserted into the attP2 site by BestGene Inc. Flies were raised at 25°C on a standard diet. A complete listing of Drosophila stocks that modify the G 4 C 2 -58 phenotype are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . For genetic interaction studies, the combined stock ( GMR-GAL4/Cyo; UAS-G 4 C 2 -58/Tm6,Tb ) was crossed with deficiency stocks or individual mutants and phenotypic analysis was performed on flies aged 24–48 hours in both males and females. Knock down efficiency of RNAi lines was measured by quantitative RT-PCR ( Extended Data Fig. 10 , Supplementary Table 6 ). For nuclear envelope morphology studies, the recombined stocks ( Fkh-GAL4, UAS-GFP/TM6,Tb; Fkh-GAL4 , UAS-G 4 C 2 -8/TM6,Tb ; and Fkh-GAL4,UAS-G 4 C 2 -58/TM6,Tb ) were crossed with UAS-mRFP-Nup107 transgenic flies or immunostained for endogenous Lamin C.

Deficiency stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center deficiency kit. RNAi lines were obtained from either the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center or the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. UAS-RAN T24N and Fkh-Gal4 flies were kindly provided by Drs. K. S. McKim and E. Baehrecke respectively.

Phenotypic analysis of G 4 C 2 repeat expression in the Drosophila eye, muscle, and salivary gland was assessed by crossing G 4 C 2 -8, G 4 C 2 -28 and G 4 C 2 -58 lines to GMR-GAL4, MHC-GAL4 , and FKH-GAL4 , respectively. Neuronal expression was achieved by crossing G 4 C 2 -8, G 4 C 2 -28 and G 4 C 2 -58 lines to elav-GAL4 (pan neuronal driver) or OK371-GAL4 (motor neuron driver). Eye phenotypes were imaged by light microscopy and muscle phenotypes were visually assessed by wing posture (n=30 controls, 21 G 4 C 2 -8, 50 G 4 C 2 -28 and 24 G 4 C 2 -58). Neuromuscular synaptic bouton number, active zone density and crawling ability were measured as previously described 31 , 32 with slight modification. To count type 1b synaptic bouton number, each genotype was double stained presynaptically with anti-HRP-Cy3 (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch) and postsynaptically with anti-Disc large 1 (1:50, DSHB). Synaptic boutons of muscle 4 in abdominal segment 2, 3 and 4 (A2–A4) were imaged with a Marianas spinning disc microscope and maximum projection images were used to count synaptic boutons. Active zone area and presynaptic area stained by anti-Bruchpilot (NC82, 1:100, DSHB) and anti-HRP-Cy3 were measured with ImageJ and the ratio of active zone area/presynaptic area was calculated. Muscle 4 in abdominal segment 2, 3 and 4 (A2–A4) was analyzed. To examine crawling ability, 4–7 wandering 3 rd instar larvae for each group were collected, washed and placed onto a 3% agarose gel in a 10 cm dish. After 5 min acclimation, larval crawling behavior was recorded by a digital camera for 30 sec (15 fps). Each group was tested three times. Moving distances of each larva were manually measured with ImageJ.

Dissected salivary glands from wandering third instar larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 15 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBT, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum (Sigma) diluted in PBT. Tissues were then incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-Lamin C (1:30, LC28.26; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)). After three washes in PBT (10 min each), Tissues were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568, 1:200; Invitrogen) diluted in the blocking solution. Tissues were washed three times in PBS and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence signals were examined with an Olympus IX70 Microscope or Leica TCS SP5 II laser scanning confocal microscope.

To visualize poly(GP)-GFP in the thorax expressing G 4 C 2 -58, flies were cleared overnight using a modified ScaleA2 (2 M urea, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton-X). RAN peptides were visualized using light sheet microscopy. To visualize RAN products at high magnification, thoraxes were dissected and stained with the same immunofluorescence protocol described above for salivary glands but using anti-Lamin (1:100, ADL 67.10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)) to visualize the nucleus and phalloidin (1:40, Life Technologies) to visualize the muscle structure.

Adult flies were frozen with dry ice and vortexed to remove the heads or thorax. Samples from each genotype were homogenized in RIPA buffer with proteinase inhibitor cocktail added. Urea buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mM Tris pH8.5) was used when indicated to visualize the non-RIPA soluble protein fraction. Sample was mixed with 4X sample buffer (1 M Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min, separated on a SDS gel and transferred to a membrane. The membrane was blocked, probed with primary antibody, and incubated with secondary antibody. The signal was visualized with either chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce) or by using an Odyssey Fc (Li-Cor). Primary western blot antibodies were anti-GFP (AB3080, Millipore or SC-9996 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-poly(GP), poly(GA) or poly(GR) antibodies 33 , 34 , anti-β-actin antibody (4967; Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-actin antibody (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Fixation of dissected salivary glands, cortical neurons, HeLa, or 293T cells (obtained from ATCC) was performed using 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 5 min, followed by a second fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% NP40 for an additional 5 min. Samples were then transferred to 70% ethanol and stored at −20°C until needed. The probes for global RNA in either Drosophila or human cells were prepared from genomic DNA derived from w 1118 flies or 293T cells. Both probes were labeled by nick translation using either alexafluor 594 dUTP. To hybridize the probes, 70 ng of the labeled probes (the human probe was combined with 2 μg of human cot1 DNA) were suspended in 10 μl of hybridization buffer consisting of 50% formamide, 2X SSC, and 10% dextran sulfate. Fixed cells were dehydrated in 70%, 80%, and 100% ethanol for 2 min each prior to hybridization. Probes suspended in hybridization buffer were denatured at 70°C for 5 min and then applied to the dehydrated cells and hybridized at 37°C overnight. Samples were washed following hybridization in 50% formamide, 2X SSC at 37°C for 5 min, then briefly rinsed in room temperature PBS and mounted on slides with DAPI. To detect poly(A) mRNA, HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by ice cold methanol and 70% ethanol for 10min each. The cells were treated with 1 ng/ l μL of 5′-labeled Cy3-oligo-dT(20) at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were washed in room temperature PBS and mounted on slides with DAPI. Images were captured using either widefield fluorescence microscopy or a Marianas spinning disc microscope. An extended depth of focus function was used to combine all components of individual microscope fields.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP, G 4 C 2 -8 or G 4 C 2 -58 that had been subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 using Fugene HD (Promega). After 48 h incubation, cells were treated with to 1 mM 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) was for 1 h. RNA was then visualized at indicated time points using the Click-iT detection kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. To visualize GFP signal, cells were co-stained using monoclonal anti-GFP (SC-9996, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a primary antibody.

iPSC lines from 2 control subjects and 4 G 4 C 2 repeat expansion carriers have been previously characterized 23 – 25 , 35 (please see Extended Data Table 4). Generation of integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of one G 4 C 2 expansion carrier and one control subject, using episomal plasmids with the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Lin28 and L-Myc were performed as described before 36 , which was approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Biosafety Committee. The use of human fibroblasts was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. After reprogramming, characterization of iPSCs shows that cells have normal karyotype, express pluripotent markers and have the capacity to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers as described in Almeida et al., (2012, 2013) 23 , 35 . All the iPSC lines used here were tested regularly with no mycoplasma contamination.

4 iPSC lines from 3 control subjects and 6 iPSC lines from 5 C9ORF72 carriers were differentiated to cortical neurons as described earlier 23 , 35 (please also see Extended Data Table 5). Neuronal cultures were aged for 8-weeks before fixation for RNA FISH.

For immunostaining cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and then permeabilized with 0.3 % Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 minutes; cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-OCT4 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-NANOG 1:100 (R&D Systems), mouse anti-SSEA4 1:100 (Abcam), rabbit anti-desmin 1:100 (Thermo Scientific), mouse anti-βIII-tubulin 1:500 (Promega), mouse anti-α-fetoprotein 1:200 (R&D Systems), mouse anti-MAP2 1:500 (Sigma), goat anti ChAT 1:200 (EMD Millipore), rabbit anti-VGLUT1 1:500 (Synaptic Systems). After incubation with primary antibodies cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies 1:500 (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature followed by counter staining with DAPI.

FISH in iPSCs derived from control and C9ORF72 expansion carrier using a Cy3-conjugated (GGCCCC) 4 probe was performed as described in Almeida et al., (2013) 23 .

For salivary glands, 30 cells from at least 5 individual salivary glands for each genotype were used for quantitative analysis. ImageJ software was used to measure the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic RNA by comparing the total RNA measured in the nucleus to that of the cytoplasm. DAPI was used to mark the nucleus. For cortical neurons, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic RNA density was calculated by measuring the density of the RNA signal in both the nucleus and cell body using ImageJ software. DAPI was used to mark the nuclear boundary of neurons. For cortical neurons, at least 15 neurons were measured from each individual patient (Controls 1–3 (n=16, 16, 31) and Patients 1–5 (n=16,16,16,30,15)). Error bars for all quantification are standard error.

This phenotype was assessed by examining the permanent wing posture of live adult flies.

a , Western blot revealing translation of RAN poly-dipeptides in flies expressing G 4 C 2 -58 in the eye. RAN poly-dipeptides were not found in flies expressing G 4 C 2 -8 or control flies. There was minimal expression of GFP positive product observed in flies expressing G 4 C 2 -28. GFP expressing flies (lane 1) were used as a positive control for the anti-GFP antibody. b , Western blot showing production of RAN product when G 4 C 2 -28 and G 4 C 2 -58 but not G 4 C 2 -8 repeats are expressed in the muscle.

Scale bars: 25 μm. g , Expression of G 4 C 2 -58 in pan neuronal cells by elav driver results in the nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. Scale bar: 25 μm.

a , Transgenic Drosophila were generated that express ATG driven poly(GA), poly(GR) and poly(GP) peptides with an N-terminal GFP tag (top). Expression of GFP-(GA)50 and GFP-(GP)47 were nontoxic when expressed in the eye with GMR-GAL4 whereas GFP-(GR)50 expression resulted in >95% lethality with surviving adults having severely degenerated eyes (bottom). b , Western blot showing the expression of G 4 C 2 -58, GFP-(GA)50, GFP-(GR)50 and GFP-(GP)47 as visualized in muscle by anti-GFP antibody. c , Western blot showing the expression of poly(GP) in muscle of flies expressing G 4 C 2 -58 and GFP-(GP)47 but not GFP-(GA)50, GFP-(GR)50 and control flies as visualized by anti-GP antibody. d , Dot blot analysis of RAN peptides in muscle revealing expression of poly(GA) only in GFP-(GA)50 flies, expression of poly(GR) in G 4 C 2 -58 and GFP-(GR)50 flies. As expected, anti-sense DPR poly(PR) was not found in any of the lysates. The background protein signal was used as a loading control.

a , A threonine to asparagine substitution at residue 24 in the Ran protein abolishes the affinity for GTP and reduces its affinity for GDP. Hence, the Ran (T24N) is always in either a nucleotide free state or in its inactive, GDP-bound state, and acts as dominant negative. RANT24N expression driven by GMR-GAL4 causes a mild eye phenotype when expressed in the absence of G 4 C 2 -58 (upper row, right panel). The G 4 C 2 -58 rough eye phenotype is strongly enhanced by dominant negative RANT24N expression (middle row, left panel). The G 4 C 2 -58 eye phenotype is significantly enhanced by knockdown of Nup153 by two independent RNAi lines (middle row, two right panels). The G 4 C 2 -58 eye phenotype is also mildly enhanced by knockdown of transportin (Trn) (bottom row). b , Knockdown of Crm1 in flies expressing G 4 C 2 -58 induces a mild enhancement of the G 4 C 2 -58 eye phenotype (left vs. middle). Crm1 knockdown in the absence of G 4 C 2 -58 repeats does not produce a rough eye phenotype (left). c , Expression of two copies of G 4 C 2 -58 in the Drosophila motor neurons leads to reduced viability (50%). Chemical inhibition of Crm1 with Leptomycin B (500 nM) enhances G 4 C 2 -58 toxicity resulting in reduced viability (23%). Leptomycin B does not impede viability (100%) in Drosophila expressing GFP.
