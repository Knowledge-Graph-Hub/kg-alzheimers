# Title
Impermanence of dendritic spines in live adult CA1 hippocampus

# Abstract
Mammalian hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory formation 1 and transiently retains information for ~3–4 weeks in adult mice and longer in humans 2 . Although neuroscientists widely believe neural synapses are elemental sites of information storage 3 , there has been no direct evidence hippocampal synapses persist for time intervals commensurate with the duration of hippocampal-dependent memory. Here we tested the prediction that the lifetimes of hippocampal synapses match the longevity of hippocampal memory. By using time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy 4 in the CA1 hippocampal area of live mice, we monitored the turnover dynamics of pyramidal neurons’ basal dendritic spines, post-synaptic structures whose turnover dynamics are thought to reflect those of excitatory synaptic connections 5 , 6 . Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed sharply from that seen previously in neocortex 7 – 9 . Mathematical modeling revealed that the data best matched kinetic models with a single population of spines of mean lifetime ~1–2 weeks. This implies ~100% turnover in ~2–3 times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic connectivity pattern. Although NMDA receptor blockade stabilizes spines in neocortex 10 , 11 , in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of spine loss and thus lowered spine density. These results reveal that adult neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have divergent patterns of spine regulation and quantitatively support the idea that the transience of hippocampal-dependent memory directly reflects the turnover dynamics of hippocampal synapses.

## Methods
Stanford APLAC approved all procedures. We imaged neurons in mice expressing green fluorescent protein driven by the Thy1 -promoter 31 (heterozygous males 10–12 weeks old, GFP-M lines on a C57Bl6 × F1 background). We did not perform any randomization in animal’s groups. We performed surgeries as previously published 4 but with a few modifications. We anesthetized mice using isoflurane (1.5–3% in O 2 ) and implanted a stainless steel screw into the cranium above the brain’s right hemisphere. We performed a craniotomy in the left hemisphere (2.0 ± 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, 2.0 ± 0.3 mm lateral to midline) using a 1.8-mm-diameter trephine and implanted the optical guide tube with its window just dorsal to, but not within, area CA1, preserving the alveus.

Guide tubes were glass capillaries (1.5-mm-ID, 1.8-mm-OD or 2-mm-ID, 2.4-mm-OD; 2–3 mm in length). We attached a circular cover slip, matched in diameter to that of the capillary’s outer edge, to one end of the guide tube, by using optical epoxy (Norland Optical Adhesive 81). We used 1.0-mm-diameter micro-optical probes of diffraction-limited resolution (0.8 NA, 250 μm working distance in water) that were encased in a 1.4-mm-diameter sheath 14 .

We used a modified commercial two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies) equipped with a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon, Coherent). We tuned the laser emission to 920 nm and adjusted the average illumination power at the sample (~5–25 mW) for consistency in signal strength across imaging sessions in each mouse. For microendoscopy we used a 20× 0.8 NA objective (Zeiss, Plan-Apochromat) to deliver illumination into the microlenses. In some cases we imaged directly through the glass cannula using a Olympus LUMPlan Fl/IR 0.8 NA 40× water immersion objective lens and confirmed that the optical resolution in all three spatial axes was identical between the two approaches. Beginning at 15–18 days post-surgery, we imaged mice every three days under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% in O 2 ) for a total of 8–16 sessions each lasting 60–90 min. We imaged some mice at irregular intervals up to 80 days.

In mice subject to the protocol of Fig. 2d , after the fourth imaging session we administered MK801 (Tocris Bioscence; 0.25 mg · g −1 body weight; dissolved in saline) in two intraperitoneal injections each day (8–10 h apart) as in prior work 10 .

Animals given an enriched environment had a larger cage [42(l) × 21.5(w) × 21.5(h) cm 3 ] that contained a running wheel, objects of various colors, textures and shapes, plastic tunnels, and food with different flavors. We changed the objects, as well as their placements within the cage, every 3–4 days to encourage exploration and maintain novelty. We provided food and water ad libitum .

At the end of in vivo experimentation, we deeply anesthetized mice with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg). We then perfused phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) into the heart, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. We fixed brains overnight at 4°C and prepared floating sections (50 mm) on a vibrating microtome (VT1000S, Leica). Prior to in vitro imaging of GFP fluorescence, we washed the fluorescent sections with PBS buffer several times and quenched them by incubation in 150mM Glycine in PBS for 15 min. After three washes in PBS, we mounted sections with Fluoromout-G (Southern Biotech). We inspected the sections using either two-photon fluorescence imaging or a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope (Leica TCS STED CW, equipped with a Leica HCX PL APO 100× 1.40 NA oil-immersion objective.).

For immunostaining sections were washed with PBS buffer several times before quenching and permeabilization (15 minutes incubation in 01% triton-X in PBS). Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1% Triton X-100, 2% BSA, 2% goat serum in PBS) for 4 hours. Primary antibodies (rat anti CD68, FA11-ab5344, Abcam, 1:100 dilution; mouse anti GFAP, MAB3402, Millipore, 1:500 dilution;) were diluted in blocking solution and sections were incubated overnight in this solution. The following day sections were washed with PBS and incubated in diluted secondary antibody (Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, A10524 and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, A10525; both Molecular Probes; both 1:1000 dilution) in blocking solution for 3 hours. All staining procedures were done at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, sections were mounted with Fluoromout-G (Southern Biotech). Histological specimens were inspected on a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica SP2 AOBS).

We mounted the isoflurane-anesthetized mice on a stereotactic frame. To perform microendoscopy we fully inserted the microendoscope probe into the guide tube such that the probe rested on the guide tube’s glass window. To attain precise and reliable three-dimensional alignments across all imaging sessions of the brain tissue undergoing imaging, we used a laser-based alignment method. We positioned a laser beam such that when the mouse’s head was properly aligned, the beam reflected off the back surface of the microendoscope and hit a designated target. This ensured that at each imaging session the long axis of the microendoscope was perpendicular to the optical table to within ~1 angular degree. Otherwise we inserted a drop of water in the cannula and imaged using the water immersion objective. As previously 14 , we experimentally confirmed that the resolution limits of the two approaches were essentially identical.

During the first imaging session, we selected several regions of brain tissue for longitudinal monitoring across the duration of the time-lapse experiment. Each of these regions contained between one and seven dendritic segments visibly expressing GFP. In each imaging session, we acquired 6–8 image stacks of each selected regions using a voxel size of 0.0725 × 0.0725 × 0.628 μm 3 .

To improve the visual saliency of fine details within each image stack, initial pre-processing of the image stacks involved a blind deconvolution based on an expectation-maximization routine (Autodeblur from Autoquant). We then aligned all individual images acquired at the same depth in tissue using the TurboReg plug-in routine for ImageJ. Finally, we averaged pixel intensities across the aligned stacks, yielding a single stack that we used in subsequent analyses.

We scored spines using a custom MATLAB interface that supported manual labeling of spines using the computer mouse, measurements of dendrite length and spine position, and alignments of time-lapse sets of image stacks. For each region of tissue monitored, we loaded all the image stacks acquired across time, such that the temporal sequence of the stacks was preserved but the experimenter was blind to their dates of image acquisition during spine scoring. We excluded from scoring images whose quality was not sufficient to score spines.

We scored spines similarly to prior work 32 but with a few modifications. We labeled protrusions as dendritic spines only if they extended laterally from the dendritic shaft by >0.4 μm ( Extended Fig. 6a, b ). We did not include protrusions of <0.4 μm in the analysis ( Extended Fig. 6c, d ). When a spine first appeared in the time-lapse image data we assigned it a unique identity. We preserved the spine’s identity across consecutive time points if the distances between the spine in question and two or three of its neighboring spines were stable. In ambiguous cases, which were hardly the norm, we required stability to <2 μm.

The surviving fraction, S ( t ), at time t was defined as the fraction of spines present on the first imaging day that were also present a time t later. For the deliberate purpose of attaining conservative estimates of ( e.g. lower bounds on) the proportion of impermanent spines, in the calculation of S ( t ) we handled the 18% of spines in the recurrent-location category ( Fig. 1d and Extended Fig. 1d,e ) in the following way. When checking pairs of images acquired an interval t apart, we deliberately did not distinguish between whether the second image contained the original spine or its replacement spine at the same location. This approach thereby underestimated spine turnover as inferred from analyses of S ( t ), implying that our conclusion of CA1 spine impermanence is not only mathematically conservative but also robust to any scoring errors in which we might have erroneously missed a spine that had in fact persisted to subsequent imaging sessions.

Turnover ratio was defined as the sum of spines gained and lost between two consecutive time points normalized by the total number of spines present at these time points. Spines lost or gained were defined as the number of spines lost or gained between two consecutive time points, respectively, normalized by the total number of spines present at these time points.

To make coarse estimates of spine volumes, for stable spines we determined each spine’s fluorescence within a manually drawn region of interest (ROI) in the axial section in which the spine head appeared at its biggest diameter. We normalized this value by the fluorescence value attained by moving the ROI to within the nearby dendritic shaft (as in Ref. 7 ).

To test for differences in spine densities, turnover ratios and surviving fractions either over time or between different groups, we used non-parametric two-sided statistical testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank and Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA tests) to avoid assumptions of normality and Dunn-Šidák correction for multiple comparisons Sample size was chosen to match published work 7 – 9 .

To compare experimentally measured spine survival to the theoretical predictions from kinetic modeling, we assessed the goodness-of-fit for each model by using both the reduced chi-squared statistic and the log-likelihood function (Supplementary Text, §VI). Both the mean and covariance of the surviving fraction depended on the model parameters and influenced the goodness-of-fit (Supplementary Materials, Appendix IV). We also required that the parameter describing the minimal separation needed to resolve two spines was 0.5–1 μm mm (other values for this minimal separation are implausible) (Supplementary Text, §VI).

We modeled the microscope’s optics based on prior measurements 14 and tuned the kinetics of spine turnover, spine geometries, and dendrite geometries to produce simulated image sequences that the data analyst judged to be similar to the actual data (Supplementary Text, §II and Extended Fig. 5 ). In some datasets, we matched the simulated spine kinetics to those inferred from our in vivo measurements.

( d ) In vivo , 22-day-long time-lapse image dataset sampled every three days. Over 50% of the spines underwent visually noticeable dynamic changes. Pie chart shows the proportions of spines that were persistent or exhibited different patterns of turnover ( N = 1075 total spines from 4 mice). Color-coding is the same as in Fig. 1d . Error bars are s.e.m.

In two groups of mice, each comprising two Thy1-GFP transgenic animals (8–10 weeks old), we implanted the imaging guide tube just dorsal to hippocampal area CA1 following established procedures 4 , 16 , 33 . We sacrificed, sliced and stained the first group after two further weeks (a), and the second group after five further weeks (b). Confocal fluorescence images of the stained tissue slices revealed activated microglia (CD68 staining, upper panels , red), astrocytes (GFAP staining, lower panels , red), GFP-expression pyramidal neurons (green), and permitted quantifications of spine density in CA1 regions both ipsilateral and contralateral to the implant.

( a ) Two weeks after implantation, confocal photomicrographs (maximum intensity projection of 4 separate z -planes, axially spaced 0.2 μm apart) revealed a limited presence of activated microglia (red arrowheads indicate single cells) on the implanted hemisphere ( right upper panel ) but were virtually nonexistent in the contralateral control CA1 from the same mice ( left upper panel ). Staining for astrocytes on the implanted hemisphere ( right lower panel ) was almost indistinguishable from the control hemisphere ( left lower panel ), except for a 5–10 μm thick layer of astrocyte label abutting the optical surface of the imaging guide tube.

( b ) Five weeks after implantation, confocal photomicrographs (maximum intensity projection of 4 separate z -planes, axially spaced 0.2 μm apart) revealed an almost undetectable presence of activated microglia on the implanted hemisphere ( right upper panel ), comparable to the contralateral control hemisphere ( left upper panel ). Staining for astrocytes in the implanted hemisphere ( right lower panel ) was almost indistinguishable from the control hemisphere ( left lower panel ), except for a 5–10 μm thick layer of astrocyte label abutting the optical surface of the imaging guide tube.

( c ) Mean density of spines on pyramidal cell basal dendrites in the implanted CA1 (white columns) was statistically indistinguishable from the contralateral control CA1 (black columns), at two weeks ( P = 0.21; Mann Whitney U test) and at five weeks ( P = 0.98; Mann Whitney U test) after implantation. Error bars are s.d.

( a–c ) Example two-photon microendoscopy (a), STED (b), and overlay (c), images of the same CA1 basal dendrite, acquired in a fixed brain slice from a Thy1- GFP mouse. Nearby spines that are clearly distinguishable in the STED image (green arrowheads) but within the diffraction-resolution limit of two-photon microendoscopy (0.85 NA) appear as single, merged entities within the two-photon image (red arrowheads). The two-photon image shown is the maximum intensity projection of 3 optical sections axially spaced 0.6 μm apart. The STED image is the maximum intensity projection of 6 optical sections spaced 0.3 μm apart. Scale bar is 2 μm.

( d, e ) To attain an approximate measure of spine volume, we quantified each spine’s fluorescence in manually drawn regions-of-interest (ROIs) and normalized it by the fluorescence value in the nearby dendritic shaft, within an ROI of identical shape and size within a single axial section of the two-photon image stack. To ascertain whether each of the spines scored in the two-photon images was actually a merged spine or not, we consulted the STED images of the same dendrite. Plotted are the normalized fluorescence values, (d), for unitary spines as well as doublet and triplet merged spines (black lines: mean values ± s.e.m.; colored points: data from individual spines), and the cumulative distributions of these measurements, (e). The distributions of normalized fluorescence were statistically indistinguishable ( P > 0.06; Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA; N = 100, 30, and 7, respectively, for unitary, doublet and triplet spines), likely reflecting the substantial range of CA1 spine geometries ( Extended Fig. 9 ).

(a) Surviving fraction curves for models in which the fraction of permanently stable spines is γ = 0 (red curve) and γ = 0.3 (purple curve) (Supplementary Methods, §I). The time scale of spine survival was τ = 1, and the filling fraction value was f = 0.2. The surviving fraction asymptotes to a value, S ∞ , that encodes the fraction of stable spines. (Supplementary Information has a list of all mathematical variables used in this work, and their definitions).

(b) The time asymptotic value of the surviving fraction (green curve) exceeds the fraction of stable spines (dashed blue line). Colored circles correspond to the surviving fraction curves plotted in (a).

(a) Example simulated images (Supplementary Methods, §II) of dendrites for which the spine density was 0.6 μm −1 ( top ), 1.5 μm −1 ( middle ) , and 2.4 μm −1 ( bottom ).

(b) Ground truth and manual scoring of a simulated dendrite for which the spine density was 1.5 μm −1 . Green arrowheads indicate counting errors originating from the optical merging of spines (Supplementary Methods, §III). Blue arrowheads indicate counting errors that occur when the spine’s projection into the optical plane is too short (Supplementary Methods, §IV). Scale bar is 2 μm.

(c) The visually scored surviving fraction (red circles) differed from the true spine surviving fraction (blue triangles), but the departures were well predicted by the kinetic model (solid black curve) (Supplementary Methods, §V, VI).

( d ) We simulated and scored a long-term lapse imaging dataset with kinetic parameters that matched the best-fit model of Fig. 4b (Supplementary Methods, §II). Even though the dataset lacked stable spines, many simulated spines appeared to persist for long time intervals. Scale bar is 2 μm.

(e) Although the spine density in the simulated data was 2.56 μm −1 , visual scoring yielded a lower spine density. We used the measured and true spine densities to estimate the extent of merging and the counting resolution (Supplementary Methods, §VI). Data points are mean ± s.e.m.

We examined empirically whether variations in dendritic angle across different imaging sessions might impact determinations of spine turnover. However, the variations in dendritic angle that were actually present in our datasets were insufficient to cause illusory turnover.

(a, b) Dendritic spines can be detected when the angle ( θ ) between a spine and the normal vector is large (Supplementary Methods, §IV). View of a dendrite and spine in the ( x , z ), (a), and optical ( x , y ), (b), planes.

(c, d) Dendritic spines cannot be detected when the angle between a spine and the normal vector ( θ ) is small (Supplementary Methods, §IV). View of a dendrite and spine in the ( x , z ), (c), and optical ( x , y ), (d), planes.

( e ) For every dendrite and time point, we estimated the dendrite’s angle with respect to the optical plane, using the 3D coordinates of two manually labeled points on the dendrite chosen to flank the region of dendrite containing the scored spines. Over time, individual dendrites varied about their initial angle ( n = 55 dendrites tracked over 16 sessions; dataset of Fig. 3d ).

( f ) Distribution of the fluctuations in angle, pooled across the 55 dendrites, relative to the initial angle as seen in the first imaging session. The average magnitude of an angular fluctuation was 4.5°, and 90% of angular fluctuations were <10° in magnitude. Thus, a 5° fluctuation was typical in our dataset, whereas a 10° fluctuation was atypically large.

( g ) To determine if variability in the imaging angle might impact determinations of spine turnover, we imaged 18 dendrites in fixed slices while deliberately tilting the imaging plane by 0°, 5° and 10°. We made a total of 989 spine observations. Over 95% of spines scored in the 0°-condition were also correctly scored when the specimen as tilted by 5° or 10°. Overall, the level of angular fluctuations in the in vivo imaging data has virtually no impact on turnover scores.

(a) Diagram of the kinetic scheme used to describe merged spine dynamics (Supplementary Methods, §V). Each state is labeled by the number of actual spines that have merged in appearance to a single spine (a quantity that we call the merged spine order (Supplementary Methods, §III)). State ‘0’ indicates the absence of a spine, and state ‘1’ indicates a spine that is truly unitary. Transitions occur between adjacent states in the kinetic ladder diagram with rate constants r mn .

(b) The rate constants governing increases in merged spine order depend on two parameters (Supplementary Methods, §V): ( i ) the initial state or merged spine order; and ( ii ) the overall degree of merging in the spine image dataset, which is proportional to the product of the spine density and the shortest resolvable inter-spine interval (denoted L ) (Supplementary Methods, §III). In contrast, the rate constants governing decreases in merged spine order (inset) depend only on the initial merged spine order (Supplementary Methods, §V).

(c) In the case when all spines are labile, a collapsed kinetic scheme in which a single state (Ψ) combines all merged spine orders above zero approximates the complete model ( d ) and can be solved mathematically (Supplementary Methods, §V).

(d) The surviving fraction curve generated from the collapsed kinetic scheme (blue curve) fits the empirically observed surviving fraction (black data points) as well as the best-fit model (red).

(e) The asymptotic value of the surviving fraction is a function of the degree of merging (Supplementary Methods, §V). A large degree of merging (as in CA1, blue circle) produces a larger asymptotic value of the merged spine surviving fraction than a small degree of merging (as in neocortex, purple circle).

(f) The estimated lifetime of merged spines is a function of the degree of merging (Supplementary Methods, §V). A large degree of merging (as in the hippocampal CA1, blue circle) produces a longer relative lifetime of merged spines than a small degree of merging (as in the neocortex, purple circle).

To study potential effects of fluctuations in spine geometry, we used values for the means and variances of dendrite radius, spine length, and spine radius that were determined by electron microscopy 17 , 34 . We then computationally examined how time-dependent fluctuations in these parameters would affect determinations of spine surviving fraction (Supplementary Methods, §VII).

(a) We examined how fluctuations in dendrite radius, spine radius, spine length and spine angle — individually (colored data points) and all together (black data) — affect the spine surviving fraction when the fluctuating geometric parameters are chosen stochastically in each of two imaging sessions, as a function of the parameter’s time-correlation between the two sessions (Supplementary Methods, §VII). As expected, when the two sessions involved image pairs that were perfectly correlated, the surviving fraction reached 100%. Fluctuations in all four parameters had greater effects than fluctuations in individual geometric parameters.

(b) To estimate the time-dependence of the surviving fraction of scorable spines from (a), we assumed all geometric parameters evolved according to the time-correlation function that we empirically determined from in vivo imaging data ( Extended Fig. 9d ).

(c) The apparent surviving fraction is the product of the true surviving fraction and the surviving fraction of scorable spines (Supplementary Methods, §VII). For the best-fit kinetic model, the apparent surviving fraction is very close to the true surviving fraction.

(d) The difference between the fitted timescale of the apparent surviving fraction and the true survival timescale is small across the range of model parameters consistent with the in vivo data (Supplementary Methods, §VII).

(e) The graph plots the lower bound of the surviving fraction of scorable merged spines as a function of the time-correlation function shared by all four geometric parameters, for different merged spine orders. As this lower bound increases rapidly with the merged spine order, artifactual turnover due to unscorable spines is unlikely when spine merging is common (Supplementary Methods, §VII).

(f) We combined Fig. 4c and Extended Fig. 8e to bound the turnover that could result from unscorable spines (Supplementary Methods, §VII). As the empirically measured surviving fraction falls below the lower bound obtained for the surviving fraction of scorable merged spines, ongoing changes in the geometric parameters of spines cannot account for the observed spine turnover.

(d) Experimental spine length time-correlation function and its exponential fit (Supplementary Methods, §VII).

To attain an approximate measure of spine volume for stable spines, we quantified each spine’s fluorescence in manually drawn regions-of-interest (ROIs) and normalized it by the fluorescence value in the nearby dendritic shaft, as determined within a ROI of identical shape and size in a single z -section image acquired by two-photon microendoscopy. In addition, each spine’s fluorescence value at each time point is normalized to its own mean over the entire experiment.

Dashed black line in (a) indicates the mean over all imaging sessions.
