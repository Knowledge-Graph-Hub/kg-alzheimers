# Title
Genetic association analyses implicate aberrant regulation of innate and adaptive immunity genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus

# Abstract
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OMIM 152700) is a genetically complex autoimmune disease characterized by loss of immune tolerance to nuclear and cell surface antigens. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had modest sample sizes, reducing their scope and reliability. Our study comprised 7,219 cases and 15,991 controls of European ancestry: a new GWAS, meta-analysis with a published GWAS and a replication study. We have mapped 43 susceptibility loci, including 10 novel associations. Assisted by dense genome coverage, imputation provided evidence for missense variants underpinning associations in eight genes. Other likely causal genes were established by examining associated alleles for cis -acting eQTL effects in a range of ex vivo immune cells. We found an over-representation (n=16) of transcription factors among SLE susceptibility genes. This supports the view that aberrantly regulated gene expression networks in multiple cell types in both the innate and adaptive immune response contribute to the risk of developing SLE.

## ONLINE METHODS
We genotyped 4,946 SLE cases and 1,286 healthy controls using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (1,140,419 markers). The genotyped controls were mostly from southern Europe, matching our Spanish, Italian and Turkish cases with controls from the same countries. We also used data for 5,727 previously genotyped controls taken from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS). These subjects were genotyped using the Illumina Human2.5M Beadchip (2,443,179 markers).

The clinical features of our GWAS cohort were documented on the basis of standard ACR classification criteria. The experiment was designed to avoid batch effects to the greatest extent possible. All DNA samples were sent to the laboratory at King’s College London, UK, where the integrity of the DNA was checked. The GWAS samples were then genotyped at a single laboratory. All data analysis was carried out in the laboratory at King’s College.

Genotyping for the GWAS was carried out using 82 plates, processed in 13 batches. Duplicate samples taken from HapMap Phase 3 were added to each plate to check genotyping quality. Case-control status and country of recruitment were randomized across plates as far as possible, in order to avoid artifactual differences in genotyping between plates affecting association statistics.

Our final dataset comprised genotyping of 644,674 SNPs for 4,036 SLE cases and 6,959 controls (1,260 controls of mainly southern European ancestry and 5,699 from the HRS).

We analyzed data from a previous genome-wide association study of SLE (the Hom et al. study), which comprised 1,165 cases following our QC analysis (see Supplementary Text ). We used a further 2,107 previously genotyped controls from the NIH CGEMS study, which were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 chip. Owing to the lower density of genotyping, in some cases data imputed to the density of the 1000 Genomes (1KG) study were used in the analysis of the Hom et al. study and the subsequent meta-analysis. Imputed data are identified in tables.

A cohort of 2,310 cases not included in any previous genetic study of SLE was genotyped using a custom array. The largest group of samples was from the UK, followed by cohorts from France, the USA, Germany and Canada.

The control data for the replication study comprised 3,672 subjects from the HRS cohort (independent of those used in the GWAS), 3,102 subjects from a study of melanoma and 1,202 subjects from a study of blood clotting. These control data were genotyped using the Illumina 2.5M chip. Following QC procedures ( Supplementary Text ), the final control dataset comprised 6,925 individuals: 3,668 from the HRS, 2,889 from the melanoma study and 368 from the blood clotting study. The final case dataset consisted of 2,018 samples.

In some cases, SNPs identified by our GWAS as genome-wide significant were not present in the replication control data (owing to absent genotyping in one of the three control sets following QC), and so genotypes for those SNPs were imputed (see below). Again, we identify these SNPs in our results tables.

The UK subjects with SLE in the study were recruited with the study having obtained ethical approval from the London Ethics Committee (MREC/98/2/06 and 06/MRE02/9). Individuals were invited into the study and given information sheets as well as verbal explanations of what the research entailed. For those individuals willing to participate informed written consent was obtained. The recruitment in continental Europe and Canada were subject to local review and ethical approval. Copies of the relevant supporting documentation were sent to the investigators at King’s College at the commencement of the study.

Initial QC analysis of the genotype data was carried out in accordance with Illumina’s Technical Note on Infinium Genotyping Data. In silico QC checks were carried out of: Individual missingness (3% threshold) SNP missingness (3% threshold) Identity-by-descent (IBD, 0.125 threshold) Population structure Minor allele frequency (MAF, 0.002 threshold) Autosomal heterozygosity X chromosome heterozygosity Y chromosome calling and homozygosity Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (control data only)

IBD analysis included checks both within and across cohorts; no subject in the main GWAS or Hom et al. study is related to any other subject in either cohort. We calculated principal components for the GWAS data using the EIGENSTRAT algorithm 12 , and derived the empirical genomic inflation factor 13 , 69 for these data. As noted by Price and colleagues 14 , the definition of genomic control means that λ GC is proportional to sample size. We therefore report λ 1000 , the inflation factor for an equivalent study of 1000 cases and 1000 controls 15 , 70 , in the main text, as well as λ GC .

For the replication cohort, population structure was estimated using 46 ancestry informative markers (following QC measures on these SNPs). As described in Supplementary Text , we merged these data with HapMap data to help identify non-European samples. Again, principal components were calculated using the EIGENSTRAT algorithm. 120 subjects that clustered with the non-European HapMap populations were removed from the analysis.

During QC analysis, we identified subjects in our GWAS cohort with abnormal karyotypes, consistent with Klinefelter’s syndrome (47, XXY). Three of the 365 male cases in our main GWAS have clinical and genetic data that confirm their status as Klinefelter’s sufferers ( Supplementary Text ). Given that the prevalence of Klinefelter’s syndrome in the general population is estimated to be 0.1 – 0.2% 31 , this estimate suggests an approximately four- to eight-fold increase in prevalence compared with 46, XY males, consistent with Klinefelter’s males and 46, XX females having a similar risk of developing SLE.

All case-control analysis was carried out using the SNPTEST 71 , 72 algorithm; we use a standard threshold of P = 5 × 10 −8 for reporting genome-wide significance throughout. The inverse variance method was used for meta-analysis. All markers were fully genotyped in the main GWAS (i.e, no imputation was carried out). The imputation carried out for the Hom et al . and replication studies, and fine mapping imputation, are described below.

For all SNPs at which we report a novel association with SLE, we compared allele frequencies in the main GWAS controls with those in publically available control cohorts (1KG European samples 18 , Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) genotypes 73 , TwinsUK samples, HapMap CEU population data, and sample genotypes from the Knight laboratory expression data 23 ). We tested for a statistically significant (α = 0.01) difference in allele frequency between our GWAS and the public controls, using a 1 degree of freedom χ 2 test of allele frequencies. One SNP failed this test (rs1439112, MGAT5 ) and was removed from further analysis. In three further cases, the difference in allele frequency strengthened our observed association. These data are presented in Supplementary Table 7 .

Gene names listed in results tables were identified by overlaying GWAS results onto the UCSC Genome Browser. We adopted a threshold based on linkage disequilibrium: for each SNP, we noted the set of markers with R 2 > 0.75 with respect to the SNP of interest ( Table 2 ).

Checks carried out following case-control analysis included examination of plots of raw genotype intensity; this was of particular relevance given the increase in the numbers of relatively rare variants due to the higher density of genotyping (as with imputation, genotype calling is by definition more difficult for rarer variants). We checked that the intensity plots showed clusters of genotypes (i.e., homozygotes or heterozygotes) that were compact and well discriminated. This check was also carried out with stratification by QC group. Plots of intensity were examined for each associated SNP, and for all of the SNPs in the replication study.

We selected SNPs for the replication study based on the results of the meta-analysis of the two GWA studies. At loci with no known association in SLE, we adopted a threshold of P = 2.5 × 10 −05 , while for loci with previously reported associations the threshold was set at P = 1 × 10 −04 . This followed the methodology used in Box 1 of the WTCCC study of seven common diseases 73 . This declared SNPs as associated if the posterior odds of association were greater than 10. In that study, the assumption was made that 10 detectable genes were present, so the prior odds of a true association would be in the order of 100,000:1, assuming 1,000,000 independent regions in the genome. Based on the autoimmune genetics literature, we have assumed that there are likely to be as many as 500 genes associated with SLE. We have required posterior odds in favour of a SNP being associated to be >1 (as opposed to >10, which would be advisable if declaring an association rather than choosing SNPs for replication). This gives a P -value threshold of 2.5 × 10 −05 . For SNPs at loci with previously published SLE associations, we have reduced our threshold for inclusion in the replication study to P = 1 × 10 −04 . This is because a priori we believe these SNPs are more likely to be at susceptibility loci than those with no evidence of association, increasing the prior odds by at least a factor of 4.

For imputation, both the main GWAS and the Hom et al . data were pre-phased using the SHAPEIT algorithm 74 , and then imputed to the density of the 1KG study using IMPUTE 71 , 72 v2.2.3. Only markers with an IMPUTE INFO score > 0.7 were used in analysis. For SNPs identified in our GWAS as genome-wide significant at which data were absent in the replication study controls, we imputed over a +/– 1Mb region around the SNP of interest.

1KG data were used both to fine map loci and to determine whether multiple signals were present. For this analysis, we carried out a meta-analysis of 1KG imputed GWAS and Hom et al . data. Association testing was performed on the 1KG data within a 1 Mb window of the reported SNP. For the MHC, we included the complete 8 Mb region (26–34 Mb) in our analysis. To scan for further independent signals, association tests were performed including the genotype data for the most highly associated SNP as a covariate. If secondary signals were found to be associated by this analysis (with a P -value threshold of 5 × 10 −08 ) and odds ratios were consistent across the single marker and conditional analyses, the secondary signals were reported as independent associations.

In order to address the problem that the most associated (lead SNP, marker with the lowest p-value) variant is not necessarily the best candidate as the true causal variant, we considered markers from the most associated down to a defined cut-off. The cut-off was defined as a Bayes Factor (BF) against the most associated SNP equal to 0.34. This was derived from assuming a prior odds of causality for a non-synonymous SNP equal to 3, taken from an empirical analysis of GWAS annotation 19 , 75 . Any SNPs above this BF cut-off that were missense variants were declared as more likely candidates than the most associated SNP: assuming that the prior odds of a missense SNP (being causal) against a non-missense SNP to be equal to 3, any missense SNP with a BF > 0.34 will have a posterior odds > 1 and will therefore have a higher posterior probability than the most associated marker (if the most associated marker is non-missense). Therefore we searched for functional variants within a set of markers where inclusion in this set required a maximum Bayes factor (BF) > 0.34 between the marker and the most associated SNP in the 1KG imputed data. We considered any marker that had a BF > 0.34 with respect to the most associated marker, and noted whether any had functional effects. We calculated an approximate BF following Wakefield 76 , using a prior distribution on effect size (odds ratio) that was proportional to MAF (as rare variants are believed to have large effects, while common variants are believed to exert small effects). The BF threshold implies that we believe associations with functional variants, such as missense variants, three times more (say) than intergenic variants that do not correlate with gene expression. We then calculated posterior model probabilities following Maller et al. 77 , but with prior odds of 3 between missense SNPs and non-missense SNPs; Maller et al. use a uniform prior on all model probabilities (all SNPs are considered to have equal weights a priori , and therefore the prior odds are 1). We present these results in Supplementary Table 4 where we also, separately, display SNPs with a BF > 0.1 (as a strict threshold of 0.34 does not reflect the uncertainty in prior odds of causality and BF estimates). We also calculated the BF between SNPs presented in Table 1 and the SNPs listed in Supplementary Table 3a and declared that the marker for association had changed if the BF was greater than 10 (equal to “ strong ” evidence on the Jeffreys’ scale 78 ). These SNPs are annotated in Supplementary Table 3a .

We included imputed HLA alleles in analysis of the MHC, allowing us to determine the most likely model of association within this region. HLA imputation was performed using HLA*IMP V2 21 using genotyped SNP data. To determine the best model for association within the HLA alleles alone we ran forward stepwise regression. We then tested the five SNPs listed in Supplementary Tables 6a–c for association, conditional on the HLA alleles. To test whether each of the five SNPs was independent of the HLA alleles (rather than just the alleles in the best HLA model), we carried out a test conditional on all alleles (i.e., the HLA alleles were used as covariates) in each HLA gene, and for all HLA alleles over all genes. We used a significance threshold at each stage of the stepwise regression of P = 5 × 10 −05 , which is a Bonferroni adjustment for 204 tests (199 HLA alleles and 5 SNPs), with a familywise Type I error rate of 0.01.

Gene expression data were obtained from three sources: firstly, we obtained data from Fairfax et al. 22 , 23 and unpublished data from Fairfax and Knight for NK cells, naïve monocytes, monocytes stimulated by LPS (harvested after 2 hours and 24 hours), IFN and B cells. Secondly, we interrogated the Genevar database for LCL eQTL results, taking results from the MuTHER resource 79 . The CD4 (CD4 T cells) and CD14 (CD14/16 Monocytes) data were obtained from a previous study of gene expression in immune related cells 24 . An adjustment was made for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction, by counting the number of tests across all loci for genes within +/–1MB of the SLE associated SNP. With a familywise test size of 0.01, the P -value threshold was 1.41 × 10 −05 .

To test whether observed associations between SNPs and expression levels of cis -acting genes were purely due to chance, we calculated the RTC score 25 for all SNP-gene eQTL results displayed in the heat map ( Figure 1 ). This tests the null hypothesis that the GWAS associated SNP and the best eQTL (within a recombination hotspot) are tagging two separate effects, and the observed eQTL is purely due to the LD between the GWAS associated SNP and the “true” eQTL SNP. For our data, we were interested in the distribution of RTC scores, given that eQTL results were generated in multiple cell types. Not all eQTLs were consistently present across all these cells. We therefore plotted the RTC scores against the –log 10 P -values supporting each cis eQTL in all cell types ( Supplementary Figures 3a and 3b ). Supplementary Figures 3a and 3b show that three genes were outlying: ITGAM in two cell types, and UBE2L3 and PLD2 in CD4 cells. However, we have strong a priori evidence of a true causal effect on expression by polymorphisms around UBE2L3 26 . For ITGAM, we note the low RTC scores in Figure 1 , which includes all eQTL data for ITGAM given that the results are convincing for the eQTL in LPS stimulated monocytes ( P = 2.67 × 10 −19 and RTC = 0.85). We have removed the declaration of an eQTL for PLD2. Supplementary Figure 4 displays a heat map for these data using a t -statistic.
