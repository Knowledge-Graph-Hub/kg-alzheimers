# Title
A genetic cause of Alzheimer disease: mechanistic insights from Down syndrome

# Abstract
Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) — an Alzheimer disease risk factor — although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.

## Prevalence of AD-DS
A loss of cognitive function in middle-aged adults with DS was described soon after the identification of the syndrome 18 , and it was later shown that this loss resulted from the onset of AD dementia. As indicated above, AD is now common in adults with DS who are over the age of 40 years and, like other genetic forms of EOAD, develops two to three decades earlier in individuals with DS than in the general population. Data describing the prevalence of AD-DS vary between studies because of diagnostic issues, such as the presence of variable premorbid deficits, and survey methodology 19 . However, the prevalence of AD in people who have DS is <5% under the age of 40 ( REF. 20 ) and then roughly doubles with each 5-year interval up to the age of 60. Hence, approximately 5–15% of individuals with DS aged 40–49 years and >30% of those aged 50–59 years experience significant cognitive decline, indicating dementia ( FIG. 1 ). Thus, as with AD in the general population, age is a strong independent risk factor for AD-DS 21 . By the age of 65, 68–80% of individuals with DS have been shown to have developed dementia 6 , 7 ( FIG. 1 ; Supplementary information S1 (table)), and some studies of institutionalized people with DS suggest that rates are even higher 6 , 20 , 22 . However, not all older individuals with DS develop dementia, with some reaching their 70s without significant symptoms of AD despite having full trisomy of chromosome 21 ( REF. 23 ). After the age of 60, prevalence rates decrease, probably owing to the high mortality rate that is associated with dementia 21 .

The average age at which menopause begins in women with DS correlates with the age of onset of dementia 24 – 26 ; however, unlike the incidence of AD in euploid individuals, gender does not affect the incidence of AD-DS 20 , 21 . The reasons for this difference between the two populations are unknown, although it is possible that trisomy may cause changes in hormonal or cardiovascular biology that alter AD risk. The influence of gender on dementia development is complex in both the DS and euploid populations, and warrants more-extensive, longitudinal, population-based study.

Although increased levels of triglycerides and total body fat and low rates of exercise are reported in adults with DS 27 , and higher cholesterol levels have been associated with the risk of developing dementia in this group 28 , individuals with DS have lower rates of other cardiovascular risk factors — including hypertension, atherosclerosis and smoking 29 , 30 — that are thought to contribute to the development of dementia in the general population 31 . Further studies are required to understand how trisomy alters the biology of the cardiovascular system and what impact this has on neurodegeneration in people who have DS.

The brain reserve hypothesis is based on the observation that, in the general population, individuals with higher levels of education and/or more-active social and intellectual lifestyles have a lower risk of developing dementia 32 . The hypothesis predicts that individuals with more-severe premorbid cognitive impairment will have an increased risk of developing dementia. However, no convincing relationship between severity of intellectual disability (or intelligence quotient (IQ) score) and risk of AD has been found in people with DS 33 , possibly because of diagnostic difficulties in those with severe impairments. Survival time for AD-DS does not differ much from that for late-onset AD (LOAD), with estimates varying between 3.5 years (s.d 2.2) 34 and 6.24 years (s.d. 4.1) 6 . However, individuals with severe intellectual disability and dementia were found to have a longer survival time after diagnosis than those with milder intellectual disability 6 , further suggesting that reduced brain reserve does not accelerate disease progression in AD-DS.

Thus, people who have DS are at a greatly increased risk of developing dementia, with approximately 70% of individuals developing the condition by the age of 65. However, unlike the situation for LOAD, gender and cognitive reserve do not seem to influence AD-DS onset.

## Clinical features of AD-DS
The early symptoms of AD-DS include features that are typical of other forms of AD, such as a decline in memory and language skills that may be present several years before dementia is diagnosed 35 – 37 . However, changes in personality and behaviour are more common in the early stages of AD-DS than they are in other forms of AD: individuals typically display either apathy, lack of motivation and stubbornness, or increasing behavioural excesses and impulsivity. These ‘non-cognitive’ changes (also referred to as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs)) 38 – 42 are associated with deficits in executive functioning and with the frontal atrophy that is visible on MRI scans, which may indicate frontal lobe dysfunction 40 , 43 . These changes may be related to pre-existing deficits in the integrity of the frontal tracts that have been observed in individuals with DS 44 and that may be worsened by Aβ deposition in the frontal lobes 45 . Although BPSDs are very prominent in early AD-DS, this presentation is not unique to these individuals — it also occurs, albeit at lower rates, during the early stages of LOAD 46 and EOAD 47 , particularly in cases arising from mutations in the AD risk gene presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ; which maps to chromosome 14). Further studies are required to determine the earliest changes associated with the development of dementia in people who have DS, and to delineate other clinical differences between AD-DS, LOAD and familial forms of EOAD, such as the frequencies of co-morbidities that may affect the onset and progression of dementia (for example, cardiovascular disease and systemic infections).

Another feature of AD-DS is the more-frequent and earlier appearance of neurological symptoms such as gait disturbance and seizures 19 when compared with LOAD. Although heterogeneous, seizures associated with AD-DS often initially present with myoclonic jerks before progressing to tonic–clonic seizures and later to non-epileptic myoclonus with cerebellar signs; electroencephalograms show diffuse slowing and spike-and-wave patterns 48 – 50 . In individuals with LOAD, both complex partial and tonic–clonic seizures have been reported to be the predominant type 51 , 52 . Although seizures are reported to occur in 0.5–64% of people with LOAD 51 , more-recent population studies have suggested that seizure incidence in LOAD is relatively low, occurring in <5% of cases of the disease 53 . By contrast, most people with AD-DS eventually develop seizures, and a sudden onset of seizures in older adults with DS is highly suggestive of AD. Co-morbid seizures are associated with a more-aggressive course of AD-DS 54 and a greater dementia-associated mortality rate 6 . The mechanism underlying this striking clinical feature of AD-DS is not understood, and the study of this may provide significant insights into neurodegeneration, in particular how changes in neuronal structure and organization affect disease progression.

Similarly to other forms of AD, the decline through middle-stage AD-DS dementia progressively affects more cognitive domains and results in symptoms such as dyspraxia, increasing incontinence and pathological grasping and sucking reflexes 55 , 56 , as well as symptoms of parkinsonism 22 . In summary, BPSDs may be an important early feature of AD-DS, and seizures are commonly associated with AD-DS. However, further comparative and mechanistic studies are required to unravel the importance of these clinical observations.

## Neuropathological changes in AD-DS
The similarity between the neuropathological changes that occur in AD-DS and those that characterize AD in other individuals was first noted in 1929 ( REF. 57 ) and was important for the widespread recognition of dementia in people who have DS. This discovery also had a key role in the identification of Aβ as the major constituent of amyloid plaques 58 , the identification of the first AD gene, APP 59 , and the subsequent development of the amyloid cascade hypothesis 60 .

The overall distribution and biochemical composition of plaques (largely composed of Aβ) and NFTs (largely composed of tau protein (encoded by microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT ))) in people who have DS, EOAD and LOAD are similar 58 , 61 – 63 . However, a greater deposition of plaques and tangles occurs in the hippocampus in AD-DS than in EOAD 64 and, consistent with this, histological studies suggest that the earliest Aβ deposition in AD-DS occurs in the hippocampus 65 , whereas in LOAD the earliest deposition occurs in the basal cortex 66 . Furthermore, a lower density of Aβ plaques has been reported in the cortex in AD-DS than in LOAD 64 , 67 , 68 . These differences may relate to amyloid plaques in AD-DS having a more amorphous morphology and a larger average size than those present in LOAD 69 , 70 , resulting in a lower density caused by the presence of fewer but larger plaques. In addition, the aggregation kinetics of Aβ may differ in people with DS because of a higher concentration of the peptide resulting from their additional copy of APP . Alternatively, differences in plaque load may result from the neurodevelopmental differences that occur in people who have DS, resulting in changes in synaptic activity, which is known to regulate Aβ production 71 .

In AD-DS, intracellular accumulation of Aβ precedes extracellular plaque accumulation 72 – 75 but becomes less prominent in older individuals with extensive pathology, as also observed in LOAD 76 . Additionally, in AD-DS, diffuse plaques composed of non-fibrillary deposits of Aβ develop before those with dense cores that are composed of amyloid ( Supplementary information S2 (table)) 34 , 64 , 65 , 73 , 74 , 77 – 88 . Diffuse plaques are typically not associated with other forms of neuropathology, such as activated glial cells or synaptic loss, whereas dense-core plaques are often associated with dystrophic neurites and activated astroglia and microglia 89 . Also, Aβ 42 — a form of Aβ that has a high tendency to aggregate — accumulates before deposition of Aβ 40 in AD-DS 73 , 74 , 80 , which is consistent with the higher abundance of Aβ 42 reported in plaques in other forms of AD 89 . Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) — the deposition of Aβ within cerebral blood vessels — is also observed in older individuals with DS 74 , 80 , 87 , 90 . However, unlike in LOAD, infarcts 64 and vascular dementia seem to be rare in AD-DS 91 , although cases of CAA-associated cerebral haemorrhage have been described 92 – 95 .

In contrast to the findings of the histological studies described above, in vivo amyloid imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) indicates that the earliest site of Aβ accumulation in AD-DS, as in EOAD, could be the striatum 96 and that enhanced deposition may occur in the frontal and parietal cortex 97 . This discrepancy may be because amyloid imaging recognizes only a subset of Aβ aggregates, thus not all deposition may be detected 98 . Nonetheless, most individuals with DS have amyloid-positive PET scans by the age of 50 ( REFS 45 , 96 , 99 , 100 ). Amyloid load, as measured by PET, does not correlate well with cognitive function in adults who have DS in cross-sectional studies 45 , 99 , highlighting the importance of factors other than amyloid in the development of dementia. However, longitudinal imaging studies in this population have yet to be undertaken and may be highly informative 45 , 99 .

No NFTs have been reported in AD-DS in the absence of dense-core plaque pathology, which is consistent with the predictions of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. The density of NFTs triples between the fourth and fifth decade of life in AD-DS 77 , mirroring the onset of dementia, and NFT formation rather than amyloid deposition correlates best with cognitive decline 34 , which is consistent with similar findings in LOAD. Thus, changes in tau may result in neuronal dysfunction in both AD-DS and LOAD. Interestingly, smaller relative changes in nucleolar volume and a trend of reduced cell loss have been reported in the cortex and locus coeruleus in AD-DS compared with LOAD, despite comparable NFT loads, although similar cell loss was observed in other brain areas 68 . This may reflect a differential response of the trisomic CNS to accumulation of aggregated tau — suggesting, intriguingly, that chromosome 21 could encode a gene (or genes) that is neuroprotective when triplicated. Further study is required to determine whether trisomy 21 may provide protection from neurodegeneration.

As with people in the euploid population, people who have DS may have extensive amyloid deposition but no clinical signs of dementia ( FIG. 1 ). Understanding how pathological changes due to AD relate to cognitive dysfunction is therefore a key research challenge. Identifying the processes that cause an amyloid-laden brain to convert from cognitively intact to impaired is crucial for understanding and successfully treating AD. As people who have DS develop amyloid deposition and NFTs by the age of 40, study of this group of individuals is likely to provide an important insight into the factors that cause dementia. Indeed, observations of AD-DS neuropathology already underpin our mechanistic understanding of AD, providing a detailed sequence of pathological changes and how these may relate to changes in cognition.

Pathological features other than plaques and NFTs also develop in both AD-DS and LOAD. Neuronal accumulation of ubiquitylated and aggregated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43; also known as TARDBP) in the cytoplasm and neurites is similar in AD-DS (7–14% of cases) and familial AD (10–14% of cases), whereas TDP43 neuropathology occurs more frequently in LOAD (29–79% of cases), perhaps because of the later disease onset 101 , 102 . Lewy bodies, particularly in the amygdala, occur at a similar frequency in AD-DS and LOAD 103 , but dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is characterized by cognitive decline with hallucinations and parkinsonism features, is rare in DS 104 . Granulovacuolar degeneration, the formation of electron-dense granules in double-membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles, associated with plaque and NFT pathology occurs at a similar frequency in AD-DS and AD 64 . How this pathology relates to the very early endosomal abnormalities that are reported to occur before birth in individuals with DS 105 is unclear and warrants further investigation. Recent AD-related genome-wide association studies have highlighted the importance of the endosomal system in LOAD 106 , indicating that this system may be of particular significance to disease.

## AD-DS versus Dup-APP-associated AD
Dup- APP is a rare cause of familial EOAD, and comparison with AD-DS yields pathogenetic insights, as an additional copy of APP is present in both diseases. They therefore differ from other forms of familial AD that are the result of mutations in APP , PSEN1 or PSEN2 that modulate the processing of APP and the generation of Aβ. In Dup- APP , regions of chromosome 21 triplication vary in size 8 – 15 , 47 , 107 , 108 ( FIG. 2 ); the smallest known duplication contains only an additional copy of APP and no other coding genes 8 . By contrast, in AD-DS, triplication of any chromosome 21 gene in addition to APP may modulate the development of dementia. Studying these genes may therefore provide novel insights into AD mechanisms.

The age of onset of dementia in individuals with Dup- APP ranges from 39 to 64 years (mean age ~52 years), and dementia shows virtually complete penetrance by the age of 65 years. By contrast, there is a broad variation in age of onset in AD-DS, and many individuals present with significant cognitive decline only after the age of 55 years, or even escape it altogether. This is remarkable given the usual co-morbid health issues and relative lack of brain reserve in individuals with DS. Thus, a possible protective mechanism (or mechanisms) from triplication of an unknown gene (or genes) on chromosome 21 may be important for resistance to dementia in people with DS. Moreover, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is common in individuals with Dup- APP (occurring in 20–50% of cases) 9 – 14 , 47 , 108 , whereas individuals with DS are generally protected from this pathology, with only occasional reports. Thus, triplication of a chromosome 21 gene (or genes) may protect against some AD co-morbidity, and further comparative study of AD-DS and Dup- APP is required to understand the mechanisms underpinning this observation.

The few histopathological Dup- APP studies that have been carried out report diffuse atrophy with associated neuronal loss, deposition of plaques, CAA and accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ 40 and NFTs 11 , 109 , and this pathology seems to be similar to AD-DS pathology ( Supplementary information S3 (table)). However, further studies are needed 75 , 109 . Clinical DLB and cortical Lewy bodies have been observed in a few cases 11 , 13 , 109 , but currently there are insufficient data on these phenotypes to compare Dup- APP with AD-DS or LOAD. As in AD-DS, there is a greatly increased risk of dementia-associated seizures in Dup- APP 10 – 13 , 47 , in contrast to LOAD, in which seizures are relatively rare. This suggests that duplication of APP , and possibly of other genes located nearby, could be epileptogenic; however, as late-onset seizures often follow onset of dementia, they may also be related to synaptic deterioration that results in abnormal synchronization of neuronal networks and hyperexcitability 110 .

## Genes and mechanisms in AD-DS
The presence of three copies of a dosage-sensitive gene (or genes) on chromosome 21 results in greatly enhanced risk of AD. Chromosome 21 carries 233 coding genes, 299 long non-coding genes (Ensembl release 78) and 29 microRNAs (miRBase release 21) 111 ; thus, one or more of these must have a key role in AD. The phenotype resulting from a dosage-sensitive gene depends on the number of copies of the gene in the genome. However, not all genes are dosage sensitive, as homeostasis often prevents a gene from being overexpressed and the regulation of expression is often dependent on environmental context 112 . Furthermore, trisomy 21 causes widespread transcriptional dysregulation 112 , 113 , which may be the result of aneuploidy rather than of triplication of a specific gene. The importance of this in AD-DS remains unclear. Finally, acceleration of the epigenetic changes associated with ageing occurs in the DS brain 114 — whether this alters gene expression or modulates the development of AD is an important area for future study.

The development of neuropathology and dementia varies significantly between individuals with DS, and understanding the factors (genetic or environmental) that cause this variation is likely to provide key insights into disease mechanisms. Below, we describe the genes that are currently implicated in the development of AD-DS and highlight the importance of further study of the genetics of AD-DS to understand how variation in the whole genome influences the development of disease.

The key dosage-sensitive gene for AD-DS is likely to be APP , as an additional normal copy of this gene is sufficient to cause EOAD in the absence of trisomy of the rest of chromosome 21 ( REFS 8 – 15 , 47 , 107 ). The additional copy of APP in DS does not typically cause substantial Aβ accumulation until the second or third decade of life, although amyloid pathology has been demonstrated in a few childhood post-mortem examinations ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 1 ). This lack of early Aβ accumulation may be due to APP not becoming dosage sensitive until adulthood, as suggested by both mouse and human studies 115 – 117 . However, increased levels of soluble Aβ 42 are found in ~50% of trisomy 21 fetal brains 118 , suggesting that APP may be dosage sensitive during fetal development of individuals with DS but that this change may not be sufficient to cause extensive Aβ deposition in the developing brain — perhaps because of efficient clearance. Consistent with this, overexpression of APP and/or increased levels of Aβ have been reported in trisomy 21 human cell models, including in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from infants or young adults with DS 119 – 122 . Although triplication of APP does not necessarily lead to enhanced expression of APP and subsequent increase in Aβ accumulation in all contexts, overexpression of APP is strongly linked to Aβ deposition in adult life. Thus, elucidating the factors that control the regulation of APP expression will considerably aid our understanding of AD.

Several proteins encoded by other chromosome 21 genes have been suggested to modulate APP processing and Aβ generation ( BOX 2 ; FIG. 3 ). For example, the transcription factor ETS2 is thought to transactivate the APP promoter, leading to overexpression 123 . The chromosome 21-encoded proteins small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 (SUMO3) and dual-specificity tyrosinephosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) modify APP post-translationally, which may alter Aβ generation 124 – 126 . Additionally, the chromosome 21 microRNA miR-155 has been suggested to modulate γ-secretase activity and hence the processing of APP, through its effect on the expression of sorting nexin 27 ( REF. 127 ). Moreover, the β-secretase responsible for processing APP, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), has a homologue, BACE2, encoded on chromosome 21, which may influence the onset of dementia in people with DS 128 . BACE2 does not have β-secretase activity, and in fact cleaves APP on the carboxy-terminal side of the β-secretase cut site within the Aβ region, preventing generation of the peptide. Thus, enhancing BACE2 expression may be protective against accumulation of Aβ 129 . However, BACE2 overexpression does not alter Aβ accumulation in a mouse model 130 , and the protein does not seem to have enhanced expression in the adult DS brain 115 , 131 . Whether triplication of any chromosome 21 gene alters APP biology sufficiently to modulate the development of AD remains to be determined.

Polymorphisms in genes with important functions in LOAD have similar roles in the development of AD-DS; for example, the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) ε4 allele is associated with greater Aβ deposition, as well as with earlier onset and increased risk of AD-DS, whereas the APOE ε2 allele leads to reduced Aβ deposition and a lower risk of disease 132 – 138 . Similarly, variants of phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein ( PICALM ) and sortilin-related receptor 1 ( SORL1 ) influence age of onset in AD-DS, as they do in LOAD 132 , 139 , 140 , further supporting the theory that common mechanisms underlie both diseases. Whether variation in other genes with a role in LOAD is also important for AD-DS remains to be determined and is an important area for future study. Large-scale study of the genetic variants that contribute to the onset of dementia in AD-DS will provide an opportunity to gain insights into the mechanisms that underpin variation in the onset of dementia.

The earliest site of Aβ accumulation in AD-DS is within the neuron 72 – 75 , indicating that secretory and endosomal systems are central to Aβ generation. Moreover, an extra copy of APP is sufficient to cause endosomal enlargement and intracellular trafficking defects 141 , 142 via an Aβ-independent mechanism 143 . Enlargement of endosomes in trisomic neurons may cause axonal trafficking defects that contribute to neuronal degeneration 141 .

Triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP may also affect the secretory–endosome system, thereby affecting synaptic function, Aβ production and Aβ clearance. Small segmental duplications of the chromosome 21 endosome-to-Golgi-trafficking gene DOPEY2 ( REF. 144 ) have been associated with LOAD and mild cognitive impairment 14 , 145 , although this was not replicated in an independent study 146 . A reduction in the dose of the chromosome 21 gene cystatin B ( CSTB ), which encodes an endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins, decreases the accumulation of Aβ and associated cognitive deficits 147 . Overexpression of another chromosome 21 gene, synaptojanin 1 ( SYNJ1 ), which encodes a phosphoinositide phosphatase that regulates levels of membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, has been associated with endosomal enlargement 148 , whereas reduced expression of SYNJ1 lowers Aβ accumulation, as well as neuronal dysfunction and cognitive deficits 149 , 150 . How endosomal enlargement caused by trisomy contributes to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is another important area for future research.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur in people with DS and in trisomy 21 models 151 – 154 , and may contribute to the accelerated ageing reported in people who have DS 155 . Mitochondrial impairment may directly affect energy-hungry synapses, contributing to cognitive deficits 156 . Moreover, increased levels of ROS make trisomic neurons more prone to undergoing apoptosis, potentially making them more likely to degenerate 151 . Trisomy 21-associated increases in ROS levels may alter APP processing, promoting intracellular accumulation of Aβ 119 , 151 . Thus, protecting the trisomic brain from ROS may be of therapeutic value, although antioxidant supplementation has failed to show efficacy in preventing dementia in this population 157 . Interestingly, superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ), which has a key role in processing ROS, lies on chromosome 21, and upregulation of SOD1 seems to protect against APP and Aβ neurotoxicity 158 , perhaps by modulating Aβ oligomerization 159 . Consistent with this, higher SOD1 enzymatic activity correlates with better memory in adults with DS 160 . However, increased SOD1 activity has also been suggested to cause accelerated cell senescence by increasing the levels of hydrogen peroxide, a form of ROS 161 .

Several processes are likely to contribute to the intellectual disability associated with DS. These include a reduction in the numbers of neurons and dendritic spines, dendritic arborization, an alteration in the excitatory–inhibitory balance and a global impairment in network connectivity 68 , 162 – 166 . These perturbations in the structure, function and organization of the CNS may profoundly affect its degeneration in AD-DS ( BOX 1 ). Triplication of several chromosome 21 genes contributes to changes in neurodevelopment and/or neuronal function. For example, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16 (USP16) or DYRK1A upregulation alters stem cell fate 167 – 169 , which may in turn alter neuronal differentiation. Additionally, overexpression of several chromosome 21 genes (for example, the microRNA gene mir-155 and the protein-coding genes SYNJ1 , regulator of calcineurin 1 ( RCAN1 ), intersectin 1 ( ITSN1 ) and DS cell adhesion molecule ( DSCAM )) has been implicated in deficits in synaptic structure and function 148 , 170 , 171 . These genes may also play a part in AD-DS, perhaps via an effect on APP processing or on cognitive reserve. APP overexpression may also affect CNS function independently of the production and accumulation of Aβ, because the expression level of full-length APP influences neurogenesis, neuronal migration, axonal growth and the maintenance of the excitatory–inhibitory balance 172 , 173 . How the changes in CNS function caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 affect neurodegeneration in AD-DS is little understood and is a crucial area of future research.

Perturbations in intracellular signalling associated with trisomy 21 ( REF. 174 ) may affect the response of the CNS to pathological changes. For example, overexpression of the chromosome 21 genes RCAN1 and DYRK1A promotes aberrant phosphorylation of tau 152 , 175 – 177 . DYRK1A is dosage sensitive in the adult brain 178 , and overexpression of this gene modulates tau splicing, altering the relative abundance of tau with three or four microtubule-binding domains (3-repeat (3R) and 4R tau, respectively), which may affect the formation of NFTs 179 , 180 . Consistent with this, an increase in the ratio of 3R/4R tau has been reported to occur in AD-DS, as compared with LOAD or age-matched euploid individuals without dementia 179 , 180 . Additionally, an increase in the total amount of tau has been reported in the cortex in AD-DS as compared with that in age-matched euploid individuals without dementia, and in DS iPSC-derived neurons 122 , 179 ; this upregulation may be the result of increased APP levels 181 . DYRK1A also downregulates the levels of neural restrictive silencing factor (NRSF; also known as REST), a neuroprotective protein 168 , 169 , which has reduced expression in people with AD 182 . Variants in DYRK1A have been associated with risk of LOAD 183 , further indicating a possible role in disease pathogenesis, although this association was not replicated in an independent study 184 .

Alterations in cholesterol metabolism may contribute to the development of dementia 31 . Total cholesterol levels have been suggested to predict the onset of dementia in people with DS, particularly in those individuals who have an APOE ε4 allele 28 . Clinical trials are therefore underway to determine whether statins can prevent decline in older adults with DS, which may provide both clinical and mechanistic insights 185 . The chromosome 21 lipid transporter ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) has been suggested to regulate cholesterol efflux and may alter cholesterol metabolism in people with DS 186 . Whether trisomy of this gene is related to the development of AD-DS remains unclear, as ABCG1 overexpression has been reported both to increase and to decrease Aβ generation in vitro 187 , 188 and does not change Aβ accumulation in vivo 189 , suggesting that this gene may not be associated with the development of AD-DS. Further study is required to understand the mechanisms that underlie the link between increased cholesterol levels and the onset of dementia in individuals with DS.

Growing evidence shows that the immune system plays an important part in the development of AD 106 , 190 . Individuals with DS are at an increased risk of immune system dysfunction: these individuals have a higher incidence of both autoimmune and infectious disease 191 , and show upregulation of pro-inflammatory makers, including interleukin-1, in the brain 192 , 193 . This dysregulation may contribute to AD-DS through alterations in micro-glial activation 190 . Microglia in AD-DS have been reported to be associated with both mature Aβ plaques 194 and NFTs 195 , although the contribution of the immune response to AD-DS has yet to be fully explored. The chromosome 21 gene S100 calcium-binding protein beta ( S100B ) is expressed in astrocytes and is upregulated in both AD 196 and AD-DS 192 , and it may contribute to neurodegeneration by promoting Aβ deposition 197 and tau phosphorylation 198 and by creating a neurotoxic environment through the release of extracellular signals 199 .

## Translational research
The life expectancy of people with DS is increasing because of better health care and improved social inclusion. However, as with the euploid population, ageing brings new issues; in people with DS, a major ageing-related issue is a vastly increased risk of EOAD. People who have DS develop amyloid plaques and NFTs by the age of 40 years, and many individuals subsequently go on to develop dementia. Despite genetic and Aβ differences between the various forms of EOAD and LOAD, many similarities in disease process are observed such that AD seems to converge on common mechanisms of pathology. Thus, in the AD-DS patient population, it is feasible both to determine the factors (genetic and/or environmental) that cause conversion from pathological disease to cognitive decline and to undertake intervention trials to halt the development of dementia.

As APP gene dosage is the major determinant of AD-DS, it follows that therapies aimed at reducing Aβ (such as BACE inhibition or Aβ immunization) might have a beneficial effect in the DS population. Such approaches are being trialled for people with familial AD arising from APP or PSEN1 mutations 200 , and similar clinical trials in AD-DS could provide valuable additional insight, given the predictable conversion to AD neuropathology and subsequent dementia in this population. Other treatment options that require further development include DYRK1A inhibitors and ROS modulators. Notably, treatment safety is of particular importance because many individuals with DS are unable to consent to their own participation in clinical trials and because they will probably need to undergo treatment for many years.

## Conclusions
Many questions remain to be answered in AD-DS, including, most importantly, the mechanisms underlying the later onset of dementia as compared with Dup- APP , how neurodevelopmental perturbations affect neurodegeneration and the identity of any chromosome 21 gene (or genes) that may protect against dementia. We now have a remarkable set of tools for studying AD-DS, ranging from new model systems to genomics studies. Although there are undoubtedly specific problems in both analysing and treating people who have DS for AD, such as issues of informed consent, trisomy 21 is an extremely important disorder for learning about the development of neurodegeneration and for testing potential therapeutic strategies to the benefit of everyone at risk of AD.
