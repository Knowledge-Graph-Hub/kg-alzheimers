Modulation of TREM2 byCD33: a protein QTL study integrates Alzheimer loci in human monocytes

# Abstract
Here, we report results from a protein quantitative trait analysis in monocytes from 226 individuals to evaluate cross-talk between Alzheimer loci. We find that the NME8 locus influences PTK2B and that the CD33 risk allele leads to greater TREM2 expression. Further, we observe (1) a decreased TREM1/TREM2 ratio with a TREM1 risk allele, (2) decreased TREM2 expression with CD33 suppression, and (3) elevated cortical TREM2 mRNA expression with amyloid pathology.

## Online Methods
Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects. All blood draws, brain autopsies, experiments and data analysis were done in compliance with protocols approved by the Partners Human Research Committee and the Rush University Institutional Review Board.

Our study takes advantage of data and peripheral blood samples from healthy subjects in the PhenoGenetic Project at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The PGP was launched as a living biobank that provides a source of fresh and frozen biological samples derived from peripheral blood, urine and saliva of genotyped human subjects. 1,753 healthy subjects >18 years old have been recruited from the general population of Boston. The subjects are of diverse ethnicities (29% are non-Caucasian) and are 62.7% women. All subjects used for pQTL analyses were of European ancestry (n=165), as determined from principal components derived from genome-wide genotype data using EIGENSTRAT.

The HABS is a prospective study on cognitively non-impaired older subjects where the overall goal is to determine whether healthy individuals with increases in brain amyloid are in the prodromal stages of AD. For the study, participants, aged 65–90, come in for routine clinical and neuroimaging phenotyping as well as blood sampling; a detailed description of the study has been previously reported 10 . In total, 276 subjects are enrolled in the study and 161 are genotyped. The subjects are of diverse ethnicities (19% are non-Caucasian) and are 59.4% women. All subjects used for pQTL analyses were of European ancestry (n=61), as determined from principal components derived from genome-wide genotype data using EIGENSTRAT.

ROS and MAP are prospective studies of aging where study participants are cognitively normal at enrollment, agree to annual clinical evaluations and have signed an Anatomic Gift Act donating their brains at the time of death. Each subject undergoes a detailed quantitative neuropathological examination, detailed ante-mortem clinical and neuropsychological profiling, and banking of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The follow-up rate of survivors exceeds 90% and the autopsy rate exceeds 80%. A further description of ROS and MAP can be found elsewhere 21 – 23 . All subjects used for CD33 surface expression analysis (n=151) and TREM2 RNA analysis from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n=489) were of European ancestry, as determined from principal components derived from genome-wide genotype data using EIGENSTRAT.

PGP and HABS subjects were genotyped from whole blood DNA using the Illumina Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome BeadChip Kit (San Diego, CA) and the Affymetrix Axiom Biobank Genotyping Array (Santa Clara, CA), respectively. In short, EIGENSTRAT v3.0 was used to identify population outliers, which were discarded. The BEAGLE software (version: 3.3.2) was used to impute the post-QC genotyped markers using reference Haplotype panels from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium Phase I Integrated Release Version 3 (for PGP) or Version 1 (for HABS). These methods are described in detail elsewhere 12 .

In ROS-MAP, DNA was extracted from whole blood or frozen post-mortem brain tissue. Genotype data was generated using the Affymetrix Genechip 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute’s Genetic Analysis Platform or the Translational Genomics Research Institute, as previously described 24 . In short, data underwent quality control analyses using the PLINK toolkit ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/ plink/ ) and quality controlled genotypes were pooled. The quality control process included a principal components analysis using default parameters in EIGENSTRAT to identify and remove population outliers. Imputation in ROS-MAP was performed using MACH software (version 1.0.16a) and HapMap release 22 CEU (build 36).

For staining, frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each subject were thawed, washed, counted using the Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA), pre-treated with Fc receptor block (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and double-stained according to the manufacturer’s recommendations in the following combinations: (1) FITC-CD33 antibody (clone AC104.3E3) (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) with either APC-TREM1 antibody (clone TREM-26) (BioLegend), APC-TREM2 antibody (clone 237920) (R&D, Minneapolis, MN (for specificity see http://www.rndsystems.com/Products/FAB17291A and Jay et al. 20 )) or PE-TREML2 antibody (MIH61) (BioLegend) and (2) PE-CD33 antibody (clone AC104.3E3) (Miltenyi Biotec) with unconjugated PTK2B antibody (clone 9H12L1) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) followed by Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Cells were also single-stained with unconjugated TYROBP antibody (clone 406288) (R&D) followed by APC goat anti-mouse secondary (R&D). For intracellular staining (PTK2B and TYROBP), PBMCs were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Following staining with antibodies, cells were subsequently washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and analyzed within 24 hours. Data was collected on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec) and compensated and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR). Staining was performed in batches of 11–12 subjects and monocytes were gated based on forward-side scatter analysis or CD33-postive staining.

RNA was isolated from frozen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue of ROS-MAP subjects using the miRNeasy Mini Kit and RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). RNA concentration and quality were determined using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. Only samples with a RIN score >5 were used for library construction, which was assembled using the strand-specific dUTP method. The library was read using Illumina HiSeq with 101 base pair paired-end reads and a goal coverage of >85 million paired-end reads.

Monocytes were negatively isolated from PBMCs using the Monocyte Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec) and plated at 100,000 cells/well in 96-well round-bottom polypropylene plates with RPMI 1640-GlutaMax™ (Life Technologies), containing 10% FBS (Corning), 100 units/ml penicillin (Lonza), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Lonza), 2.5 µg/ml fungizone (Life Technologies) and either 10 µg/ml LEAF purified anti-CD33 antibody (clone WM53) (BioLegend) or isotype control (BioLegend). Control media without antibody was also used as a negative control. Clone WM53 was chosen because it has been previously shown to suppress CD33 inhibition of inflammatory cytokine secretion 25 . Monocytes were cultured for 48 hours after which they were washed and stained with Violet LIVE/DEAD Fixable Stain (Life Technologies), FITC-CD33 antibody (clone AC104.3E3) (Miltenyi Biotec) and APC-TREM2 antibody (clone 237920) (R&D). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. Subjects used for these studies were of European (n=22), African American (n=10), East Asian (n=9) and mixed Asian/European ancestry (n=2).

In summary, 26 SNPs were selected for the study (see Supplementary Table 2 for the complete list and associated references); these SNPs were (1) previously identified and/or validated in a meta-analysis of AD GWAS published by Lambert et al. , (2) found to have significant association with AD-related phenotypes (meeting genome-wide/Bonferroni significance), or (3) identified to have a significant cis -eQTL in monocytes (meeting Bonferroni significance). For the discovery phase, we limited our analysis to the 156 SNP:protein pairs (26 SNPs × 6 proteins) and created a p≤0.01 cut-off to identify suggestive trans -pQTL results. Four SNP:protein pairs met this threshold and were followed up in the validation phase leaving a Bonferroni significance threshold of p≤0.013 (p=0.05/4) to identify statistically-significant trans associations. A threshold of genome-wide significance, while critical in the gene discovery phase conducted by consortia of investigators to identify robust AD susceptibility loci to account for the millions of tested SNPs, is overly conservative and not appropriate in the type of follow-on functional study presented here, in which we take selected, validated susceptibility variants and conduct experiments to understand their functional consequences. Instead, we correct for the number of hypotheses being tested in the study.

Protein expression data was gathered in a series of five experiments, each consisting of 3–6 batches of 7–12 subjects/batch. European subjects were chosen randomly from available samples. The discovery dataset consisted of 176 unique subjects assayed over four experiments. Two of the experiments assayed samples from the PGP cohort (n=49, n=66) and the other two experiments assayed samples from the HABS cohort (n=31, n=30). An additional 50 unique subjects from the PGP cohort comprised the validation data set and were assayed in a single experiment. Each experiment was analyzed separately prior to being combined into a meta-analysis. In order to reduce undue influence of outliers and approximate a normal distribution within each experiment, expression levels were rank-based inverse normalized using Equation 1 . r ijk is the rank, N jk is the sample size, and Y ijk is the expression level, where i indexes the subject, j indexes the experiment and k indexes the protein. Equation 1 Y i j k t = ϕ − 1 ( ( r i j k − 3 8 ) / ( N j k − 6 8 + 1 ) ) After normalizing expression data, we performed linear regression for each SNP-protein pair, after first adjusting for batch using an Empirical Bayes priors distribution estimation framework (Combat version 2.0) available in the sva R package 26 . Within this regression, we set expression as the dependent variable and SNP as the independent variable, controlling for possible confounders such as age, sex, and cell viability. The t-statistics of each SNP-protein pair from the linear regressions of the discovery experiments were then meta-analyzed using the weighted-Z method as written in Equation 2 , which is commonly used in meta-analysis in the GWAS setting 27 , to produce discovery stage p-values. The validation experiment was similarly analyzed, producing validation stage p-values for those SNP:protein pairs selected at the end of the discovery analysis. The final joint analysis p-value (discovery plus validation) was the result of a meta-analysis of all five experiments - four discovery and one validation. Additionally, to derive empirical p-values for the joint meta-analysis, we permuted genotypes 10,000 times. Conditional SNP analyses were performed in a similar manner, where the linear regression was also adjusted for the conditional SNP. To calculate the effect of anti-CD33 antibody on TREM2 expression, a paired t -test on raw median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values based on live cell gating was applied to compare isotype and anti-CD33 conditions. To object a joint p-value combining the primary experiment and its replication, the weighted-Z meta-analysis method was used ( Equation 2 ).

In secondary analyses (e.g. analysis of co-expression, regressions conditional on expression, or reported effect estimates) the effects of batch and cell viability were removed from protein levels prior to analysis. To accomplish this, data from all experiments were collapsed into a single data set, expression levels were rank-based inverse normalized, and then adjusted for batch (23 in total) with Combat. Finally, expression levels were regressed against cell viability to produce analysis-ready residuals. For visual representation of the data in Figures 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figure 3 , batch adjusted residuals for PGP and HAB were created independently prior to plotting.

In the ROSMAP RNA-seq analysis, expression levels were obtained after applying a series of QC measures. FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of Exon Per Million Fragments Mapped) were first quantile normalized with Combat correcting for batch. Then, to obtain analysis ready residuals, log2(Combat adjusted FPKM) values were then regressed against RIN score, log2(total aligned reads), post-mortem interval, age, sex, cohort (ROS/MAP), genotyped PCs, and genotyping platform. Finally, residuals were rank-based inverse normalized. Amyloid and TREM2 were analyzed with linear regression, while pathological AD and TREM2 were analyzed with logistic regression. All analyses were conducted in R (version 3.0.2) and graphed in GraphPad Prism 6. A supplementary methods checklist is available.
