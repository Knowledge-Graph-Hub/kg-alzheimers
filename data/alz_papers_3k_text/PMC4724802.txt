# Title
Stably maintained dendritic spines are associated with lifelong memories

# Abstract
Changes in synaptic connections are considered essential for learning and memory formation 1 – 6 . However, it is unknown how neural circuits undergo continuous synaptic changes during learning while maintaining lifelong memories. Here we show, by following postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in the mouse cortex 7 – 8 , that learning and novel sensory experience lead to spine formation and elimination by a protracted process. The extent of spine remodelling correlates with behavioural improvement after learning, suggesting a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation and storage. Importantly, a small fraction of new spines induced by novel experience, together with most spines formed early during development and surviving experience-dependent elimination, are preserved throughout the entire life of an animal. These studies indicate that learning and daily sensory experience leave minute but permanent marks on cortical connections and suggest that lifelong memories are stored in largely stably connected synaptic networks.

## METHODS SUMMARY
Mice expressing YFP (H-line) were used in all the experiments. Sensory enrichment was conducted by placing mice in standard mouse cages containing strings of beads whose positions were changed daily. Motor training was performed by placing mice on an accelerated motorized rod. The rotation speed was recorded when the animal could not keep up with the rotating-rod and fell. The performance was measured as the average speed animals achieved during the 20-trial training session per day. The procedure of in vivo transcranial two-photon imaging, spine density measurement and data quantification was described previously 7 , 8 . P values were calculated using Student’s t -test.

## METHODS
Mice expressing YFP in Layer V pyramidal neurons (H-line) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and group-housed in the Skirball animal facilities. All experiments were done in accordance with institutional guidelines.

Sensory enrichment was conducted in standard mouse cages containing strings of beads hanging from the top of the cages ( Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ). The positions of bead strings were changed daily. Mice could move freely in these cages and had to navigate through the strings of beads to obtain food and water.

An EZRod system with a test chamber (44.5 cm × 14 cm × 51 cm, Accuscan Instruments) was used in this study. Animals were placed on the motorized rod (30 mm in diameter) in the chamber. The rotation speed gradually increased from 0 to 100 r.p.m. over the course of 3 min. The time latency and rotation speed were recorded when the animal was unable to keep up with the increasing speed and fell. Rotorod training/testing was performed in one 30-min session per day (20 trials in total). Performance was measured as the average speed animals achieved during the 20 trials. For control experiments, animals were either trialled 20 times by placing them on the still rod for 2 min, then dropped to the bottom of the chamber (no-training control), or by forcing them to run on the rod rotating at a constant speed of 15 r.p.m. (non-accelerated rotarod control, 60 min in total with a 20-s break every 5 min). A reverse running regime was introduced to provide pre-trained mice with a new motor learning experience. In this regime, animals were forced to run backwards on the rotating rod (speed increased gradually from 0 to 50 r.p.m. over 3 min) for 20 trials.

The location of imaging in the motor cortex is 1.3 mm anterior to the bregma and 1.2 mm lateral from the midline. In a previously published study 31 , this region has been identified through microstimulation as the location of forelimb representations in the same mouse strain as we used in our study. We confirmed this region of forelimb representations by microstimulation in our own hands. In addition, the location of imaging in the barrel cortex is 1.1 mm posterior to the bregma and 3.4 mm lateral from the midline. We have previously confirmed this location is within the barrel cortex using cytochrome oxidase staining 9 . Because our imaging window was rather small (200 μm × 200 μm), we chose to use stereotaxic coordinates of previously mapped forelimb and barrel regions as the guide to study spine dynamics in motor and barrel cortices.

The degree of spine formation and elimination was obtained from longitudinal studies by imaging the mouse cortex through a thinned-skull window. Because thinning the skull to ~20 μm at each imaging session without damaging the cortex becomes difficult after several chronic imaging sessions, we designed our experiments such that the same animals were imaged no more than four times. For the measurement of new spine survival in Fig. 2b, c , most but not all of the data came from chronic imaging of the same mice. For the measurement of new spine accumulation and existing spine survival in Fig. 4a, b , a total of 57 animals were used (most of them were imaged twice, eight of them were imaged three or four times).

The surgery and imaging procedures are described below.

Anesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine mix (20 mg ml −1 ketamine, 3 mg ml −1 xylazine in saline, 5–6 μl g −1 body weight).

Carefully shave the hair of the scalp with a double-edged razor blade. Make a midline incision of the scalp with sterile surgical scissors. The incision should extend from the middle of the ears to the frontal area.

Remove the periosteum tissue with a microsurgical blade. The brain area to be imaged was localized based on the stereotactic coordinates and marked with a fine marker.

Place a small amount of glue around the edges of the internal opening of the skull holding plate and press it against the skull for a few seconds. Make sure that the area to be imaged is exposed in the centre of the internal opening of the skull holding plate.

Wait approximately 5 min until the plate is stably glued to the skull and then place the mouse on a cotton pad on top of an optional heating pad. Attach the skull holding plate to the skull immobilization device. Wash away unpolymerized glue with artificial cerebrospinal fluid.

Use a high-speed micro-drill to thin a circular area of skull (typically ~0.5–1 mm in diameter) over the region of interest under a dissection microscope. Drilling should be done intermittently to avoid overheating. Replace the artificial cerebrospinal fluid periodically and wash away the bone debris.

The mouse skull consists of two thin layers of compact bone, sandwiching a thick layer of spongy bone. The spongy bone contains tiny cavities arranged in concentric circles and multiple canaliculi that carry blood vessels. Remove the external layer of the compact bone and most of the spongy bone with the drill. Some bleeding from the blood vessels running through the spongy bone may occur during the thinning process. This bleeding will usually stop spontaneously within a few minutes.

After removing most of the spongy bone, use a microsurgical blade to continue the thinning process until a very thin (~20 μm) and smooth preparation (~200 μm in diameter) is achieved.

Use a conventional epifluorescence microscope to check if dendrites and spines in the area of interest can be clearly visualized at this stage. The thickness of the skull can also be directly determined by visualization of the skull with a two-photon microscope.

A CCD (charge-coupled device) camera can be used to acquire a high-quality picture of the brain vasculature, which is used as a landmark for future relocation.

Carefully move the mouse to the two-photon microscope and select an area for two-photon imaging. The selected area is then carefully identified and marked in the CCD vasculature map.

Tune the two-photon microscope to the appropriate wavelength (920 nm for yellow fluorescent protein). Imaging is achieved by using 1.1 numerical aperture ×60 water-immersion objectives.

Obtain a low-magnification stack of fluorescently labelled neuronal processes at ×1 zoom, which serves as a more precise map for relocation of the same area at later time points in addition to the CCD image of brain vasculature. The stack is typically taken within ~200 μm below the pial surface. Additional higher magnification (×3 digital zoom) images can be taken by electronically moving the imaged area.

For re-imaging the same region, find the thinned region based on the brain vasculature map. Carefully remove the connective tissue that has re-grown on top of the thinned region using a microsurgical blade, and check the image quality with the two-photon microscope. The skull may need to be re-thinned.

Use a microsurgical blade to shave the skull carefully until a clear image can be obtained.

Find the imaged region under a fluorescence microscope. Align the region according to a ×1 zoom map under the two-photon microscope, then zoom in to ×3 to align it further.

After the image is precisely aligned with the first view, take images as previously described.

National Institutes of Health ImageJ software was used to analyse image stacks. The same dendritic segments were identified from three-dimensional stacks taken from different time points with high image quality (ratio of signal to background noise >4:1). The number and location of dendritic protrusions (protrusion length was more than one-third the dendritic shaft diameter) were identified in each view without previous knowledge of the animal’s age, the interval between views or the order of the views. The total number of spines ( n ) was pooled from dendritic segments of different animals. Filopodia were identified as long, thin structures (generally larger than twice the average spine length, ratio of head diameter to neck diameter <1.2:1 and ratio of length to neck diameter >3:1). The remaining protrusions were classified as spines. No subtypes of spines were separated. Three-dimensional stacks were used to ensure that tissue movements and rotation between imaging intervals did not influence spine identification. Spines or filopodia were considered the same between views if their positions remained the same distance from relative adjacent landmarks. Spines were considered different if they were more than 0.7 μm away from their expected positions based on the first view.

Changes in cortical volume associated with motor skill learning and EE have been well documented previously 32 – 35 . It is important to note that because we measured spine dynamics on the same dendrites in the same animals over time, our measurements of spine elimination and formation were not sensitive to changes in cortical volume.
