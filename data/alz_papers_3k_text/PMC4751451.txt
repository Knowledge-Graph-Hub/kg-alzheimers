Drosophilascreen connects nuclear transport genes to DPR pathology in c9ALS/FTD

# Abstract
Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) (c9ALS/FTD). Unconventional translation of these repeats produces dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) that may cause neurodegeneration. We performed a modifier screen in Drosophila and discovered a critical role for importins and exportins, Ran-GTP cycle regulators, nuclear pore components, and arginine methylases in mediating DPR toxicity. These findings provide evidence for an important role for nucleocytoplasmic transport in the pathogenic mechanism of c9ALS/FTD.

## Material & Methods
FLAG-tagged DPR expression constructs were designed by manually codon-optimizing the sequence, and using Mfold software 27 to control for any persistent stable secondary structures ( Fig. S6 , Table S5 ). DNA constructs were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, USA). DPR constructs were subcloned in CMV6 entry plasmids (Origene) for expression in mammalian cells. Subcloning to the pUAST-attB backbone allowed the generation of transgenic fly lines by targeted insertion into the 62E1 attP locus on the third chromosome (GenetiVision, USA). The PRMT1-EGFP construct was a kind gift of Dr. F. Fackelmayer (Laboratory for Epigenetics and Chromosome Biology, Ioannina, Greece).

Lifespan experiments were performed using, the TARGET system 28 . The tub-Gal4 or the D42-Gal4 driver was combined with a ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive Gal80 inhibitor (tub-Gal80ts). Fly crosses were grown at 18 °C and adult progeny of carrying the tub-Gal4 or the D42-Gal4 and tub-Gal80 chromosomes and the UAS-DPR responder gene were shifted to 29 °C to allow expression of the transgenes. Females were collected within 24 hr of eclosion and grouped into batches of 10 flies per food vial. Fresh food vials were provided every 2–3 days.

The GMR PR25 screening stock was crossed with the four suppressor lines and offspring was collected. 30 flies per condition were decapitated and fly heads were homogenized in 30 μl of RIPA buffer. 15 μl of homogenate was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) and air dried. Loading controls were visualized using Coomassie staining (Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk powder (Bio-Rad) in TBS-T buffer and probed with a custom rabbit PR antibody (Thermo Scientific). HRP-labeled anti rabit secondary antibody was used (Dako) and membranes were imaged using chemiluminescence (Pierce) and an Image Quant Las 4000 imaging station (GE).

HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Greiner), 4 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and non-essencial amino acids (1%). Neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells, ATCC) were cultured in high glucose DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Greiner), 4 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and non-essencial amino acids (1%). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 7% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Fly brains were dissected and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stained according standard protocols. Following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (F3165, Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG (#2368S, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-PR (custom generated antibody, Thermo Scientific), ASYM24 (07-414, Millipore), rat anti-Elav (7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). AlexaFluor 555 and AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used. Nuclei were visualized using Hoechst counterstaining (Sigma). Slides were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies).

The ASYM24 antibody was originally generated against an interrupted GR repeat (K GRGRGRGRG PPPPP RGRGRGRG ). This antigen shows strong sequence similarity with GR and hence was able to detect GR methylation, but not PR methylation. The antibody was specific for methylated residues as staining was abolished using a general methylation inhibitor Adox.

Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO confocal microscope and SIM microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Elyra S.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). SIM calculations were performed using default settings. Images were analyzed, formatted and quantified with FIJI and ImageJ software. For all experiments representative photographs are shown from multiple wells from transfections with at least two cell passages, or from multiple fly brains.

Autopsied brains of six C9orf72 carriers and two non-disease controls were obtained using informed consents and protocols that were approved by the Ethical Committee of University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital and stored in the Antwerp Biobank of the Institute Born-Bunge. Methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Clinical data are shown in Table S6 . After a fixation period of 8 to 16 weeks in 10% buffered formalin, 5 μm slices were cut from following regions: frontal cortex, hippocampus with dentate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellar cortex, medulla oblongata. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and pretreated with citric acid 0.1 M. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with anti-hnRNPA3 antibody (AV41195, Sigma) and ASYM24 antibody (07-414, Millipore). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and images were taken on an Axioskop 50 light microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD UC30 camera (Olympus Inc.).

To identify modifiers of our PR25 eye phenotype we crossed 121 RNAi lines with our screening stock. The RNAi lines were obtained from VDRC or Bloomington Drosophila stock center (USA). For each cross the collected offspring was divided by sex, and the genotypes were counted according to the balancers. The offspring ratio was determined by (expected offspring/counted offspring). For each sex we subsequently assigned an average color using following scoring scale (white = 1, yellow = 2, yellow-orange = 3, orange-yellow = 4, orange = 5, orange-red = 6, red-orange = 7, red = 8). Afterwards, each fly was individually scored for the presence of necrotic spots using following scoring scale (not affected = 0, mild = 1, medium = 2, heavy = 3, extreme = 4). We crossed each line at least two independent times. After compiling all data, two researchers assigned independently a status to each RNAi line (no effect, enhancer or suppressor) as compared to a cross of the screening stock to the RNAi w1118 background. Only whenever a gene was represented by at least two RNAi lines showing a similar effect on the phenotype, the gene was classified as an enhancer or suppressor. When shown, statistics were carried out using Prism software.

RNAi lines did not present with a degenerative eye phenotype by themselves. Two RNAi lines used had a ‘greasy’ eye phenotype reminiscent of mitochondrial eye phenotypes. These lines indeed had reported off target effects on genes involved in eye development: i.e. v105181 off target CG8085, v36103 off target CG4389. Importantly, both these hits were verified by independent RNAi lines without this ‘greasy’ eye phenotype.

We employed the FoldX force field 29 to model PR and GR in the binding pocket of transportin-1 (PDB code: 2OT8). In addition, we performed an unrestrained energy minimization using the YASARA2 force field to optimize the interactions between the PR/GR peptide and the binding pocket of transportin 1 30 . The graphical representation was generated using the Yasara program (version 13.2.21) where negatively charged residues in the binding pocket, within a distance of 5 Angstrom of the peptide, were colored in blue.
