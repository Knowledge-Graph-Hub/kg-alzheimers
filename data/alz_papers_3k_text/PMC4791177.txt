Structure of the toxic core of α-synuclein from invisible crystals

# Abstract
The protein α-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the neuron-associated aggregates seen in Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative pathologies. An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of α-synuclein. Here we report crystals of NACore having dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus invisible by optical microscopy. Thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron x-ray diffraction, these crystals have yielded an atomic resolution structure by the frontier method of Micro-Electron Diffraction. The 1.4 Å resolution structure demonstrates for the first time that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure reveals protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face β-sheets. X-ray fiber diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length α-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length α-synuclein fibril, opening opportunities for design of inhibitors of α-synuclein fibrils.

## Extended Data and Supplementary Information for: Structure of the toxic core of α-synuclein from invisible crystals
Microcrystals of SubNACore, 69 AVVTGVTAV 77 , were grown from synthetic peptide purchased from CS Bio. Crystals were grown at room temperature by hanging drop vaporization. Lyophilized peptide was dissolved in water at 2.9 mg/ml concentration in 48 mM lithium hydroxide. Peptide was mixed in a 2:1 ratio with reservoir containing 0.9 M ammonium phosphate, and 0.1M sodium acetate pH 4.6.

Nanocrystals of NACore, 68 GAVVTGVTAV 78 , were grown from synthetic peptide purchased from CS Bio. Ten batches of synthesized peptide (CSBio) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in sterile water were shaken at 37°C on a Torrey Pines orbital mixing plate at speed setting 9, overnight. The insoluble material was washed in 30% (w/v) glycerol then stored in water at room temperature before diffraction. The sample contained a mixture of fibrils and crystals.

Nanocrystals of PreNAC, 47 GVVHGVTTVA 56 , were grown from synthetic peptide purchased from InnoPep. Crystallization trials of synthesized peptide were prepared in batch. Peptide was weighed and dissolved in sterile-filtered 50mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 0.1% DMSO at a concentration of 5mg/ml. This solution was shaken at 37°C on a Torrey Pines orbital mixing plate at speed setting 9, overnight.

X-ray diffraction data from microcrystals of SubNACore were collected using synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source, Northeast Collaborative Access Team micro focus beam line 24-ID-E. The beam line was equipped with an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. Data from a single crystal were collected in 5° wedges at a wavelength of 0.9791 Å using a 5 µm beam diameter. We used data from three different sections along the needle axis. The crystals were cryo-cooled (100 K) for data collection. Data were processed and reduced using Denzo/Scalepack from the HKL suite of programs 43 .

Electron diffraction data from nanocrystals of NACore and PreNAC were collected using MicroED techniques 25 , 26 . These nanocrystals typically clump together. To break up the clumps, an approximately 100µL volume of nanocrystals was placed in a sonication bath for 30 minutes. Nanocrystals were deposited onto a Quantifoil holey-carbon EM grid in a 2–3µl drop after appropriate dilution, which optimized for crystal density on the grid. All grids were then blotted and vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI), then transferring to liquid nitrogen for storage. Frozen hydrated grids were transferred to a cryo-TEM using a Gatan 626 cryo-holder. Diffraction patterns and crystal images were collected using an FEG-equipped FEI Tecnai F20 TEM operating at 200 kV and recorded using a bottom mount TVIPS F416 CMOS camera with a sensor size of 4000 squared pixels, each 15.6 µm in size per square dimension. Diffraction patterns were recorded by operating the detector in rolling shutter mode with 2×2 pixel binning, producing a final image 2000 squared pixels in size. Individual image frames were taken with exposure times of 3–4 seconds per image, using a selected area aperture with an illuminating spot size of approximately one micron. This geometry equates to an electron dose of less than 0.1 e−/Å 2 per second. During each exposure, crystals were continuously rotated within the beam at a rate of 0.3° per second, corresponding to 1.2° wedge per frame. Diffraction data were collected from several crystals each oriented differently with respect to the rotation axis. These data sets each spanned wedges of reciprocal space ranging from 40° to 80°.

X-ray diffraction data from nanocrystals of NACore were collected using XFEL radiation at the CXI instrument (Coherent X-ray Imaging) at the Linear Coherent Light Source (LCLS)-SLAC. The photon energy of the X-ray pulses was 8.52 keV (1.45 Å). Each 40 fs pulse contained up to 6 × 10 11 photons at the sample position taking into account a beam line transmission of 60%. The diameter of the beam was approximately 1 µm. We used a concentration of approximately 25 µl of pelleted material suspended in 1 mL water. The sample was injected into the XFEL beam using a liquid jet injector and a gas dynamic virtual nozzle 44 . The micro jet width was approximately 4 µm and the flow rate was 40 µl/min. The sample caused noticeable sputtering of the liquid jet. XFEL data were processed using cctbx.xfel 45 , 46 .

Calibration of the sample to detector distance in microED was accomplished using a polycrystalline gold standard and by referencing the prominent reflections in the electron diffraction experiment with the corresponding reflections in the XFEL data. Calibration of the x/y locations of the 64-tile CSPAD detector was performed by cctbx.xfel by refining the optically measured tile positions against a thermolysin data set 45 .

To gain compatibility with conventional X-ray data processing programs, the microED diffraction images were converted from tiff or TVIPS format to the SMV crystallographic format. We used XDS to index the diffraction images 47 , and XSCALE for merging and scaling together data sets originating from different crystals. For NACore, data from four crystals were merged, while for PreNAC, data from three crystals were merged to assemble the final data sets (see Extended Data Table 1 ).

The molecular replacement solution for SubNACore was obtained using the program Phaser 48 . The search model consisted of a geometrically ideal β-strand composed of nine alanine residues. Crystallographic refinements were performed with the program Refmac 49 .

The molecular replacement solution for NACore was obtained using the program Phaser 48 . The search model consisted of the SubNACore structure determined previously. Crystallographic refinements were performed with the program Phenix 50 and Buster 51 .

The molecular replacement solution for PreNAC was obtained using the program Phaser 48 . The search model consisted of a geometrically ideal β-strand composed of six residues with sequence GVTTVA. Crystallographic refinements were performed with the program Phenix 50 and Refmac 49 .

Model building for all segments was performed using COOT 52 . Data processing and refinement statistics are reported in Extended Data Table 1 . The coordinates of the final models and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB code 4RIK for SubNACore, 4RIL for NACore, and 4ZNN for PreNAC. The structures were illustrated using Pymol 53 .

The human wild type α-syn construct was previously characterized 54 (pRK172, ampicillin, T7 promoter) with sequence: MDVFMKGLSKAKEGVVAAAEKTKQGVAEAAGKTKEGVLYVGSKTKEGVVHG VATVAEKTKEQVTNVGGAVVTGVTAVAQKTVEGAGSIAAATGFVKKDQLGKNEEGAPQEGILEDMPVDPDNEAYEMPSEEGYQDYEPEA.

Full length α-syn was purified according to published protocols 34 . The α-syn construct was transformed into E.coli expression cell line BL21 (DE3) gold (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for wild type α-syn protein expression. A single colony was incubated into 100 mL LB Miller broth (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and grown overnight at 37° C. One liter of LB (Miller) supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin in 2 L shaker flasks was incubated with 10 mL of overnight culture and grown at 37° C until the culture reached an OD600 ~0.6–0.8 as measured by a BioPhotometer UV/VIS Photometer (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and grown for 4–6 hours at 30° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,500×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellet was frozen and stored at −80° C.

The cell pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. Crude cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The clarified cell lysate was boiled and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein in the supernatant was precipitated in acid at pH 3.5 through addition of HCl by titration to protein solution on ice while stirring then centrifuged for an additional 15,000×g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After dialysis the solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe (Corning, NY 14831) before loading onto a 20 mL HiPrep Q HP 16/10 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The Q-HP column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A and protein eluted using a linear gradient to 100% in five column volumes of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1M NaCl, pH 8.0). Protein eluted at around 50–70% buffer B; peak fractions were pooled. Pooled samples were concentrated approximately tenfold using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters. Approximately 5 ml of the concentrated sample was loaded onto a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-75 HR column equilibrated with filtration buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Peak fractions were pooled from the gel filtration column and dialyzed against 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, concentrated to 3 mg/ml. These were filtered through a 0.2 µm pore size filter (Corning, NY 14831) and stored at 4 °C.

Recombinantly expressed full-length α-syn with an N-terminal acetylation was prepared and purified in the following way based on a protocol by Der-Sarkissian et al . 16 The α-syn plasmid was co-expressed with a heterodimeric protein acetylation complex from S. pombe to acetylate the N-terminus (pACYC-DUET, chloramphenicol, T7 promoter) 55 . The two vectors were co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) using media containing both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cell cultures were grown in TB media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and induced to express α-syn with 0.5 mM IPTG overnight at 25° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellet then resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cells lysed using an Emulsiflex homogenizer (Avestin). The lysate was boiled and debris removed by centrifugation. A protein fraction was also removed by precipitation at low pH on ice followed by centrifugation. The remaining supernatant was pH adjusted by titration and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The resulting protein solution was loaded onto a 5 mL Q-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted against a linear gradient of Buffer B (1M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Fractions containing α-syn were identified using SDS-PAGE, collected, concentrated and further purified by size exclusion (Sephacryl S-100 16/60, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. Purity of fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE.

Acetylated protein was characterized by LC-MS 30 , 56 . Expected average mass: 14460.1 Da for alpha-synuclein and 14502.1 for acetylated alpha-synuclein. Observed average mass: 14464.0 Da for alpha-synuclein and 14506.0 for acetylated alpha-synuclein ( Extended Data Figure 6 ). The shift of 4 Da between observed and expected average masses is due to instrumental error.

Purified α-syn in 50mM Tris, 150 mM KCl pH 7.5 was shaken at a concentration of 500 µM at 37°C in Torey Pine shaker. To form the fibrillar samples of SubNACore and NACore, lyophilized peptides were dissolved to a final concentration of 500 µM in 5 mM lithium hydroxide, 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 and 0.1 M NaCl. All samples were shaken at 37°C in a Torey Pine shaker for 72 hours. Freshly dissolved samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptides immediately prior to addition to cells for assays.

Turbidity measurements were used to compare NACore and SubNACore aggregation. Peptide samples were freshly dissolved to 1.6mM in a sample buffer with 5mM LiOH and 1% DMSO and then filtered through a PVDF filter (Millipore, 0.1µm). Measurements were performed using a black NUNC 96 well plate with 200µL of sample/well (3–4 replicates per sample). The plate was agitated at 37°C, with a 3mm rotation diameter, at 300rpm in a Varioskan microplate reader (Thermo). Absorbance readings were recorded every 3–15 minutes at 340nm.

Cytotoxicity samples were evaluated for presence of fibrils by electron microscopy. Briefly, 5 µL samples were spotted directly on freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). After 4 min incubation, grids were rinsed twice with 5-µL distilled water and stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Specimens were examined on an FEI T12 electron microscope.

Fibrils formed from purified α-syn with and without N-terminal acetylation were concentrated by centrifugation, washed, and oriented while drying between two glass capillaries. Likewise, NACore nanocrystals were also concentrated, washed with nanopure water, and allowed to orient while drying between two glass capillaries. The glass capillaries holding the aligned fibrils or nanocrystals were mounted on a brass pin for diffraction at room temperature using 1.54Å x-rays produced by a Rigaku FRE+ rotating anode generator equipped with an HTC imaging plate. All patterns were collected at a distance of 180 mm and analyzed using the Adxv software package 57 . A simulated pattern from the full length α-syn model presented in Figure 3 was obtained by calculating structure factors from the model using the sfall module from CCP4, assigning the model a unit cell of 200×4.74×200 angstroms. Cylindrical averaging of these structure factors about the fiber axis (y axis) direction produced a set of simulated fibril diffraction intensities.

Adherent PC12 cells were cultured in ATCC-formulated RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC; cat.# 30–2001) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum and plated at 10,000 per well to a final volume of 90 µl. All MTT assays were performed with Cell Titer 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation kit (MTT, Promega cat #4100). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 20h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 prior to addition of samples (Costar cat. # 3596). 10 µL of sample was added to each well containing 90 µL medium and incubated for 24h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Then, 15 µL dye solution (Promega cat #4102) was added into each well, followed by incubation for 4h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . This was followed by the addition of 100µl solubilization Solution/Stop Mix (Promega cat #4101) to each well. After 12h incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 570nm. Background absorbance was recorded at 700nm. The data was normalized with cells treated with 1% (w/v) SDS to 0% reduction, and cells treated with sample buffer to 100% reduction.

Lactose dehydrogenase assays were done using CytoTox-ONE™ Homogeneous Membrane Integrity, (Promega, cat #G7890) as per manufacturers instructions. Briefly, cells were plated in 96 well black-wall, clear bottom (Fisher Cat #07-200-588) tissue culture plates at 10,000 cells per well to a final volume of 90µL. Cells were incubated for an additional 20h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 prior to addition of samples. Next, 10µl of sample was added to each well following which the cells were incubated for another 24 hours. 100µl of reagent was added to each well and incubated for 15mins at room temperature. The addition of 50µL of stop solution stopped the reaction. Fluorescence was measured in a Spectramax M5 (Molecular Devices) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 nm and 590 nm, respectively. Data was normalized using cells treated with buffer as 0% release and 0.1% triton X-100 as 100% release.

A model for full-length α-syn A53T mutant fibrils that are involved in the early onset of PD was constructed using a section of the NACore crystal packing as a scaffold. Figure 3 illustrates the four copies of the NACore segment used for the scaffold. The crystal structure of the two inner strands was adapted with minimal changes as the analogous segments 68–78. The structure of PreNAC was matched onto the weak interface of the NACore structure. Only four of the eleven sidechains in the segment 46–56 differ from those in the NACore segment 68–78 and residues V51-V55 can be closely matched to V71-V75. Hence the model for both the homotypic interface and heterotypic interface in the full-length fiber model closely resemble those observed in the NACore structure. The regions outside these segments were adapted from the structure of the native α-syn fold, PDB ID 2KKW 58 . These segments were spliced in manually using COOT. The models were energy minimized and temperature annealed using the program CNS 59 with hydrogen bonding potential 60 . The simulated fiber diffraction pattern calculated from this model shows prominent reflections that agree with those observed in fiber diffraction patterns of NACore, α-syn, and N-acetyl α-syn ( Extended Data Table 2 ).

## Extended Data
A schematic representation of α-syn, highlighting the NAC region (residues 61–95) and within it the NACore sequence (residues 68–78). A series of bars span regions of α-syn that are of interest to this work. Among the three synuclein paralogs (α, β, and γ), the region whose sequence is unique to α-syn is shown as a blue bar (residues 72–83) that overlaps with a large portion of NACore. Segments investigated by Bodles et al . 23 are also shown. These span a variety of regions within NACore. Two of the segments we now investigate, SubNACore and NACore, are shown in this context. Only one of the segments studied by Bodles et al . is an exact match to our NACore sequence, and only this segment is both toxic and fibrillar. The sequences of α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein are shown as a reference with conserved residues in bold and the NACore sequence in red.

Difference density maps calculated after successful molecular replacement using the SubNACore search model clearly revealed the positions of the missing residues (positive F o -F c density at N and C termini corresponding to G68 and A78) and one water molecule near a threonine side chain (red circle); a second water was located during the refinement process. The blue mesh represents 2F o -F c density contoured at 1.2 σ level. The green and red mesh represent F o -F c density contoured at 3.0 and −3.0 σ, respectively. All maps were σa-weighted 61 .

The crystal structure of NACore reveals pairs of sheets as in the spines of amyloid fibrils. a , NACore’s two types of sheet-sheet interfaces: a larger interface (orange, 268 Å 2 of buried accessible surface area per chain) we call interface A, and a weaker interface (blue, 167 Å 2 ) we call interface B. The crystal is viewed along the hydrogen-bonding direction (crystal “b” dimension). The red lines outline the unit cell. b , The van der Waals packing between sheets.The sheets are related by a 2 1 screw axis denoted in black. The only gaps left by the interface are filled with water molcules which hydrogen-bond to the threonine residues (partly showing aqua spheres). The shape complementarity of both interfaces is 0.7. The viewing direction is the same as in a . c , Orthogonal view of the fibrillar assembly. The protofibril axis, coinciding with the 2 1 screw axis designated by the arrow, runs vertically between the pairs of sheets.

a , Comparison of the crystal packing for NACore (orange chain) and SubNACore (white chain). The face-to-face interactions are virtually the same for the pairs of NACore peptides in its crystal structure and the SubNACore peptides in its structure (A and B shown in gold and blue, respectively). The table below shows a pairwise the RMSD comparing the nine residues shared in common between the structures. RMSD_res is an all-atom comparison between residue pairs, while RMSD_ca compares only alpha carbon pairs. b , PreNAC (blue) is compared with NACore (orange). Five residues from each strand are shown in darker color and the RMS deviations between their alpha carbon pairs compared in the table below. Therefore the PreNAC-NACore interaction mimics weaker Interface B in the NACore structure.

Intense reflections common among the NACore and the two polymorphs of full length α-syn suggest common structural features. These features are illustrated here on the crystal packing diagrams of NACore. The (0,0,2) planes approximate the separation between sheets in interface A (orange). The (0,2,0), (−1,1,1), and (1,1,1) reflections are intense because the corresponding Bragg planes recapitulate the staggering of strands from opposing sheets. The red lines correspond to the unit cell boundaries and all planes are shown in black.

Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinantly expressed, full length α-syn, with and without N-terminal acetylation The mass profile of wild-type full length α-syn (left) is compared to that of an N-terminally acetylated form of the protein (right). The mass shift for the N-terminally acetylated form is appropriately shifted with respect to the native form of the protein (14464.0 Da for alpha-synuclein and 14506.0 for acetylated alpha-synuclein), within a margin of error of 4 Da.
