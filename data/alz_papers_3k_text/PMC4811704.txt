Hyperactive Somatostatin Interneurons Contribute to Excitotoxicity in Neurodegenerative Disorders

# Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are overlapping neurodegenerative disorders whose pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Here using TDP-43 A315T mice, an ALS and FTD model with profound cortical pathology, we demonstrated that hyperactive somatostatin interneurons disinhibited layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5-PN) and contributed to their excitotoxicity. Focal ablation of somatostatin interneurons efficiently restored normal excitability of L5-PN and alleviated neurodegeneration, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for ALS and FTD.

## Online Methods
All experiments were conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Panels on Laboratory Animal Care at The Jackson Laboratory and NIH. Transgenic mice used in this manuscript were: B6.Cg- Tg(Prnp-TARDBP*A315T)95Balo /J (010700, TDP-43 A315T or TDP ); B6.Cg- Tg (Thy1-YFPH)2Jrs /J (003782, Thy1-YFPH or YFP ); B6.Cg- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J (007914, tdTomato ); STOCK Sst tm2.1(cre)Zjh /J (013044, SstCre or Sst ); B6.Cg- Pvalb tm1.1(cre)Aibs /J (012358, PvCre or Pv ); C57BL/6- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1(HBEGF)Awai /J (007900, DTR ). Male mice were used across the studies.

Male mice age P20-22, P50-60, and P90-100 were euthanized with CO 2 and decapitated. 250 μm coronal slices were prepared with a vibratome (Leica VT1000 S and VT1200) in ice-cold cutting solution contained the following (in mM): 80 NaCl, 26 NaHCO 3 , 3.0 KCl, 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 MgCl 2 , 1.0 CaCl 2 , 20 D-glucose, and 75 sucrose, saturated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . Slices were then moved to an incubation chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) contained the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO 3 , 3.0 KCl, 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 MgCl 2 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 20 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ). Sliced were incubated first at 34°C for 30 minutes and then at room temperature (21°C) until used for recordings.

L5-PN in M1 cortex was identified by cell morphology and size, and recorded using methods as previously described 21 . Brain slices were placed in a submersion type chamber continuously perfused with ACSF saturated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at 32 – 33°C.

For IPSC recordings, the pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 120 CsCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 4.0 QX-314 (pH 7.2, 270–280 mOsm with sucrose). Miniature IPSC recordings were performed in the presence of 20 μM DNQX, 50 μM AP5, and 1 μM tetrotoxin (TTX). For recordings of evoked IPSC, a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC) was placed in L5 of M1 cortex at a fixed distance of 200 μm to the recorded cell to apply stimuli.

For EPSC recordings, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 110 Cs methylsulfate, 15 CsCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 4.0 QX-314 (pH 7.2, 270–280 mOsm with sucrose). Miniature EPSC (mEPSC) was recorded in the presence of 1 μM TTX and 100 μM picrotoxin.

Electrodes had resistances between 2 and 3.5 MΩ. The series resistance was not compensated in voltage-clamp experiments. During experiments, the series resistance was constantly monitored. Data were discarded when series resistance was >16 MΩ or change of series resistance was >15%.

For current-clamp recording, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP, 10 HEPES, and 0.5 EGTA (pH 7.2, 270–280 mOsm with sucrose). Series resistance was fully compensated using the bridge circuit of the amplifier MultiClamp 700B. Action potential threshold was estimated as the point when the slope of rising membrane potential exceeds 50 mV ms −1 .

For photo-stimulation of ChR2 and eNpHR3.0, we used a high-power light source (HXP 120V, Zeiss) controlled by AxoGraph X with TTL signal. Light was delivered onto brain slices through a band-pass filter (470-740 nm for ChR2, 605-670 nm for eNpHR3.0) via a 40×objective (NA 0.8).

For loose-seal cell-attached recordings of L5-PN, the electrodes were filled with ACSF and a loose patch of > 50 MΩ was achieved for recording with the bath application of 20 mM KCl. Recordings were performed with Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices). Experiments were conducted using AxoGraph X (AxoGraph Scientific). Data were filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Data were analyzed offline using Axograph X and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).

We crossed TDP-43 A315T ( TDP ) mice with Thy1-YFPH mice in which L5-PN are fluorescence labeled with YFP, and using their disease non-carrier fluorescent littermates as controls. We performed surgery to generate non-invasive “thin-skulled” cranial window, with a relative larger optical window (1 mm in diameter) compared to the traditional preparation procedure (200 μm in diameter) 22 , 23 . Thin-skulled cranial window requires repeatable thinning prior image acquisition due to the skull regeneration. We obtained in vivo images twice for one particular mouse. To generate a thin-skulled cranial window, experimental mice (at age of 6-weeks) were anesthetized and the cranial sutures from the bregma to lambda were exposed. Under a dissecting microscope, a high-speed micro-drill was used to thin and polish a circular region (~ 1 mm diameter) in the skull over the motor cortex to a final thickness of 15-20 μm. This circle was centered on the right hemisphere (AP: +1.2 mm, ML: +2.0 mm), to ensure that the optical window is above the motor cortex region 24 . A glass coverslip (1 mm square, #1 thickness) was fused to the thinned skull with a layer of cyanoacrylate cement, and the skull was sealed with dental cement 23 . See also Supplementary Fig. 3 .

Neuronal morphology was acquired using a custom two-photon microscope operated using custom software (ScanImage). Fine vascular patterns observed through the cranial window were used as landmarks to enable repeated imaging of the same group of neurons. We obtained the initial in vivo two-photon images of L5-PN two days after the surgery day. At the age of 9-weeks or 15-weeks we re-thinned the original cranial window and obtained the repetitive images.

Morphology and size are the two main criteria to identify “blebs”. The morphology of blebs is unique as “beads on a string”, which is very different from regular dendritic spine. We initially identified “blebs” manually based on the morphology. And the size of L5-PN dendritic blebbings was quantified, and the number of dendritic blebbings was quantified and normalized with corresponding image areas across groups. We found that the size of blebs was much bigger than that of spines. A spine is in general less than 1 μm 2 (area), while a bleb is in an average of ~ 12.8μm 2 (ranging from 2.7μm 2 to 64 μm 2 ). We also counted blebs “semi-automatically”: first set up a threshold of 3 μm 2 to automatically identify potential blebs; then manually exclude the false counts resulting from dendritic intersections. These two methods gave us similar results. We only presented the data analysis from manual identification.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg kg −1 and 10 mg kg −1 , respectively). For VGAT and Pv staining, mice were perfused with phosphate-buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brain tissues were post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and 40μm coronal sections were prepared with vibratome. VGAT and Pv immunostaining followed the standard protocols for free-floating sections. In brief, free-floating sections were incubated in blocking solution containing 4% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.3% triton X-100 in PBS, with slowly shaking for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were then treated with primary antibody in blocking solution for overnight at 4 °C and with secondary antibody in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 hours with slowly shaking. Stacked images (4μm each stack) were obtained through Leica Confocal Microscopy.

For ubiquitin staining, mice were perfused with PBS and then Bouin's solution. Brain tissues were post-fixed in Bouin's solution overnight at 4 °C and submitted blindly to the Jackson Laboratory Histology Core to be processed for paraffin embedding and ubiquitin staining. Sst immunostaining with paraffin embedded sections was similar procedure except that the sections were deparaffinized and went through the antigen retrieval step (microwave boiling for 9 minutes in 0.01M citrate, pH = 6.0).

Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-parvalbumin 25 (1:1000 dilution, p3088, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-VGAT 21 (1:2000 dilution, 131003, Synaptic Systems, Germany), rabbit anti-somatostatin 26 (1:300 dilution, sc-13099, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-NeuN 27 (1:1000 dilution, ab104224, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and mouse anti-ubiquitin 28 (1:500 dilution, 3936, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG 29 (1:300 dilution, 715-605-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG 30 (1:300 dilution, 711-605-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).

ImageJ software was used for VGAT puncta density analysis from brain slices of YFP and TDP::YFP mice with VGAT immunostaining. YFP signal was used to outline somatic area of L5-PN. VGAT puncta inside the somatic outline were quantified through Particle Analysis with parameters of 0.1 ~ 4μm in size and 0.1 ~ 1.00 in circularity. Custom script in MATLAB was used to calculate the density of VGAT puncta from brain slices of VGAT and NeuN co-immunostaining. Briefly, VGAT signals with intensity three times above the standard deviation of the image background were detected. The NeuN signal was used to define the region of interest (ROI). Only ROIs within layer 5 and with a minimal area of 300 μm 2 were identified as presumably L5-PN and pursued for further analysis. VGAT puncta for each identified ROI was quantified with a spot-detection algorithm.

For NeuN positive cell count, images of layer 5 in M1 cortex were taken with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) equipped with a 40x objective (NA 1.3), then NeuN positive cell density was calculated by dividing cell number by the image area (212.55 μm × 212.55 μm).

Adeno-associated viruses (AAV1) for Cre dependent expression of ChR2, eNpHR3.0, and eYFP were acquired from the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core: pAAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE-pA (titer 3.4 × 10 12 genome copies each milliliter), pAAV1-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP-WPRE-pA (titer 7 × 10 12 genome copies each milliliter), and pAAV1-EF1a-DIO-eYFP-WPREohGH (titer 1.8 × 10 13 genome copies each milliliter). To perform optogenetic experiments, Cre dependent ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 viruses were 1:5 diluted with saline and injected into M1 cortex region (AP: +1.5 mm, ML: +2.0 mm) of postnatal 6-7 weeks of PvCre and SstCre mice at a depth of 1.25 mm using a micropump (WPI). A total of 300 nanoliter of virus was injected over 5 min. To identify Sst and Pv interneurons in adulthood TDP mice, Cre dependent eYFP virus were 1:5 diluted with saline and injected into the M1 cortex of postnatal 6-7 weeks of PvCre , TDP::PvCre , SstCre , and TDP::SstCre mice. Two weeks after virus injection mice were sacrificed for electrophysiology experiments.

6-weeks old mice were anesthetized with 2 - 2.5 % isoflurane for diphtheria toxin (DT) injection, placed on a heating pad maintained at 37°C. 0.5 μl of DT (100 pg μl −1 in saline) was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the M1 cortex region (AP: +1.2 mm, ML: ±2.0 mm, DV: −1.6mm) at 0.1 μl min −1 , using a 10 μl syringe (Hamilton Company) connected to a microsyringe pump controller (World Precision Instruments).

Sample sizes for electrophysiological recordings and for in vivo imaging and immunostainings were estimated based on past experience and those presented in the literature. Typically, recordings of n > 10 neurons from at least 3mice each group were collected for electrophysiological studies; n > 10 images from at least 5 mice each group were collected for in vivo imaging; and n > 10 counts from each side of slices from at least 3 mice each group were collected for immunostaining.

Mice were randomly allocated to treatment condition and all data were randomly collected.

Initial electrophysiological recordings ( i.e., mIPSCs), Ubiquitin stainings, NeuN immunostainings, and VGAT immunostainings were performed in a blinded manner. All other data were collected and analyzed without the investigator blinded to genotype and treatment conditions.

All statistical comparisons were performed with two-sided tests. For comparisons between two groups, D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus test was used for normality test and the variances were calculated with Prism5.0 analysis function. If both groups displayed normal distributions and had equal variance, unpaired t-test was used; otherwise non-parametric Mann-Whitney U -test was used. For comparisons between multiple groups, Jarque-Bera test was used for normality test, and Levene's test was used for variance test. If all groups have normal distribution and equal variance, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test was used. If multiple groups exhibited different variances, Brown and Forsythe Test with post-hoc Games-Howell test were used. In these tests, data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. For experiment with photoactivation of ChR2 and eNpHR3.0, Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired t-test were used (Jarque-Bera test was used for normality test, and Levene's test was used for variance test). P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
