# Title
Microglia-specific targeting by novel capsid-modified AAV6 vectors

# Abstract
Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) have been widely used in gene therapy
applications for central nervous system diseases. Though rAAV can efficiently target
neurons and astrocytes in mouse brains, microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are
refractile to rAAV. To identify AAV capsids with microglia-specific transduction
properties, we initially screened the most commonly used serotypes, AAV1–9 and
rh10, on primary mouse microglia cultures. While these capsids were not permissive, we
then tested the microglial targeting properties of a newly characterized set of modified
rAAV6 capsid variants with high tropism for monocytes. Indeed, these newly characterized
rAAV6 capsid variants, specially a triply mutated Y731F/Y705F/T492V form, carrying a
self-complementary genome and microglia-specific promoters (F4/80 or CD68) could
efficiently and selectively transduce microglia in vitro . Delivery of these
constructs in mice brains resulted in microglia-specific expression of green fluorescent
protein, albeit at modest levels. We further show that CD68 promoter–driven
expression of the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6, using this capsid variant leads to
increased astrogliosis in the brains of wild-type mice. Our study describes the first
instance of AAV-targeted microglial gene expression leading to functional modulation of
the innate immune system in mice brains. This provides the rationale for utilizing these
unique capsid/promoter combinations for microglia-specific gene targeting for modeling or
functional studies.

## Introduction
Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) are safe and robust gene therapy vehicles for
preclinical and clinical usage. 1–3 Due to its ability to efficiently transduce neurons and
astrocytes, 4 , 5 AAV-mediated gene targeting has been used widely as disease-modifying paradigms in
preclinical models of several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, and
malignant gliomas. 6 , 7 However, rAAV-mediated genetic targeting of microglia, and in
general, cells of myeloid lineage, remains challenging. Aberrant activation of microglia,
the resident immune cells of the brain, leads to pathological conditions underlying
numerous neurologic disorders characterized by proteostasis and
neurodegeneration. 8 Given that manipulating
microglial function could result in disease modification in such intractable diseases,
characterization of rAAVs that specifically transduce microglia would allow
physiologically relevant disease modeling and development of glia-targeted
immunobiotherapies.

Several factors are critical in improving rAAV-based gene expression: increased AAV
trafficking into cells, limiting its vulnerability to intracellular clearance pathways,
and overall, higher expression of transgenes from targeted cells. These parameters can be
regulated by (i) modifying the capsid to achieve higher transduction efficiency and
limiting proteasomal degradation, (ii) using self-complementary (sc) vectors for faster
and efficient gene expression, and (iii) utilizing stronger or cell-type–specific
promoters and regulatory elements for robust gene expression from physiologically relevant
cell populations. 9–13 Incorporating these concepts, we demonstrate that a
capsid-modified rAAV6 expressing the transgene from a sc vector under the control of
microglia-specific promoters results in microglia-specific transgene expression in
vitro and in vivo . Our study highlights the potential utility of such
capsid-modified vectors in reprograming glial function in neuroinflammatory disorders.

## Results
To test whether the most widely used rAAV serotypes can transduce microglia, primary
wild-type (WT) mouse neuroglia and microglia cultures were transduced with AAV
capsids-1–9 and rh10 expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
transgene. This EGFP transgene is driven by the hybrid chicken β-actin (hCBA)
promoter from a single-stranded (ss) vector ( Table 1a ). We
did not detect any EGFP fluorescence in primary microglia cultures transduced with this
viral preparations ( Supplementary Figure S1a ), though we
detected variable levels of neuronal and astrocytic expression of EGFP in primary mixed
neuroglial cultures following transduction by these same viruses ( Supplementary Figure S1b ). This suggests that WT AAV capsids either (i)
cannot transduce microglia efficiently or (ii) are efficiently cleared via their
endoproteasomal machinery once internalized or (iii) does not have the transcriptional
machinery available for efficient gene expression in microglia. A recent study
demonstrated that using scAAV packaged in capsid-modified AAV6 can efficiently transduce
dendritic cells of monocyte lineage. 9 This
study identified several surface-exposed serine and tyrosine residues of AAV6, which
when mutated to nonphosphorylatable valine residue increased transgene expression in
dendritic cells by limiting proteasome degradation. 9 Since microglia are derived from a similar monocytic
lineage, 14 we tested whether these mutant
scAAV vectors expressing the GFP transgene under the hCBA promoter could transduce mouse
primary microglia ( Table 1b ). For these studies, we compared
the transduction efficiency of four different AAV6 capsids: WT, S663V, S663V/T492V, and
Y731F/Y705F/T492V (abbreviated as triple-mutant AAV6 or TM6) in primary mixed neuroglial
( Supplementary Figure S2 ) and primary microglial cultures
( Figure 1 ). Transduction of primary mixed neuroglial
cultures with these scCBA-GFP viruses revealed that in addition to neurons and
astrocytes being efficiently transduced, there were GFP-expressing cells with typical
microglia-like morphology in cultures transduced with the capsid-modified
AAV6 15 ( Supplementary
Figure S2 ). These cells were neither microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2;
neuronal specific cellular marker) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP;
astrocyte-specific cellular marker) positive ( Supplementary Figure
S2a , arrows), suggesting that these GFP-expressing cells could potentially be
microglia. We next tested whether these capsid variants could transduce primary murine
microglia by incubating primary microglial cultures with these rAAV6 capsid variants for
5 days ( Figure 1a ). Quantitation of direct fluorescence
( Figure 1b ) and RNA ( Figure
1c ) shows that compared with WT AAV6-transduced microglia, the mutant AAV6
capsids, in particular Y731F/Y705F/T492V triple-mutant (TM6) AAV6 capsid, shows high
levels of GFP expression. Immunocytochemical colocalization with the microglia-specific
cellular marker, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1(Iba-1), confirmed that the
GFP-expressing cells are indeed microglia ( Figure 1d ). We
were further curious whether the scCBA vector or the mutant capsid was key to increasing
microglial transduction and transgene expression. Using flow sorting of microglia
transduced with a conventional ss or the sc vector packaged in either WT AAV6 or TM6, we
found that both the vector conformations are efficiently transduced only when packaged
in TM6 capsid ( Supplementary Figure S3a , b ). This implies that the capsid variant indeed improves microglial
targeting and gene expression. Overall, our data shows that the combination of scCBA
construct in TM6 capsid resulted in the most efficient transduction efficiency ( Supplementary Figure S3a , b ). Notably,
the morphology of the scCBA-GFP-TM6 transduced microglia assumed a large, round flat
morphology with numerous microspikes all over the cell body resembling an activated
state 15 ( Figure
1d , arrows). We explored whether the TM6 capsid, by itself, or the high
levels of GFP produced in the microglia could be responsible for such activation. Using
major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII), a marker for microglial phenotypic
activation, 15 we noticed that the TM6
capsid with an empty vector alone led to increased glial MHCII compared with naive glia
or glia transduced with empty vector packaged in WT AAV6 capsid ( Figure 1e , arrows). Microglia transduced with WT AAV6 expressing scGFP also
showed increased MHCII immunoreactivity compared with empty vector transduced microglia
( Figure 1e , arrows). Next, we used the inflammatory
cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6, to further demonstrate the utility of scCBA-mediated
expression of transgene in primary microglia cells. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine
that plays a critical role in modulating neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration in aging
and neuropsychiatric diseases. 16 Primary
microglia were transduced with scCBA-IL-6 packaged in TM6 capsid and analyzed after 96
hours. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of microglial cells and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses of the culture media showed significantly
increased IL-6 RNA and protein, respectively (RNA: 98.7-fold over control; protein:
241.4-fold over control; P < 0.01, Student’s t -test).

We have demonstrated that capsid-modified TM6 can efficiently transduce microglia as
well as neurons and astrocytes. To enable selective microglia targeting, we incorporated
two different microglia-specific promoters, F4/80 and CD68, in the scTM6-GFP vector
construct ( Table 1c , d ). F4/80
antigen is an adhesion G protein–coupled receptor present on murine mononuclear
phagocyte surface, whereas CD68/macrosialin is an intracellular glycoprotein present in
lysosomes. 17 Both F4/80 and CD68 are
upregulated in macrophages and microglia following activation and are widely used as
myeloid-specific promoters in transgenic mice. 15 We tested these promoter constructs on primary mouse microglial
cultures and observed high levels of EGFP expression using the TM6 capsid variant
( Figure 2a ). We consistently observed >95% transduction
of microglial cells by either promoter in different viral batches. Both the scF4/80 and
scCD8 promoter–driven TM6 viruses resulted in robust and comparable GFP
expression in primary microglia ( Figure 2b ). To demonstrate
specificity of microglia-restricted GFP expression from scF4/80 and scCD68 constructs,
we also tested these viruses in primary mixed neuroglial cultures. Both the promoter
constructs showed extremely selective microglial expression (arrows in Iba-1
colocalization panel, Figure 2c ) with no neuronal
(arrowheads in MAP2 panel, Figure 2d ) or astrocytic
(arrowheads in GFAP panel, Figure 2c ) expression.

Next, we examined whether the TM6 capsid variant is able to transduce microglia in
mouse brains. For these experiments, we injected TM6 virus expressing scCBA-GFP,
scF4/80-GFP, and scCD68-GFP in the cerebral ventricles of WT mouse pups on neonatal day
P0 or in the hippocampus of 2- to 3-month-old WT adult female mice.
Intracerebroventricular injections of rAAV in neonatal day P0 mice lead to extensive
brain transduction and transgene expression. 4 On the other hand, hippocampal stereotaxic injections of AAVs in adult mice lead to
restricted transgene expression in the hippocampus and overlying cortex. 18 Brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to
detect cells with microglial morphology ( Figure 3a ) and
confirmed by immunofluorescence showing colocalization with Iba-1 (microglia-specific
marker) ( Figure 3b ). Injection of scCBA-GFP in neonatal P0
pups resulted in widespread GFP expression in the forebrain after 15- and 30-day
postinjection ( Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S4 ). The majority of cells transduced were neurons
( Figure 3a , arrowhead and Supplementary
Figure S4b ), though few microglia expressing GFP were also seen ( Supplementary Figure S4c ). GFP was detected from neurons as well
as microglia in adult mice injected in the hippocampus with scCBA-GFP and analyzed after
15 days ( Figure 3 , arrow). Injection of scF4/80-GFP and
scCD68-GFP in neonatal pups resulted in microglia-restricted expression of GFP when
analyzed after 15 and 30 days ( Figure 3a , b , arrow). F4/80 and CD68 promoter–driven GFP–expressing
microglia were observed to be clustered around the ventricles and overlying cortex in
the P0-injected cohorts (~50–60 microglia per 10-µm cryosection). In the
hippocampus-injected adult cohort, few microglia-expressing GFP from these
promoter-specific constructs were noticed in the hippocampal area or white matter tracts
overlaying the hippocampus ( Figure 3a , b , arrow). Quantitative analysis of cortical microglia shows that P0
delivery of scCBA and scF4/80 promoter constructs result in higher transduction rates
compared with the scCD68 promoter construct ( Figure 3c ),
suggesting that overall CBA and F4/80 promoters are more efficient than CD68 under these
conditions. Using the scCBA promoter resulted in transduction of both microglia (Iba+
GFP+) and non-microglia cells (Iba− GFP+), and under certain conditions, such as
P0 →30 days and adult delivery paradigms, most of the AAV-transduced cells were
not microglia ( Figure 3c ). On the other hand, both scF4/80
and scCD68 constructs resulted in GFP expression from exclusively Iba+ microglia cells,
showing that these promoters drive microglia-selective gene expression in vivo ( Figure 3c ). Since we observed MHCII upregulation in
primary microglia transduced with these constructs, we tested for MHCII immunoreactivity
in scCBA-TM6 injected brains to explore whether there are any similar changes in
microglial activation following viral delivery. Overall, MHCII immunostaining was rarely
observed in these mice brains, including naive and injected brains; we did not observe
any MHCII immunostaining in TM6 transduced microglia in vivo ( Supplementary Figure S5 ).

In order to test whether TM6-targeted microglia–specific transgene expression
can be used to alter immune activation state in the brain, we injected scCD68-IL6 in
neonatal WT mice. In primary microglia culture, transduction with scCD68-IL6 results in
increased IL-6 levels (RNA: 214.99-fold over control; protein:
250.82 ± 5.1 pg/ml; P < 0.01, Student’s t -test). Neonatal day P0 mouse pups were injected in the cerebral ventricles
with scCD68-IL6 vector and analyzed after 15 days. This led to increased IL-6 levels in
the brain (RNA: 7.5× over uninjected mice; protein: 121% over uninjected mice; P = 0.05, Student’s t -test), increased microgliosis (lectin
staining, Figure 4a ), and increased astrocytosis (GFAP
immunostaining, Figure 4b ). The astrogliosis was restricted
to the hippocampus, ventricles, and white matter tract (corpus callosum) overlying the
hippocampus, whereas the cortex remained unaffected. This is consistent with P0
injections targeting the area around the cerebral ventricles. 4 GFAP protein levels were significantly increased in IL-6
expressing mice brains, demonstrating that TM6-scCD68–mediated IL-6 expression
leads to substantial immune modification in vivo ( Figure
4c ).

## Discussion
rAAVs are being increasingly used as ideal gene therapy vehicles in preclinical studies
and clinical trials in central nervous system diseases. 2 Multiple rAAV serotypes lead to efficient gene expression from
neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes when injected into the brain, spinal cord, tail
vein, or even hindlimb muscles of rodents (reviewed in ref. 2 ) but robust microglial gene targeting has not been reported. Inefficient
targeting of microglia is a major roadblock in devising accurate models of microgliopathy
and design of therapies against neurologic diseases marked by microglial activation. As
more AAV serotypes are being naturally isolated or invented by in vitro rational
design in recent years, 19 it is now possible to
test these newer variants for microglia-restricted transduction properties. Here, we show
that (i) the capsid-mutated TM6 serotype with a sc vector sequence efficiently transduces
neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in primary murine cultures and (ii) using F4/80 and
CD68 promoters enables selective targeting of microglia by TM6 viruses in vitro and in vivo . This is the first study that demonstrates unique microglia tropism
by TM6 and related capsid variants derived from AAV6. Our study establishes new technology
platforms for microglial targeting by novel capsid-optimized rAAVs and opens up the
possibility of designing more improved rAAVs with specific microglial biotransduction
properties.

In spite of the advent of new generations of engineered AAVs with improved stability and
transduction properties, there have been only two previous reports that have shown some
degree of microglial targeting. 20 , 21 The first of these reports showed that WT AAV2 can transduce
microglia in culture, albeit at low kinetic rates compared with neurons. 21 The other report demonstrated selective microglial
targeting by AAV5 serotype using the F4/80 and to a lesser extent, the CD68
promoter. 20 However, we were unable to
detect microglial transduction by either rAAV2 or rAAV5 in primary microglial cultures in
this study. In addition, following intracerebroventricular delivery in neonatal mice, we
have shown earlier that though both rAAV2 and rAAV5 can efficiently transduce neurons and
astrocytes, they do not transduce microglia in the brain. 4

Transgenic approaches using myeloid-specific promoters have been widely used to
genetically model immune diseases or to test therapies designed against immunological
diseases. 22 Since most of these promoters
are active in all cells of hematopoietic lineage, exclusive targeting microglia by
transgenic technology is challenging. In addition, presently available viral and nonviral
methodologies display widely variable transduction efficiency for cells of myeloid
lineage. Standard transfection methods achieve modest efficiency (~20%) of transgene
expression in vitro , 23 though
HIV-1–derived lentivirus–mediated gene delivery can, however, achieve high
transduction efficiency in vitro and in vivo . 1 However, lentiviruses can potentially engage with the immune
system, and because of their propensity to integrate randomly into the chromosome, this
otherwise powerful gene targeting technology can result in variable gene expression in
preclinical models and adverse outcomes such as leukemia in human patients. 24 On the other hand, AAV, especially the capsid variants,
display widespread tolerability and relatively low immunogenicity. 2 Using a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, Martino et al . 25 showed
that by minimizing proteasomal trafficking in antigen-presenting cells, the triple capsid
variant AAV2 (Y444F/Y500F/Y730F) potentially has lower antigen-presenting capabilities
that, in turn, can prevent induction of innate immune responses and cytotoxicity. Similar
studies have confirmed that though there is an initial and transient induction of immune
response following virus transduction into monocytes, capsid-modified AAVs do not induce
phenotypic alterations in the transduced cells. 26 , 27 More importantly, AAV-driven
hepatic expression of transgenes can even drive immune tolerance by inducing hepatic Treg
production. 28–30 Given
such data, we expect that the triple-mutant AAVs used in our study would potentially share
similar nonpathogenic and nonimmunogenic properties. Such a rAAV platform offers an
attractive transgenesis paradigm for microglial targeting applications in
neurodegenerative disorders without confounding side effects of peripheral immune
alterations.

In our study, we have used three relatively novel strategies to ensure increased
transgene expression in the microglia: the use of surface tyrosine–mutated capsids,
sc vectors, and microglia-specific promoters. Recent studies exploring different aspects
of molecular trafficking of AAVs have shown that phosphorylation of surface-exposed serine
and tyrosine residues on AAV capsids results in rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation of AAVs. 11 , 31 In addition, oxidation of surface tyrosine can impair
externalization of the N-terminal portion of the capsid proteins. 32 Mutation of surface-exposed serine and tyrosines to phenylalanines
can reduce post-translational modifications of the capsid proteins and thereby reduce
viral clearance by intracellular pathways. 33 This can potentially improve nuclear transport of the viral particles and increase
transgene expression. 27 For example, S663V/T492V
variant of AAV6 was shown to be 5× more efficient in transducing mouse monocyte
derived dendritic cells than WT AAV6. 9 Similar
results were observed for other AAV capsid serotypes—a triple-mutant
AAV2—Y444F/Y500F/Y730F vector led to robust higher levels of transgene expression in vitro 34 and in
vivo . 33 Intriguingly, several reports
have demonstrated that the proteasomal system appears to be more active in glia than in
neurons, 35 which may partially explain the
inability of native WT capsids to result in high levels of microglial gene expression in
our study.

A second, rate-limiting step in rAAV-mediated gene expression is the conversion of the
AAV genome into double-stranded DNA, once the viral genome enters the
nucleus. 13 This can be circumvented by using
a scAAV genome that consists of inverted repeats arranged in a way that facilitates the
folding of the AAV genome into a double-stranded form without the requirement for DNA
synthesis. Though packaging constraints impose size limits on the genes that can be
delivered using this approach, scAAV vectors typically result in 20× to 100×
more expression than conventional ss AAV vectors. 36

Using either the F4/80 or CD68 promoter in combination with the surface-mutated AAV6
capsid, we could demonstrate >95% transduction of primary microglial cells in culture
and selective microglial transduction in vivo . Whereas we could achieve high
transduction rates with TM6 capsids in culture, the biodistribution of transduced
microglia was restricted in vivo . Since microglial turnover rates in the normal
brain are slow (in order of months or more 8 , 37 ), it is difficult to explain the modest levels of
microglial transduction in vivo compared with the excellent transduction
properties of the TM6 viruses in vitro . One factor may be that the relative
strength of the promoters used (F4/80 and CD68) is inherently low in the mouse brain and
that our current detection methods are unable to detect such low levels of transgene
expression. Though F4/80 and CD68 promoters are commonly used promoters, 17 recent RNA-sequencing studies have shown that neither
of these promoters are highly active in the resting central nervous system. 38 This may have contributed to the modest levels of
transgene expression following scGFP and scCD68-IL6 transduction of mouse brains in our
studies, compared with our earlier observations using hCBA promoter. 4 , 18 Future manipulations of
mouse microglia using other highly active microglial promoters could enhance transgene
expression following transduction by capsid-modified rAAV6. In addition, understanding the
exact mechanism that allows for high microglial transduction by the capsid variants and
potential pathologic effects of long-term transgene expression affecting microglial
homeostasis need to be characterized further in vivo . In summary, our studies
will pave the way toward the development of improved engineered AAV vectors for selective
microglial targeting as a means to explore microglial function in health and disease.

## Materials and Methods
A pAAV vector containing a hybrid cytomegalovirus enhancer/CBA promoter, a CBA intron
(first intron of CBA gene plus the splice acceptor of the rabbit β-globin
gene), 39 woodchuck hepatitis virus
post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and the EGFP transgene was used as a
template for further subcloning ( Table 1 ). This vector was
modified by swapping in a modified SV40 late 16S rRNA intron in place of the CBA intron
and also deleting the terminal resolution site sequence from the inverted terminal
repeats to produce a mutant inverted terminal repeats, such that the viral Rep protein
cannot generate the ss DNA nick. This resulted in a double-stranded sc pAAV
vector. 40 To facilitate subcloning in this
sc vector, a multiple cloning site was introduced 41 , and the SV40 intron was replaced by the minute virus of mouse
intron (MVMi). 36 This scAAV vector expressing
humanized GFP formed the template for expression vectors driven by the F4/80 or CD68
promoters. The F4/80 promoter was released from pAAV-F4/80-RFP (kind gift from EF
Terwilliger 20 ) by XbaI (blunt ended) and
SalI digestions and used to replace the hCBA promoter region of the scAAV vector
digested with KpnI (blunt ended) and SalI to produce the scF4/80-GFP construct. To
produce the scCD68-GFP construct, the hCBA promoter was released from the scAAV vector
and the free ends modified by PCR to yield 5′-Kpn I and 3′-Sal I sites,
into which the CD68 promoter region was ligated from pAAV-CD68-RFP (kind gift from EF
Terwilliger 20 ). Mouse IL-6
cDNA 18 was swapped with the GFP sequence
in the scCD68-GFP vector using EcoRV and NheI restriction sites producing scCD68-IL6.
The scAAV plasmids were cotransfected along with rep and cap plasmids (modified AAV6
capsid plasmids encoding S663V, S663V/T492V, and Y731F/Y705F/T492V mutations George
Aslanidi and Arun Srivastava, University of Florida) into HEK293T cells. rAAV was
prepared under sterile endotoxin–free conditions by methods described earlier
using cell stacks. 42 Briefly, 180 µg of
endotoxin-free vector DNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to transfect HEK293T cells in
two-chambered cell stack (Costar Product #3269, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
and purified using iodixanol gradient into a final volume of ~200-µl sterile
endotoxin–free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. Genomic titers were
determined by quantitative PCR as described earlier 4 , 43 ( Table
2 ). The following custom primers corresponding to GFP was used: forward
primer, 5′GAAACATTCTCGGCCACAAG; reverse primer, 5′TTGTCGGCCATGATGTACAC.
For IL-6 quantitative reverse transcription–PCR, the following probe/primer
combinations were used: Probe #6 (catalog # 04685032001, Roche Universal Probe Library,
Roche, Indianapolis IN), forward primer, 5′GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA; reverse
primer, 5′CCAGGTAGCTATGGTACTCCAGAA. Quantitative PCR for bGH was carried out
using custom TaqMan probe (5′TGCCAGCCATCTGTTGTTTGCC) and primers (forward:
5′CCTCGACTGTGCCTTCTAG and reverse: 5′TGCGATGCAATTTCCTCAT). All the primers
were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The purity of the AAVs
were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for
detecting bands corresponding to the viral structural proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3.
Typical genomic titers of purified viruses are presented in Table
2 .

All animal husbandry procedures were performed following approval by University of
Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary neuroglia and microglia
cultures were prepared by isolating mouse cortices from B6/C3H newborn mice (neonatal
day P0–P2) as described earlier. 18 Mixed neuroglia were maintained in Neurobasal media (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 0.02% NeuroCult SM1 (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada), 0.5 mmol/l GlutaMax (GIBCO, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 0.5%
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), and 0.01% Pen-strep
(GIBCO, Life Technologies). Neuroglial cultures were plated in CC2 Lab Tek II 8-chamber
slide (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The mixed microglia–astrocyte cultures
were maintained in Tripleflasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 200 ml of 5%
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium–containing serum. After 10–14
days of incubation, the flasks were shaken for 30 minutes at 37°C at 150 rpm
to dislodge the microglia from the astrocyte layer and plated in Nunc Lab-Tek II CC2
chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Microglia or neuronal cultures were
transduced with purified rAAVs (1 × 10 8 vector genomes
total for sc and ss viruses, Table 2 ) for 5 days. Direct
fluorescence pictures were captured using Evos FL Cell Imaging System (Life
Technologies, New York, NY) and analyzed using ImageJ 1.47b (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Intracerebroventricular injections of rAAVs were carried out in neonatal mice
(B6/C3HNhsd, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) on day P0 as described earlier. 4 Two-month-old naive B6/C3HNhsd mice were also
stereotaxically in the hippocampus with rAAV as described earlier. 18 In both cases, purified
2 × 10 8 viruses (2 µl in PBS) were administered
bilaterally. After 15 or 30 days, mice were euthanized by transcardiac perfusion, brains
harvested, and fixed in 10% normal buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then
transferred to 30% sucrose solution in PBS for cryosectioning.

Total RNA from mouse brain was purified using Trizol and RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Gaithersburg, MD) and reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen, New York,
NY). Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR was performed using custom
primer/probe mix. Probes (from Roche Universal Probe library: #6 (cat. no. 04685032001)
for IL-6) were labeled at 5′ end with Fluorescein (FAM) and at the 3′ end
with dark blue quencher. Target-specific primer sequences were ordered from Integrated
DNA Technologies (IL-6: forward primer: GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA; reverse primer:
CCAGGTAGCTATGGTACTCCAGAA). The reaction utilized the SSoFast EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and used the following steps: initial denaturation cycle 95 °C/30
seconds, followed by 39 amplification cycle of 95 °C/5 seconds and 60 °C/5
seconds.

For immunocytochemical analysis, fixed primary cultures were incubated in primary
antibody overnight at 4 °C (Iba-1 (1:1,000; Abcam, San Francisco, CA), MHCII
(1:500; Abcam), GFAP-Cy3 (1:1,000; Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO), MAP2 (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), cd11b (1:500; Novus, Littleton, CO), MHCII (IBL-5/22)
(1:250; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), and EGFP (1:1,000; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)).
Cells were washed three times with PBS, and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody
(Life Technologies) was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Nuclei were
stained with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Southern Biotech, Birmingham,
AL).

Formalin-fixed, sucrose-saturated mouse brains were frozen in optimum cutting
temperature compound (Tissue Tek, Torrance, CA) and sliced into 10-µm coronal
sections. Sections were blocked in 2.5% horse serum (Vector Biolabs, Burlingame, CA) for
1 hour at room temperature and incubated in primary antibody to Iba-1 (1:1,000; Abcam),
GFAP-Cy3 (1:1,000; Sigma–Aldrich), and EGFP (1:1,000; Life Technologies)
overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with either
fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Life Technologies) or ImmPress
reagents (Vector Labs) for visualization with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
colorimetric assays. DyLight-594 labeled Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato)
lectin (10 µg/ml, Vector Biolabs) staining was carried out using
manufacturer’s instructions. Images were captured using Olympus Microscope or
Aperio whole-slide imager. Brightness and contrast alterations were applied identically
using Photoshop CS5.

GFP-immunopositive microglia were manually counted to determine the extent of
transduction in vivo . For each cohort, at least five independent fields of view
(20× field of view, Olympus DP71 microscope) from the cortex of injected mice were
counted, averaged over all the mice in the cohort ( n = 3), and presented. Iba-1
immunostaining was used to determine the total microglia count in the same sections
using double immunofluorescence staining.

For immunoblotting, anti-GFAP (1:1,000; Sigma–Aldrich), anti-EGFP (1:1,000; Life
Technologies, NY), anti-β-actin (1:1,000, Sigma–Aldrich), and
anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:2,000; Abcam) were used as primary
antibodies and signals detected by fluorescent secondary antibodies using Li-Cor
Biosciences Odyssey system (Lincoln, NB).

Primary microglia were transduced in a six-well plate with viruses for 5 days, fixed in
10% normal buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) containing
0.05 M sucrose, washed in sterile PBS, and collected using a cell scraper. Fixed
microglia were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin
(Sigma–Aldrich). Flow sorting was carried out using BD Accuri C6 Cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for
Biotechnology Research.
