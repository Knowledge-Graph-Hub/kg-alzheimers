# Title
A multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for longitudinal image
analysis: Application to amyloid imaging

# Abstract
It is important to characterize the temporal trajectories of
disease-related biomarkers in order to monitor progression and identify
potential points of intervention. These are especially important for
neurodegenerative diseases, as therapeutic intervention is most likely to be
effective in the preclinical disease stages prior to significant neuronal
damage. Neuroimaging allows for the measurement of structural, functional, and
metabolic integrity of the brain at the level of voxels, whose volumes are on
the order of mm 3 . These voxelwise measurements provide a rich
collection of disease indicators. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies enable the
analysis of changes in these voxelwise measures. However, commonly used
longitudinal analysis approaches, such as linear mixed effects models, do not
account for the fact that individuals enter a study at various disease stages
and progress at different rates, and generally consider each voxelwise measure
independently. We propose a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for
estimating the trajectories of voxelwise neuroimaging biomarkers from
longitudinal data that accounts for such differences across individuals. The
method involves the prediction of a progression score for each visit based on a
collective analysis of voxelwise biomarker data within an
expectation-maximization framework that efficiently handles large amounts of
measurements and variable number of visits per individual, and accounts for
spatial correlations among voxels. This score allows individuals with similar
progressions to be aligned and analyzed together, which enables the construction
of a trajectory of brain changes as a function of an underlying progression or
disease stage. We apply our method to studying cortical β-amyloid
deposition, a hallmark of preclinical Alzheimer's disease, as measured using
positron emission tomography. Results on 104 individuals with a total of 300
visits suggest that precuneus is the earliest cortical region to accumulate
amyloid, closely followed by the cingulate and frontal cortices, then by the
lateral parietal cortex. The extracted progression scores reveal a pattern
similar to mean cortical distribution volume ratio (DVR), an index of global
brain amyloid levels. The proposed method can be applied to other types of
longitudinal imaging data, including metabolism, blood flow, tau, and structural
imaging-derived measures, to extract individualized summary scores indicating
disease progression and to provide voxelwise trajectories that can be compared
between brain regions.

## 1. Introduction
It is important to characterize the temporal trajectories of disease-related
biomarkers in order to monitor progression and to identify potential points of
intervention. Such a characterization is especially important for neurodegenerative
diseases, as therapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the
preclinical disease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. For example, in
Alzheimer's disease, brain changes evident in structural, functional, and metabolic
imaging may occur more than a decade before the onset of cognitive symptoms ( Bateman et al., 2012 ), with cortical
amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation being one of the earliest changes ( Jack et al., 2013 ; Sperling et al., 2014a ; Villemagne et al., 2013 ). Such brain changes can be measured using
neuroimaging techniques and can be tracked over time at the individual level via
longitudinal studies.

Given the focus on preventing and delaying the onset of incurable
neurodegenerative diseases, the emphasis of clinical trials has shifted to studying
clinically normal individuals with positive biomarkers, for example those exhibiting
brain amyloid in the case of AD, in order to identify early intervention
opportunities in the preclinical stages of disease ( Sperling et al., 2014b ). It is important to determine the temporal
trajectories of hypothesized biomarkers in the early disease stages in order to
better understand their associations with disease progression. Current neuroimaging
methods allow for the characterization of the brain at the mm 3 level,
generating hundreds of thousands of measurements that can be used as potential
biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the temporal trajectories of
these voxelwise measurements can provide clues into disease mechanisms by
identifying the earliest and fastest changing brain regions.

Changes in voxelwise neuroimaging measurements over time are commonly studied
using linear mixed effects models ( Bernal-Rusiel et
al., 2012 , 2013 ; Ziegler et al., 2015 ). Univariate linear mixed
effects models use time or age to characterize changes in a single imaging measure.
However, time or age may not be the appropriate metric for measuring disease
progression due to variability across individuals. While covariates can be included
in linear mixed effects models to account for this variability, choosing the correct
set of covariates is difficult and covariates generally have a more complicated
association with disease progression than the assumed linear relationship of linear
mixed effects models. Instead, this variability can be accounted for by aligning
individuals in time based on their longitudinal biomarker profiles within a
multivariate framework. This is the premise of the Disease Progression Score method,
which has been applied to studying changes in cognitive and biological markers
related to Alzheimer's disease ( Jedynak et al.,
2012 , 2014 ; Bilgel et al., 2014 ). It is assumed that there is an underlying
progression score (PS) for each subject visit that is an affine transform of the
subject's age, and given this PS, it is possible to place biomarker measurements
across a group of subjects onto a common timeline. The affine transformation of age
removes across-subject variability in baseline biomarker measures as well as in
their rates of longitudinal progression. Each biomarker is associated with a
parametric trajectory as a function of PS, whose parameters are estimated along with
the PS for each subject. This allows one to “stitch” data across
subjects to obtain temporal biomarker trajectories that fit an underlying model
( Fig. 1 ).

Previous approaches have used certain cognitive measures, such as ADAS-Cog
( Caroli and Frisoni, 2010 ; Yang et al., 2011 ), MMSE ( Doody et al., 2010 ) or CDR-SB ( Delor et al., 2013 ) as a surrogate for disease progression to delineate
the trajectories of other AD-related cognitive measurements. These methods operate
with the assumption that disease progression is reflected by a single cognitive
measurement rather than a profile of multiple measurements, and therefore are
inherently limited in their characterization of disease evolution. Younes et al. (2014) fitted a piecewise linear
model to longitudinal data assuming that each biomarker becomes abnormal a certain
number of years before clinical diagnosis, and this duration was estimated for each
biomarker to yield longitudinal trajectories as a function of time to diagnosis. A
quantile regression approach was employed by Schmidt-Richberg et al. (2015) to align a sample of cognitively normals
and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) with a sample of MCI and AD, and then to
estimate biomarker trajectories. These approaches assume that all individuals are on
a path to disease and require knowledge of clinical diagnosis. Therefore, they are
not suitable for studying the earliest changes in individuals who have not converted
to a clinical diagnosis. Donohue et al.
(2014) applied a self-modeling regression model within a multivariate
framework to characterize the longitudinal trajectories of a set of cognitive, CSF,
and neuroimaging-based biomarkers. This approach allows for across-subject
variability only in the age of onset, not in progression speed. Models incorporating
fixed effects as well as individual-level random effects have been proposed to study
ADAS-Cog ( Ito et al., 2011 ; Schiratti et al., 2015b ) and regional cortical
atrophy ( Schiratti et al., 2015b ), and Schulam et al. (2015) used a spline model that
incorporates longitudinal clustering and modeling of individual-level effects to
study trajectories of scleroderma markers. These mixed effects models take into
consideration each measure separately rather than using them within a unifying
framework. Others have used event-based probabilistic frameworks to determine the
ordering of changes in longitudinal biomarker measures as well as the appropriate
thresholds for separating normal from abnormal measures ( Fonteijn et al., 2012 ; Young et
al., 2014 ). These methods characterize longitudinal biomarker
trajectories in a discrete framework rather than a continuous one. Schiratti et al. (2015a) proposed an extension
to their earlier approach to model multiple measures together. Biomarker
trajectories are assumed to be identical except for a shift along the disease
timeline, and this assumption prevents hypothesis testing regarding rate of change
across biomarkers. Furthermore, biomarkers are assumed to be conditionally
independent given the subject-level random effects, but this assumption is not
realistic when biomarkers are voxel-based neuroimaging measurements.

Here, we adapt the disease progression score principle to studying
longitudinal neuroimaging data by making substantial innovations to the progression
score model and parameter estimation procedure. First, voxelwise imaging measures
constitute the biomarkers in the model, and are analyzed together in a multivariate
framework. Studying progression at the voxel level rather than using region of
interest (ROI)-based measures allows for the discovery of patterns that may not be
confined within any given ROI. Second, since voxelwise imaging measures have an
underlying spatial correlation, we incorporate the modeling of the spatial
correlations among the biomarker error terms. Modeling spatial correlations makes
the inference of the subject-specific progression scores less susceptible to the
inherent correlations among the voxels. Third, we incorporate a bivariate normal
prior on the subject-specific variables that define the relationship between age and
PS. The prior allows a better modeling of the variance within individuals and
enables the incorporation of individuals with a single visit into the model fitting
procedure. Fourth, instead of using an alternating least-squares approach for
parameter estimation as presented by Jedynak et al.
(2012) , we formulate the model fitting as an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm, which guarantees convergence to a local maximum and allows for an
efficient model fitting framework for a large number of biomarkers. Finally, we
present a statistical framework for comparing the onset and rate of progression
across different regions. This paper extends our previous approach for analyzing
longitudinal voxelwise imaging measures using the progression score framework by
incorporating a prior on the subject-specific variables, presenting a hypothesis
testing framework for determining biomarker ordering, and performing an extensive
validation of the method ( Bilgel et al.,
2015c ).

We first show using simulated data that the model parameters are estimated
accurately and that modeling spatial correlations improves parameter estimation. We
then apply the method to distribution volume ratio (DVR) images derived from
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging, which show the distribution of cerebral
fibrillar amyloid. Models fitted using data for 104 participants with a total of 300
PiB-PET visits reveal that the precuneus and frontal cortex show the greatest
longitudinal increases in fibrillar amyloid, with smaller increases in lateral
temporal and temporoparietal regions, and minimal increases in the occipital cortex
and the sensorimotor strip. Our results suggest that the precuneus is the earliest
cortical region to accumulate amyloid. The results are consistent across the two
hemispheres, and the estimated PS agrees with a widely used PET-based global index
of brain amyloid known as mean cortical DVR. The presented method can be applied to
other types of longitudinal imaging data to understand voxelwise trajectories and to
quantify each individual scan against the estimated progression pattern.

## 2. Method
Our goal is to characterize the progression of disease or an underlying
process as measured using a collection of relevant biomarkers. Disease or
process stage, as indicated by a progression score (PS), s, is intrinsically
related to time t , measured as the age of a subject. Since
individuals differ in their onset and rate of progression, the relationship
between s and t varies across individuals. We
model the progression s as a linear function of time t for each individual and allow for the prediction of
separate slopes and intercepts to account for this variability across
individuals.

Generally, there is a particular presentation of symptoms and biomarker
measurements at a given progression stage. Furthermore, as the disease or
process progresses, there is a particular temporal progression of the
biomarkers. In this work, we consider voxelwise PET measures as biomarkers and
model the temporal trajectory of each biomarker, or voxel, as a linear function
of the progression s . Considering voxelwise neuroimaging
measures as biomarkers may appear unusual; however, these measures fit the NIH
definition of a biomarker: “a characteristic that is objectively measured
and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic
processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention”
( Biomarkers Definitions Working Group,
2001 ). As illustrated in Figure
1 , PS aligns longitudinal biomarker measures better than age since it
accounts for differences across individuals in rates as well as baseline levels
of progression. After this alignment in time, the estimated biomarker
trajectories can be compared on the common PS scale.

In the following subsections, we describe the progression score model in
detail.

The progression score s ij for subject i at visit j is assumed to be an
affine transformation of the subject's age t ij : (1) s i j = α i t i j + β i = q i j T u i , where q i j = [ t i j 1 ] , and u i = [ α i β i ] . The subject-specific variables,
α i and
β i contained in the vector u i , are assumed to follow a
bivariate normal distribution, i.e., u i ~ N 2 ( m , V ) , which are independent and identically
distributed across subjects. This model accounts for differences between
subjects in the rate of progression via α, and in the baseline levels
of disease progression via β.

The prior covariance V is modeled as a 2×2
unstructured covariance matrix. Log-Cholesky parametrization of V , given by ν , ensures that V ≡ V ( ν )
is positive definite ( Pinheiro and Bates,
1996 ). Let U = [ U 11 U 12 0 U 22 ] be an upper triangular matrix such that V = U T U . If the diagonal
elements of U are constrained to be positive, then this
Cholesky decomposition is unique. To ensure that the diagonal elements of U are positive in an unconstrained optimization
framework, we use the natural logarithm of the diagonal elements of U as parameters. We then vectorize the upper triangular
elements (including the diagonal) of U to obtain the
parameter vector ν = [log U 11 U 12 log U 22 ] T , which
uniquely parameterizes V and ensures its positive
definiteness.

The collection of K biomarker measurements form the K × 1 vector y ij for subject i at visit j . Longitudinal
trajectories associated with these biomarkers are assumed to be linear and
parameterized by K × 1 vectors a and b : (2) y i j = a s i j + b + ϵ i j . Here, a = [ a 1 , a 2 , …, a K ] T , b = [ b 1 , b 2 , …, b K ] T , and ϵ i j ~ N K ( 0 , R ) is the observation noise. ϵ ij are assumed to be
independent and identically distributed across subjects and visits.

The matrix R is assumed to have the form R = Λ C Λ, where Λ
is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements λ and C is a correlation matrix parameterized by ρ . This parameterization guarantees that R is a positive definite matrix ( Galecki and Burzykowski, 2013 ). For ease of notation,
we let Λ ≡ Λ( λ ), C ≡ C ( ρ ), and R ≡ R ( λ , ρ ).

When the biomarkers under consideration have a spatial organization,
i.e., if they are voxelwise measurements from medical images, then the
correlation matrix C can be described as a function of the
spatial distance d ≡ d ( k , k ′)
between pairs of voxels indexed by k and k ′ as well as the spatial correlation parameter ρ . Possible univariate parameterizations (i.e., ρ = ρ ∈ R ) of C are presented in Table 1 . All of these spatial
correlation functions ensure that C is a valid correlation
matrix ( Galecki and Burzykowski,
2013 ).

The overall model, diagrammatically summarized using plate notation
in Fig. 2 , is described by the
following equations: (3) s i j = q i j T u i (4) y i j = a s i j + b + ϵ i j (5) u i ∼ N 2 ( m , V ( ν ) ) (6) ϵ i j ∼ N K ( 0 , R ( λ , ρ ) ) .

While this model is a mixed effects model since it incorporates the
fixed effects a , b as well as the individual-level
random effects u i , and is nonlinear
in the parameters, it departs from the form of the nonlinear mixed effects
model described by Lindstrom and Bates
(1990) . Therefore, instead of pursuing a restricted maximum
likelihood approach, we use an expectation-maximization (EM) approach, as
described below.

Let θ be the collection of model parameters m , ν , a , b , λ , ρ . The complete
log-likelihood for the model is (7) ℓ ( y , u ; θ ) = ∑ i ℓ ( y i , u i ; θ ) (8) = ∑ i log f ( y i ∣ u i ; θ ) + log f ( u i ; θ ) (9) = − 1 2 ∑ i , j log ∣ 2 π R ∣ − 1 2 ∑ i , j ( y i j − Z i j u i − b ) T R − 1 ( y i j − Z i j u i − b ) − 1 2 ∑ i log ∣ 2 π V ∣ − 1 2 ∑ i ( u i − m ) T V − 1 ( u i − m ) , where Z i j = aq i j T . y i is a vector of all biomarker
measures stacked across all visits of individual i , and y ij is a vector of all
biomarker measures for individual i at visit j . Given n individuals, we use the
summation notation Σ i,j as a shorthand
for ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 v i , where v i is
the number of visits for individual i .

Since the marginal likelihood f ( y ;
θ) involves an integral over all possible values of u i , maximizing it directly
is difficult. Therefore, we use the expectation-maximization (EM) approach,
where we consider the subject-specific variables
{ u i } as hidden. EM allows
us to reformulate the maximization problem in terms of the complete
log-likelihood ℓ( y , u ; θ). The
observations y include biomarker measurements
{ y ij } at each visit. The
unknown parameters are the subject-specific variable distribution parameters m and ν , the trajectory parameters a and b , and the noise covariance parameters λ and ρ .

( y , u ) are the complete data. Let θ ′ = { m ′, ν ′, a ′, b ′, λ ′, ρ ′} be the previous parameter estimates. By
Proposition A.1, the E-step integral is proportional to Σ i ∫ Φ ( u ~ i ; u ^ i ′ , Σ i ′ ) ℓ ( y i , u ~ i ; θ ) d u ~ i , where Φ is the
multivariate normal probability density function with mean (10) u ^ i ′ = ( ∑ j Z i j ′ T R ′ − 1 Z i j ′ + V ′ − 1 ) − 1 ( ∑ j Z i j ′ T R ′ − 1 ( y i j − b ′ ) + V ′ − 1 m ′ ) , and covariance Σ i ′ = ( Σ j Z i j ′ T R ′ − 1 Z i j ′ + V ′ − 1 ) − 1 . Note that for individuals with a single visit, Σ j Z i j ′ T R ′ − 1 Z i j ′ is a singular matrix. Considering u i as parameters, as in Jedynak et al. (2012) or Bilgel et al. (2015c) , is equivalent to
assuming that V has infinitely large diagonal elements (i.e.,
an uninformative uniform prior) such that its inverse disappears. Therefore, it
is not possible to compute u ^ i ′ for individuals having only one visit using
this approach. On the other hand, incorporation of a bivariate normal prior on
the subject-specific variables u i allows Eq. 10 to be computed for
individuals with a single visit.

Evaluation of the E-step integral involves second moments of a Gaussian
random variable. We ignore the terms that do not depend on θ as they will not be relevant in the maximization step and obtain: (11) Q ( θ , θ ′ ) = − 1 2 ∑ i , j log ∣ R ∣ − 1 2 ∑ i , j ( y i j − Z i j u ^ i ′ − b ) T R − 1 ( y i j − Z i j u ^ i ′ − b ) − 1 2 ∑ i , j Tr ( Z i j T R − 1 Z i j Σ i ′ ) − 1 2 ∑ i log ∣ V ∣ − 1 2 ∑ i ( u ^ i ′ − m ) T V − 1 ( u ^ i ′ − m ) − 1 2 ∑ i Tr ( V − 1 Σ i ′ ) .

Here, we provide the update equations for the EM algorithm obtained by
maximizing Q ( θ , θ ′) with respect to each parameter, and provide
derivations for these update equations in the Appendix . The update equations depend on previous parameter
estimates θ ′ = { m ′, ν ′, a ′, b ′, λ ′, ρ ′} as well as the progression score estimates s i j ′ = q i j T u ^ i ′ , where u ^ i ′ is as given in Eq. 10 : (12) a = ( ∑ i v i ) ( ∑ i , j y i j s i j ′ ) − ( ∑ i , j y i j ) ( ∑ i , j s i j ′ ) ( ∑ i v i ) ( ∑ i , j q i j T Σ i ′ q i j + s i j ′ 2 ) − ( ∑ i , j s i j ′ ) 2 , (13) b = ( ∑ i , j y i j ) ( ∑ i , j q i j T Σ i ′ q i j + s i j ′ 2 ) − ( ∑ i , j y i j s i j ′ ) ( ∑ i , j s i j ′ ) ( ∑ i v i ) ( ∑ i , j q i j T Σ i ′ q i j + s i j ′ 2 ) − ( ∑ i , j s i j ′ ) 2 , (14) m = 1 n ∑ i u ^ i ′ , (15) ν = ν arg max Q ( θ , θ ′ ) , (16) λ , ρ = λ , ρ arg max Q ( θ , θ ′ ) . Note that if C is fixed to be the identity
matrix, a closed form solution for λ exists, as given in Equation A.15 . Once the
optimal parameters are found, the subject-specific variables are predicted using Eq. (10) .

As described in Proposition A.2, there are certain reparameterizations
that yield identical models. For example, one can multiply the trajectory slope
parameters by 2 and divide all progression scores by 2 (which is achieved by
dividing all α and β values by 2) without altering the model. This
is the scaling degree of freedom. There is also a translation degree of freedom.
We account for these degrees of freedom and anchor the model by calibrating the
progression score scale. We calibrate such that baseline PS has a mean of 0 and
a standard deviation of 1. This involves replacing the model parameters
{ m , V ( ν ), a , b , R ( λ , ρ )} with { w m + [ 0 z ] , w 2 V ( ν ) , 1 w a , b − z w a , R ( λ , ρ ) } , where − z w = 1 n Σ i s i 1 is the mean progression score at baseline, and 1 w = 1 n Σ i ( s i 1 − 1 n Σ i s i 1 ) 2 is the standard deviation of baseline
progression scores. We standardize the subject-specific estimates
α i ,
β i , and s ij accordingly: α i ∗ = w α i , β i ∗ = w β i + z , and s i j ∗ = w s i j + z . This reparametrization yields a PS scale where
0 corresponds to the sample average at baseline and the variance of PS at
baseline is 1.

We first fit the model assuming that C = I K × K and Λ is a diagonal matrix with positive elements λ .
We denote the estimated Λ in this model as Λ ^ . The estimates obtained from this model for the
parameters a , b , m , V are used as initializations in the model where C = C (ρ). In this model where correlations are taken
into account, we assume that Λ = λ Λ ^ , where λ is an unknown parameter to be
estimated. The spatial correlation function among those presented in Table 1 that results in the highest
log-likelihood value is chosen for the final model.

The EM algorithm is implemented in MATLAB 8.1 and Statistics Toolbox 8.2
(The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Our code is freely available online. 1

We use bootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling to estimate confidence
intervals for each model parameter. We sample with replacement from the original
collection of subjects to generate a new dataset containing an equal number of
subjects and fit the model on this generated sample. This sampling and fitting
procedure is repeated to generate bootstrap estimates. We then compute 95%
confidence intervals for each parameter across the bootstrap estimates. In the
bootstrap experiments, we fix the value of ρ at its estimate on the whole
sample to enable faster computation.

We compared our model to a linear mixed effects (LME) model that
included random intercepts and slopes at each voxel. The LME model for subject i , visit j and voxel k is
given by (17) y ijk = ( η k + η i k ) t i j + ( γ k + γ i k ) + ε ijk , where ( η k γ k ) are the fixed effects, ( η i k γ i k ) ~ N ( 0 , Ξ k ) are the random effects and ε ijk ~ N ( 0 , σ k 2 ) is the observation noise. We used the LME
implementation in MATLAB Statistics Toolbox 8.2.

We simulated visits such that the sample was similar to our PET data in
terms of number of visits per subjects and age range. We generated a data set
with 100 individuals, each with up to 7 visits with 5 × 5 × 5
images with 4 mm isotropic voxels. We fixed the ground truth values of the model
parameters θ = { m , ν , a , b , λ , ρ} at values
close to those we observed in exploratory models fitted to DVR data. We
generated u i from a bivariate normal
distribution with mean m and variance V ( ν ). The progression score for each visit was then
computed as s i j = q i j T u , and observations were generated using the PS
model. We performed 1000 bootstrap iterations to obtain 95% confidence intervals
for each parameter and subject-specific variable. We computed the cosine
similarity for each variable for each bootstrap experiment using (18) ϕ T ϕ ^ ‖ ϕ ‖ 2 ‖ ϕ ^ ‖ 2 , where ϕ ^ is the estimate of the variable of interest
( a , b , α , β , or s ) and ϕ is the
corresponding ground truth value. A value of 1 indicates a perfect estimate.

We used longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) data for
participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging ( Shock et al., 1984 ) neuroimaging substudy
( Resnick et al., 2000 ). Participant
demographics are presented in Table 2 .
Starting in 2005, amyloid-beta (Aβ) PET scans were acquired on a GE
Advance scanner over 70 minutes following an intravenous bolus injection of
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), yielding dynamic PET scans with 33 time frames. PET
images were reconstructed using filtered backprojection with a ramp filter,
yielding a spatial resolution of approximately 4.5 mm full width at half max at
the center of the field of view (image matrix = 128 × 128, 35 slices,
pixel size = 2 × 2 mm, slice thickness = 4.25 mm).

The frames of each dynamic PiB-PET scan were aligned to the average of
the first two minutes to remove motion ( Jenkinson et al., 2002 ). For registration purposes, we obtained
static images by averaging the first 20 minutes of the dynamic PiB-PET scan.
Follow-up PiB-PET scans were rigidly registered onto the baseline PiB-PET within
each participant using the 20-minute average images. Baseline magnetic resonance
images (MRIs) were rigidly registered onto their corresponding 20-minute PiB-PET
average, and their FreeSurfer segmentations ( Dale et al., 1999 ; Desikan et al.,
2006 ) were transformed accordingly. Distribution volume ratio (DVR)
images were calculated in the native space of each PiB-PET image using the
simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellar gray matter as reference
tissue ( Zhou et al., 2003 ). The MRIs
coregistered with the PET were deformably registered ( Avants et al., 2008 ) onto a study-specific template ( Avants et al., 2010 ; Bilgel et al., 2015b ) and transformed to 4 mm isotropic MNI
space using a pre-calculated affine transformation. The resulting mappings were
applied to the DVR images that have been registered to baseline to bring them
into the MNI space. We used all voxels within the brain mask in the MNI space to
fit the PS model.

Mean cortical DVR is a widely used measure obtained from PiB-PET images
for quantifying the level of brain amyloid. We computed mean cortical DVR for
each PiB-PET image by averaging the voxelwise DVR values across cingulate,
frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and lateral occipital cortices, excluding
the sensorimotor strip. We used a mean cortical DVR threshold of 1.06, which was
computed from a two-class Gaussian mixture model fitted on baseline measures, to
separate individuals into PiB- and PiB+ groups, as described in Bilgel et al. (2015a) .

The confidence intervals obtained via bootstrapping allow for hypothesis
testing. For the amyloid images, we focus on studying the precuneus, since
previous cross-sectional amyloid imaging studies have suggested that precuneus
has the highest deposition levels ( Mintun et
al., 2006 ) and provided preliminary evidence that it may be the most
rapid accumulator ( Rodrigue et al., 2012 )
among cortical regions. Our specific hypotheses are as follows: The precuneus has the highest amyloid load along stages of
amyloid accumulation. The precuneus accumulates amyloid faster than other cortical
regions. We refer to the progression scores calculated using the DVR images as
Aβ-PS. To test the first hypothesis, we compare the amyloid levels in the
precuneus with other regions at various Aβ-PS values spanning the range
observed in our data set. Our purpose in performing these comparisons is to shed
light onto the temporal ordering of changes in di erent cortical regions. For
each bootstrap experiment, we average the predicted DVR levels y ^ k ( s ) = a k s + b k within each ROI to obtain (19) y ^ r ( s ) = 1 ∣ ROI r ∣ ∑ k ∈ ROI r y ^ k ( s ) , where k is the voxel index and r is the ROI index. We then compute the following statistic
for each bootstrap: (20) T = y ^ precuneus ( s ) − max r ≠ precuneus y ^ r ( s ) . We reject the null hypothesis that the amyloid load in the
precuneus at Aβ-PS = s is not different from other
regions at significance level γ if the two-sided 100(1−γ)
confidence interval of the test statistic T , computed using the
bootstrap estimates of T , does not contain 0. The smallest
value of γ such that the two-sided 100(1−γ) confidence
interval of the test statistic T contains 0 is the p -value of the test.

The precuneus has the highest amyloid load along stages of
amyloid accumulation.

The precuneus accumulates amyloid faster than other cortical
regions.

To test the second hypothesis, we pursue a similar approach using the
trajectory slope parameter a. For each bootstrap experiment, we obtain the
average a k per cortical ROI to
obtain a r , where r the ROI index. We then compute the following statistic for each bootstrap: (21) T = a precuneus − max r ≠ precuneus a r . The condition for the rejection of the null hypothesis that the
rate of amyloid accumulation in the precuneus is not different from that of
other regions is as described previously.

## 3. Results
The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was 39.0 × 10 3 for the LME model, 32.0 × 10 3 for the PS model where C = I K × K ,
and −1.6 × 10 3 for the PS model where C = C (ρ), indicating that the PS
model where spatial correlations are modeled fits the data the best. We computed
the percentage of variables that are “correct” by counting the
variables whose ground truth values fell within the 95% confidence interval
computed via bootstrapping. For example, for a and b ,
a value of 10% indicates that 10% of the biomarkers had a correct estimate for a k and b k . For α and
β, 10% indicates that 10% of the individuals had a correct estimate for
α i and
β i . For s , 10% indicates
that 10% of the visits had a correct estimate for s ij . Simulation results are
presented in Table 3 . When there are
correlations in the data, not modeling them yields inaccurate estimates for the
trajectory slope parameter a , the subject-specific variables
α i ,
β i , and the progression scores s ij . Using the correlation
model improves these estimates significantly.

In our preliminary analysis of the noise spatial correlation structure
using the semivariogram ( Cressie and Hawkins,
1980 ; Bilgel et al., 2015c ), we
observed that the rational quadratic had the best fit to the empirical
semivariogram ( Inline
Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Rational quadratic also yielded the fit with
largest log-likelihood, and thus was selected as the correlation function for
the model. AIC was −1.2 × 10 7 for the LME model,
−1.1 × 10 7 for the model where C = I K × K ,
and −2.0 × 10 7 for the model where C = C (ρ), indicating that the PS model where spatial
correlations are modeled fits the data the best. The spatial correlation
parameter ρ for the rational quadratic correlation model was estimated to
be 4.5 mm, and λ was estimated to be 0.929. A comparison of the PS values
obtained from the di erent correlation models are presented in the Supplementary Material (Inline
Supplementary Fig. 2) . Model fitting using 104 subjects with a total
of 300 visits each having about 30, 000 brain voxels took approximately 5
seconds on an Intel Xeon 8-core 3.1 GHz machine with 128 GB RAM for the case
where voxels are assumed to be independent (i.e., C = I K × K ).
The following model fitting with C = C (ρ) took approximately 30 minutes per EM iteration,
with convergence achieved in 2 to 6 iterations depending on the correlation
structure.

We compared the subject-specific variables obtained from model
fitting to empirical values obtained from mean cortical DVR, which is the
widely used measure for quantifying levels of brain amyloid ( Fig. 5 ). For each individual with at
least two visits, we fit a line to the mean cortical DVR data to estimate
the slope of amyloid accumulation as well as the intercept. The
subject-specific variable α i , which
represents the rate of amyloid progression, explained 62% of the variability
in the empirical slope of amyloid accumulation computed from longitudinal
mean cortical DVR. We observed a much higher correlation between mean
cortical DVR and Aβ-PS ( R 2 = 0.95 at
baseline and 0.96 at last visit).

When plotted against age, mean cortical DVR and Aβ-PS
revealed similar patterns ( Fig. 6 ). The
progression as measured using voxelwise DVR data is not linearly associated
with age, and the Aβ-PS was able to capture this.

The trajectory slope parameters a k obtained from the PS
model ( Fig. 7 ) revealed symmetric
patterns across the cerebral hemispheres. The precuneus and frontal lobe
showed the greatest increases in DVR with Aβ-PS, smaller increases in
lateral temporal and temporoparietal regions, and minimal increases in the
occipital lobe and the sensorimotor strip. Voxelwise trajectories are
further illustrated in Fig. 8 , which
shows the predicted DVR values on the cortical surface at three Aβ-PS
levels.

In order to better investigate regional trends, we averaged the PS
model results within each cortical ROI and plotted these ROI averages as a
function of Aβ-PS ( Fig. 9 ). We
used bootstrap results to compute 95% confidence bands for these ROI
averages. Based on the 95% confidence band of the precuneus illustrated in Fig. 9 , precuneus appears to be the
earliest accumulator and has the highest amyloid levels through late stages
of amyloid accumulation (Aβ-PS≥ 2). We present confidence
bands for other cortical regions in Fig.
10 .

Based on our hypothesis testing procedure, we found that precuneus
had the highest amyloid levels at Aβ-PS values of −0.5, 0, 1,
2, and 3 (all p < 0.01). On the other hand, while
the estimated rate of amyloid accumulation was highest in the precuneus,
this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.33). A
comparison of the levels of amyloid at Aβ-PS= 0 and rates of
accumulation across ROIs is presented in Fig.
11 .

The trajectories we obtained using the PS model were consistent with
the results of the LME model ( Inline Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 ). However, the fixed
effects obtained from the LME model did not describe the observed data as
well as the trajectory slopes obtained from the PS model ( Inline Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Using the LME model estimates and a bootstrapping procedure
similar to the one we applied for the PS model, we found that the precuneus
had the highest regional amyloid levels compared to other cortical regions
at ages 70, 80, and 90 (all p < 0.01), but not at
age 65 ( p = 0.12). Similar to our findings based on the PS
model, the rate of amyloid accumulation was highest in the precuneus, but
this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.75). A
comparison of the levels of amyloid at the mean baseline age of the sample
and rates of accumulation across ROIs is presented in Inline Supplementary Fig.
6 .

## 4. Discussion
We presented a statistical model for estimating longitudinal trajectories of
voxelwise neuroimaging data. Our model is based on the concept that age is not a
good metric for disease progression since each individual has his or her own onset
and rate of progression of disease. We accounted for these inter-individual di
erences to temporally align individuals based on their collection of voxelwise
measurements. As a result of this temporal alignment, we obtained a metric of
disease or underlying biological process stage as reflected in the neuroimaging
data, and we call this metric “progression score”. By analyzing
voxelwise neuroimaging data as a function of progression score rather than time, we
constructed trajectories that better represent changes occurring with disease
stage.

Simulation results showed that the progression score model fits the data
better than the linear mixed effects model, as evidenced by AIC. Furthermore, the
results showed that modeling spatial correlations is important for extracting
accurate summary scores from data with underlying correlations. In the absence of
correlation modeling when the underlying data are correlated, estimates of the
trajectory slopes a as well as subject-specific variables α, β, and s were adversely affected. The difference in the
subject-specific variables was mainly due to inaccurate estimates of the prior
covariance V . Note that (22) Cov ( y i j ) = aq i j T V q i j a T + R , which explains why both a and V are
affected when correlations are not modeled through the covariance matrix R . This highlights the importance of modeling spatial
correlations in data where such effects are evident, especially in order to estimate
correct trajectory slopes and individualized progression scores. To further
understand this phenomenon, we conducted simulations (data not presented) where we
duplicated biomarkers with lower signal-to-noise ratios and repeated model fitting
including these duplicate biomarkers. We observed that the parameter estimates as
well as the PS values were biased if we assumed independence across biomarkers. This
might be because the model interprets each of the duplicated biomarkers as a
separate piece of evidence towards the computation of individual progression scores.
However, when we included a proper noise correlation model, we were able to recover
our original results on the collection of unique biomarkers.

The proposed EM framework simplifies the estimation of spatial correlation
parameters, and accurately estimates the trajectory parameters a and b as well as predicting the progression scores s .
The performance of the fitting procedure in predicting α and β is
worse than for s . This may be due to the modeling of α and
β as random variables that do not directly contribute to the observations y . We observed a similar pattern in the amyloid data: the agreement
between estimated Aβ-PS and mean cortical DVR was greater than the agreement
between estimated α and the rate of change of mean cortical DVR per
individual. This suggests that the progression scores are more reliable than the
subject-specific variables. Aβ-PS was highly correlated with mean cortical
DVR, a widely used measure for quantifying PiB-PET scans and assessing longitudinal
change. This indicates that Aβ-PS is a meaningful score extracted from
voxelwise imaging data. Unlike mean cortical DVR, there are no a
priori assumptions regarding which regions or voxels should be included
in the computation of Aβ-PS. This property of PS allows for the discovery of
new patterns in longitudinal data.

Trajectories obtained from the PS model captured a wider dynamic range of
DVR values and had a better fit to the observed data compared to the trajectories
obtained using the LME model fixed effects. This difference between the PS and LME
models underscores the fact that age is not an appropriate metric for staging
amyloid accumulation. By aligning individuals based on their amyloid scans, the PS
model enables a better temporal metric of amyloid staging.

Aβ-PS allows for the exploration of longitudinal voxelwise
trajectories within a hypothesis testing framework due to its underlying statistical
model. Our results suggest that the precuneus exhibits the earliest cortical amyloid
changes, but that its rate of amyloid accumulation does not differ significantly
from other cortical regions. Based on a qualitative evaluation of our estimated
trajectories, we found that amyloid accumulation in the precuneus is followed by
cingulate and frontal cortices, then by lateral parietal cortex, followed by insula
and lateral temporal cortex. We observed minimal amyloid accumulation in visual
cortex, hippocampal formation and the sensorimotor strip, which agrees with previous
reports that these regions accumulate amyloid in later stages of AD ( Braak and Braak, 1991 ). Previous reports have
highlighted precuneus as an early amyloid accumulator ( Mintun et al., 2006 ; Rodrigue
et al., 2012 ) as well as frontal, cingulate, and parietal regions ( Jack et al., 2008 ). Contrary to our finding
highlighting precuneus as the earliest cortical accumulator, a study of cognitively
normal adults found that the right medial frontal cortex accumulates amyloid the
earliest, closely followed by bilateral precuneus based on cross-sectional voxelwise
analyses ( Villeneuve et al., 2015 ). We
presented regional trajectories averaged bilaterally in this work; however,
hemisphere-specific trajectories were consistent with our bilaterally-averaged
trajectories and we did not observe that medial frontal cortex precedes precuneus.
Further studies with larger samples will be instrumental in elucidating the regional
progression of amyloid accumulation.

One of the strengths of our model for the progression scores s is that there are no a priori assumptions on
the global form of s ( t ), which can be thought of
as an underlying function that describes the evolution of progression score over
time. Instead, the model makes linear local approximations to s ( t ) per individual. The linear form we use
makes the EM approach analytically tractable and enables the discovery of the global
form of s ( t ). On the other hand, the linear
relationship we assume between s and t is also a
limitation since it may be an oversimplification over long follow-up durations. In
order to capture dynamics over longer periods more accurately, it is necessary to
investigate the relationship between the progression scores s and
time t , and select an appropriate function to link these
variables.

Another limitation of our model is the assumption of linear biomarker
trajectories. This assumption is not reflective of the fact that voxelwise DVR has a
theoretical minimum of 1 (while in practice, there are DVR values lower than 1 due
to noise). Furthermore, several studies of longitudinal amyloid deposition have
found evidence for a ceiling effect in amyloid deposition in late AD, suggesting a
sigmoid trajectory for amyloid levels ( Villemagne et
al., 2013 ; Villain et al., 2012 ).
Our use of a linear rather than sigmoid trajectory inevitably results in
inaccuracies in PS calculation for individuals whose voxelwise data lie along the
plateaus of the sigmoid in reality. The linear trajectory assumption may also
prevent us from characterizing subtler differences in the temporal ordering of the
onset of amyloid accumulation across different regions. However, linear
trajectories, unlike sigmoid trajectories, yield closed-form update equations for
trajectory parameters, greatly facilitating the model fitting procedure.

The spatial covariance functions we used in our analyses are covariance
functions of strictly stationary isotropic processes. The underlying spatial noise
process is affected by the PET scanner, image reconstruction algorithm, radiotracer
delivery and binding in different brain regions, kinetic parameter estimation
algorithm, and registration methods used to bring all scans in alignment. To
accurately model these influences on noise, complex noise spatial covariance models
are needed. In this work, we made simplifying assumptions on the noise properties to
facilitate the study of longitudinal trajectories of amyloid images. As a result of
these simplifications, our model does not accurately capture noise properties;
however, by eliminating the inaccurate assumption of independence across voxels, our
approach improves the accuracy of the estimated trajectories and progression scores.
Refined spatial noise models incorporating non-stationarity and anisotropy may
further improve the estimation accuracy.

Our model can be applied to studying higher resolution images. To reduce
computational memory burden, it may be necessary to impose sparsity on the spatial
correlation matrix, which can be done by imposing a correlation value of 0 at large
distances. The sparsity property of the correlation matrix can be taken advantage of
to yield Cholesky decompositions using less memory and time.

In conclusion, the progression score model allows for extracting summary
scores from longitudinal data for each scan. In this work, we have extended the
progression score model proposed by Jedynak et al.
(2012) to voxelwise imaging data by accounting for spatial correlations
and enabling efficient handling of the large number of voxels through the EM
framework. The incorporation of a prior on subject-specific variables allowed for
the inclusion of individuals with a single visit in the model. Our method can be
extended to the analysis of other types of imaging data, and in cases where a
summary score such as mean cortical DVR is not available, the progression score
estimates can be highly informative for progression staging.
