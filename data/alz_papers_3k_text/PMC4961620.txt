Unexpected role of interferon-γ in regulating neuronal connectivity and social behavior

# Abstract
Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental disorders. Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behavior, such as spatial learning and memory 1 . Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behavior; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to T cell–derived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social behavior and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-γ and increase GABAergic currents in projection neurons, suggesting that IFN-γ is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behavior. Meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of a range of organisms revealed that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFN-γ/JAK-STAT–dependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link between social/aggregation behavior and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-γ, in disorders characterized by social dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between social behavior and an anti-pathogen immune response driven by IFN-γ signaling.

## Methods
All mice (C57BL/6) were either bred in-house or purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. For each individual experiment, the control mice were obtained from the same institution as test mice. In the case that mice were purchased, they were maintained for at least one week to habituate prior to manipulation/experimentation. When possible, mice used for experiments were littermates. These include all electrophysiology experiments, all cohorts using Stat1 fl/fl mice, experiments analyzing induced seizures, experiments counting c-fos + neurons, and experiments using Il4 −/− mice. Experiments assessing the social behavior of SCID mice using the 3-chamber assay include mice breed in-house and mice purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All other experiment used mice purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Experimental groups were blinded and randomly assigned prior to the start of experimentation and remained blinded until all data were collected. Mice were housed under standard 12 hour light/dark cycle conditions in rooms equipped to control for temperature and humidity. Unless stated otherwise, male mice were tested at 8–10 weeks of age. Sample sizes were chosen based on a power analysis using estimates from previously published experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Virginia.

For cohorts tested with multiple behavioral assay, the elevated plus-maze was performed first and then followed by the open field before any other assay. Prior to all experiments, mice were transported to the behavior room and given 1 hour to habituate. All behavioral testing was conducted during daylight hours.

Mice were placed into the center hub and allowed to explore the plus-maze for 10 minutes. Video tracking software (CleverSys) was used to quantify time spent in the open arms.

Mice were placed into the open field (35cm × 35cm) and allowed to explore for 15 minutes. Total distance and time spent in the center (23cm × 23cm) were quantified using video tracking software (CleverSys).

Mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod (MedAssociates) that accelerated from 4.0–40 rpm over 5 minutes. Infrared beams were used to quantify the latency of a mouse to fall of the rod. Mice were given 6 trials with a 4-hour break between trial 3 and 4.

The three-chamber sociability test was conducted as previously described 31 . Briefly, mice were transported to the testing room and habituated for at least one hour. The room was maintained in dim light and a white noise generator used to mitigate any unforeseen noises. Test boxes were fabricated, in-house, by a machine shop. Test mice were placed in the center chamber with the two outer chambers containing empty wire cages (Spectrum Diversified Designs) and allowed to explore for ten minutes (habituation phase). After the habituation phase, mice were return to the center chamber. A novel mouse (an 8–10 week old male C57BL/6J ~ 18–22g) was placed under one cup and an object placed under the other. Prior to testing, the novel mouse was habituated to the cup by being placed under the cup for 10 minutes, 3 times a day for 5 days. Mice were allowed to explore for an additional ten minutes (social phase). A video tracking system (CleverSys) was used to quantify the time spent around each target. For 3-chamber experiments comparing social behavior between wild-type and SCID mice, data collected using males and females were combined because no significant effects were found between genders. When females were tested, juvenile C57BL/6J male (approximately 4 weeks old) mice were used as novel demonstrators.

Mice were single housed and maintained un-manipulated for 5 days, then placed in a novel/social environment with a mouse (opposite sex and identical scid genotype) under video surveillance as previously described 31 . After 2 hours, mice were sacrificed and prepared for immunohistochemistry as described below. The time spent interacting was measured by a blinded observer for 5 minutes at the 30, 60, and 90 minute post-introduction time points.

The protocol for rsfMRI was adapted from Zhan et al. 32 . Mice were maintained under light anesthesia with (1–1.25%) isoflurane and images were acquired on a 7.0 Tesla MRI Clinscan system (Bruker, Etlingen, Germany) using a 30-mm inner-diameter mouse whole-body radiofrequency coil. High-resolution structural images were acquired by collecting 16 × 0.7mm thick coronal slices using TR/TE 5,500/65ms and an 180° flip angle. A BOLD rsfMRI time series of 16 × 0.7mm thick coronal slices were collected using TR/TE 4,000/17ms and a 60° flip angle. For analysis, a structural template 33 was custom labeled using “The Mouse Brain” by Paxinos and Franklin as reference ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ). The non-rigid transformation between the template and each individual mouse was estimated using the open source Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package 34 that was then used to propagate the regional labels to each subject. Cleaning of the bold fMRI data was performed using tools available in ANTsR 35 – a statistical and visualization interface between ANTs and the R statistical project. fMRI preprocessing consisted of motion correction 36 , band pass filtering (freq. = [0.002, 0.1]), and CompCor estimation 37 . The correlation matrix was determined from the clean fMRI data using the regions labels. To determine if the functional connectivity between sample groups was significantly different, we tested for the equality of their corresponding correlation matrices. First, an aggregate correlation matrix was constructed for each group by calculating the median value for each connection, and then the aggregate matrices were compared using the Jennrich test 38 , as implemented in the cortest.jennrich function in the R psych package. To create a functional connectivity network for a sample group, a correlation threshold was applied to the connections between regions of interest. If a connection strength was above the threshold, it was kept as an edge in the network, otherwise it was discarded. When comparing networks from multiple sample groups, the threshold was determined by calculating the maximum threshold that leaves one of the networks connected (i.e., it is possible to reach any node in the network from any other node).

Mice were sacrificed under Euthasol then transcardially perfused with PBS with heparin. Brains were removed and drop fixed in 4% PFA for 48 hours. After fixation, brains were washed with PBS, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, then frozen in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek) and sliced (40μM) with a cryostat (Leica). Free-floating sections were maintained in PBS + Azide (0.02%) until further processing. Immunohistochemistry for c-fos (1:1000 dilution; Millipore) on free-floating sections was performed as previously described 39 .

A rat monoclonal antibody to murine VLA4 (clone PS/2) was affinity purified from hybridoma supernatants and was used with the kind permission of Dr. Klaus Ley (La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA). Mice were given two separate injections ( i.p. ; 0.2mg in saline per mouse), four days apart, of either anti-VLA4 or rat anti-HRP for control (clone HRPN; BioXcell), then tested twenty-four hours post final injection.

Meninges were dissected as previously described 40 . Briefly, after sacrificing and perfusing, skulls caps were removed by making an incision along the parietal and squamosal bones. The meninges were removed from the internal side of the skull cap and gently pressed through a 70 μm nylon mesh cell strainer with sterile plastic plunger (BD Biosciences) to isolate a single cell suspension. Cells were then centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 10 min, resuspended in cold FACS buffer (pH 7,4; 0.1 M PBS; 1 mM EDTA; 1% BSA), and stained for extracellular markers using the following antibodies at a 1:200 dilution: CD45 PerCP-Cyanine5.5 (eBioscience), TCR BV510 (BD Bioscience), CD4 FITC (eBioscience), L/D Zombie NIR (BioLegend). To measure intracellular IFN-γ, single cell isolates from meninges were maintained in T cell isolation buffer (RPMI + 2% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 1X non-essential amino acids, and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher) and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (Cell Stimulation Cocktail – eBioscience) + 10 μg/ml brefeldin A at 37°C prior to extracellular staining as stated above. Cells were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and stained with IFN-γ APC (eBioscience; clone XMG1.2).

To measure expression of IFN-γ receptors, brains were removed and placed in Neurobasal media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The meninges were removed from the brain and the frontal cortex was micro-dissected under a dissection microscope. Using a 2 mL dounce homogenizer, brains were homogenized in Neurobasal media with 50U/mL Dnase I. The homogenate was passed through a 70μm nylon filter and washed with cold FACS buffer. IFNGR were labeled with anti-IFNGR1 Biotin (BD Pharmingen; GR20) or rabbit anti-IFNGR2 (Santa Cruz; M-20). Cells were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with FITC conjugated streptavidin or 488 conjugated chicken anti-rabbit. Next, cells were washed again then incubated with CD11B PE-Cyanine7 (eBioscience), L/D Zombie NIR (BioLegend), and Hoechst for 45 minutes. Cells were washed, then permeabilized and fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences). After another wash with permeabilization wash buffer (PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium azide, and 1% saponin; pH 7.4), cells were incubated overnight with NeuN PE (Millipore). Cells underwent a final wash and again passed through a 70μm nylon filter. Samples were run on a flow cytometer Gallios (Beckman Coulter) then analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar).

SCID mice were repopulated with cells from spleen and lymph nodes (axillary, brachial, cervical, inguinal, and lumbar). Spleen and lymph nodes were collected from a 3–4 week old donor and passed through a 70μm nylon mesh cell strainer with a sterile plastic plunger. ACK buffer was used to lyse red blood cells prior to washing with saline. Cells were counted on an automated cell counter (Nexcelom) and injected ( i.v. ) at 5×10 6 cells in 250μL of saline (control mice were injected with 250μL of saline only). For injections, the animal technician was blinded to the genotype of the mice and the content of the injection. Thus, all groups were handled identically. Mice aged 3–4 weeks were carefully placed into a tail vein injection platform. Their tails were briefly warmed using a heating pad and saline with cells or saline alone was slowly injected into the tail vein using a 28G needle. After the injection, mice were returned to their home cage.

Mice were anaesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine [ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg)] injection ( i.p. ) or isoflurane (2%), then placed into a stereotaxic frame with the head at an approximately 45° angle. The skin above cisterna magna was cleaned and sanitize before a 1 cm incision was made. The underlying muscles were separated with forceps, retracted, and a small Hamilton syringe (33G) was used to slowly inject 1uL of saline or IFN-γ (20ng; eBioscience) into the cisterna magna ( i.c.m. ). After injection the syringe was held in place for 5 minutes to avoid back-flow of CSF. After the syringe was removed, muscles were put back in place and skin was sutured. Mice were placed on a heating pad and given ketoprofen and baytril for recovery.

IFN-γ was injected ( i.c.m. ) into the CSF through the cisterna magna ( i.c.m. ), as described above, 24 hours prior to inducing seizures. Control mice were injected with the same volume of saline. To induce seizures, mice were injected with PTZ (40mg/kg; i.p. ). After injection, mice were placed into an empty housing cage and recorded for video analysis. Seizures were analyzed by a blinded observer using a behavior scoring system previously published 41 .

Diazepam (1.25mg/kg) was delivered i.p. for 30 minutes prior to testing for social behavior.

Mice were euthanized then transcardially perused with PBS with heparin followed by 4% PFA. Brains were then removed and drop fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours, frozen in OCT, and 12μM sections were cut on a cryostat. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed using RNA ISH tissue assay kits (Affymetrix) following the manufacture’s protocol. Tissues were treated with protease for 20 minutes at 40°C. 63× Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal system (Leica Microsystems) using the LAS AF Software.

AAV1.hSyn.HI.eGFP-Cre.WPRE.SV40 and AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH were purchased from Penn Vector Core. IFNGR1 fl/fl mice were purchased from the Jackson lab. After 1 week of habituation, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and injected bilaterally with 2×10 10 genome copies of AAV virus in 1 μL at stereotaxic coordinates: +2.5μM bregma A/P, 0.25μM lateral, 1.25μM deep.

Visualized whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on layer 2/3 prefrontal cortical neurons prepared from acute brain slices (adult) using the protective recovery method 42 . Recordings were performed in 34°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 131.5 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 12 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , and 1 MgCl 2 . ACSF also contained 3mM kynurenic acid to block synaptic excitation and 2.5mM NO-711 to enhance tonic inhibition 43 . Slices were incubated in this ACSF for 5–10 minutes prior to placement in the recording chamber. The patch pipette solution with elevated chloride contained (in mM) 140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 0.05 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Mg-GTP 43 . Once recordings equilibrated, baseline holding current in ACSF was measured for 3.5 minutes, after which ACSF containing IFN-γ (20pg/mL) was applied for 8.5 minutes and then washed. Data presented show the mean holding current during the last minute of control (ACSF) and drug (ACSF+IFN-γ) conditions.

8 week old, male mice were purchased from The Jackson Lab and housed in standard housing boxes either 4 mice per cage or isolated for 6 days. Mice were euthanized as described above and the PFC was microdissected under a dissection microscope. RNA was isolated using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and a cDNA library was generated with a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) with Agencourt AMPure XP beads for PCR cleanup. Samples were loaded onto a NextSeq 500 High-output 75 cycle cartridge and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).

Raw FASTQ sequencing reads were chastity filtered to remove clusters having outlying intensity corresponding to bases other than the called base. Filtered reads were assessed for quality using FastQC 44 . Reads were splice-aware aligned to the UCSC mm9 genome using STAR 45 , and reads overlapping UCSC mm9 gene regions were counted using featureCounts 46 . The DESeq2 Bioconductor package 47 in the R statistical computing environment 48 was used for normalizing count data, performing exploratory data analysis, estimating dispersion, and fitting a negative binomial model for each gene comparing the expression from the PFC of mice in a social environment versus isolation. After obtaining a list of differentially expressed genes, log fold changes, and P -values, Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate procedure was used to correct P -values for multiple testing. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm 49 was applied to identify the enrichment of transcriptional signatures and molecular pathways in PFC transcriptomes of mice exposed to group and isolation housing conditions. 4726 publicly available transcriptional signatures were obtained from the molecular Signature Database C2 version 4.0 and GSEA was used to examine the distribution of these curated gene sets in lists of genes ordered according to differential expression between group and isolation housing conditions. The statistical analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P -value and normalized enrichment score (NES) based on 1,000 random sample permutations.

The custom-made IFN-γ and pathogen-induced transcriptional signatures ( Supplementary Table 2 ) were generated by retrieving genes upregulated ≥ 2 fold following IFN-γ stimulation or pathogen infection. All custom signatures were derived from publicly available transcriptomes downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Specifically, mammalian IFN-γ transcriptional signatures were derived from transcriptomes: GSE33057, GSE19182, GSE36287, GSE9659, GSE1432 and GSE6353. Zebrafish IFN-γ transcriptional signature was used as described 50 . Drosophila pathogen-induced JAK/STAT-dependent transcriptional signatures were derived from transcriptomes: GSE54833 and GSE2828.

A GSEA algorithm was applied to identify the enrichment of custom-made mammalian IFN-γ transcriptional signatures in the publicly available brain cortex transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to: social aggregation, sleep deprivation, stress, psychostimulants (DOI, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, caffeine, nicotine and modafinil), antipsychotics (olanzapine, haloperidol and risperidone), anticonvulsants (levetiracetam, phenytoin, ethosuximide and oxcarbazepine), and antidepressants (iproniazid, moclobemide, paroxetine and phenelzine). In total, 41 transcriptomes were analyzed as indicated in Supplementary Table 2 . The statistical analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P -value and NES based on 1,000 random sample permutations. Zebrafish are social fish that aggregate into shoals 51 – 54 . Various Zebrafish strains differ in their preference for social interaction and novelty, resembling the phenotypic variation of inbred mouse strains 55 , 56 . Notably, domesticated zebrafish strains demonstrate higher social interaction and social novelty preference 57 – 59 compared to wild zebrafish strains. Therefore, a GSEA algorithm was used to identify the enrichment of Zebrafish IFN-γ transcriptional signature in the publicly available whole-brain transcriptomic profiles of behaviorally distinct strains of domesticated and wild zebrafish ( Supplementary Table 7 ). The brain transcriptomic profiles of domesticated (Scientific Hatcheries (SH) and Transgenic Mosaic 1 (TM1)) and wild (Nadia, Gaighata) zebrafish strains were derived from publicly available transcriptome data set: GSE38729. The statistical analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P -value and NES based on 1,000 random gene set permutations.

Social interactions in Drosophila melanogaster flies play an important role in courtship, mating, egg-laying, circadian timing, food search and even life-span determination 60 – 65 . Notably, a number of studies have demonstrated that social isolation leads to an aggressive behavior in Drosophila flies, whereas group housing suppresses the aggressiveness 66 – 68 . Therefore, we employed a GSEA algorithm to identify the enrichment of JAK/STAT-dependent transcriptional signatures in the publicly available brain transcriptomes of Drosophila populations that were socially-induced or genetically-selected for low-aggressive (i.e. social) behavior ( Supplementary Table 7 ). The transcriptomic profiles were derived from publicly available transcriptome data sets: GSE5404 and GSE6994. The statistical analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P -value and NES based on 1,000 random gene set permutations.

A GSEA algorithm was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in brain transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to social aggregation, domesticated Zebrafish strains and low-aggressive Drosophila melanogaster populations, compared to their control counterparts. High-scoring differentially expressed “leading-edge” social genes were selected based on their presence in the IFN-γ and pathogen-induced transcriptional signatures. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3 , we have identified 31, 48, 14, 53 leading-edge genes in brain transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to social aggregation, domesticated Zebrafish strain, and low-aggressive Drosophila melanogaster population, respectively. We next, extracted promoter sequences of 200bp up-stream of TSS of these “leading edge” genes using UCSC Genome Browser ( https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ). The MEME suite was then used to discover overrepresented transcription factor binding motifs, as described 69 . MEME parameters used were any number of motif repetitions per sequence, with a minimum motif width of 5 bases and maximum motif width of 15 bases. The discovered MEME motifs were compared using Tomtom analysis. In this case, the Tomtom motif similarity analysis ranks the MEME motif most similar to the Vertebrates in vivo and in silico , canonical motif for STAT. The statistics was determined using Euclidean distance.

A GSEA algorithm was applied to identify the enrichment of IFN-γ, IL-4/IL-13, IL-17, and IL-10/TGF-β signaling pathways in the brain transcriptomes of rodent animals exposed to: social aggregation, stress, psychostimulants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. All custom signatures were derived from publically available rodent transcriptomes downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Statistical significance of GSEA results was assessed using 1,000 sample permutations. A NES greater than 1.5 and nominal P -value less than 0.05 was used to determined pairwise transcriptome connectivity. Circos graph was generated using circos package 0.68.12 70 .

Data were analyzed using the statistical methods stated in each figure legend. For the 3-chamber assay, a 2-way ANOVA was performed using genotype/treatment and sociability as main effects, followed by applying a Sidak’s post-hoc comparison to assess if the group had a significant social preference. Prior to running an ANOVA, an equality of variance was determined by using a Brown-Forsythe test. Bars display the means, and error bars represent ranges of the standard error of the mean. For rsfMRI, data were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s test. The box and whisker plots extend to the 25 th and 75 th percentiles and the center line indicates the mean. The whiskers represent the min and max data points. Data for seizure latency was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a post-hoc Sidak test. Additional details of statistical analysis are supplied in Supplementary Table 8 .
