# Title
Neuronal subtypes and diversity revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the human brain

# Abstract
The human brain has enormously complex cellular diversity and connectivities fundamental to our neural functions, yet difficulties in interrogating individual neurons has impeded understanding of the underlying transcriptional landscape. We developed a scalable approach to sequence and quantify RNA molecules in isolated neuronal nuclei from post-mortem brain, generating 3,227 sets of single neuron data from six distinct regions of the cerebral cortex. Using an iterative clustering and classification approach, we identified 16 neuronal subtypes that were further annotated on the basis of known markers and cortical cytoarchitecture. These data demonstrate a robust and scalable method for identifying and categorizing single nuclear transcriptomes, revealing shared genes sufficient to distinguish novel and orthologous neuronal subtypes as well as regional identity within the human brain.

## Main Text
While significant progress has been achieved in mice ( 1 – 3 ), comprehensive classification of adult human brain neurons on the basis of their single-cell transcriptomes has yet to be realized. Examination of individual neuronal gene expression profiles for functional patterns could provide unbiased insights into subtypes from defined neuroanatomical regions, which are missed by gross anatomical studies that report limited transcriptomic differences across the neocortex ( 4 – 7 ). Previous analyses of single adult human neurons has been dependent on methods compatible with freshly isolated neurosurgical tissues ( 8 ), which can be difficult to obtain, with limited regional sampling and depth. By contrast, post-mortem tissues provide a vastly more accessible source of both normal and diseased brain, wherein challenges to interrogating single neuronal genomes can be overcome using single nuclei ( 9 , 10 ) combined with RNA sequencing. Here, we report the development of a scalable pipeline from post-mortem brain through nuclear transcriptome analyses that identifies both known and novel neuronal subtypes across the cerebral cortex in humans.

With the goal of defining transcriptomic profiles of single neurons, neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) was used ( 9 ) to isolate neuronal nuclei ( Fig. S1 ) from the post-mortem brain of a normal, 51-year old female ( Fig. 1A ). We focused on six classically defined Brodmann Areas (BAs) with well-documented anatomical and electrophysiological properties that were derived from a single cortical hemisphere, since inter-hemispheric and inter-individual transcriptome differences were reported to be minimal ( 4 – 7 ). Isolation of nuclei was used to reduce transcriptomic contamination from other cells or degradation encountered with whole-neuron dissociation or laser caption micro-dissection ( Fig. S2 ). Furthermore, sequencing of RNA from single nuclei on a limited scale has found gene expression values comparable to that of the whole cell ( 11 , 12 ). Therefore, we developed and implemented a highly-scalable, single nucleus RNA sequencing (SNS) pipeline ( 13 ) ( Fig. 1A , Fig. S1 , Fig. S3–S8 ) that has broad applicability for post-mortem brains derived from multiple brain banks/repositories ( Fig. S4F ).

Using this pipeline, we processed 86 Fluidigm C1 chips and sequenced 4,488 single nuclei to an average depth of 8.34M reads ( Table S1 , Fig. S5 ). Genomic mapping rates revealed a high proportion of reads that corresponded to intronic sequences ( Fig. 1A , Fig. S5A ). The low percentage of intergenic reads argues against possible genomic contamination. Instead, the intronic reads likely captured an abundance of nascent RNA transcripts present in the nuclei. Intronic reads can be used to predict de novo expression ( 14 ), as well as whole cell gene transcription levels ( 15 ). Additionally, our single nuclei expression data inclusive of intronic reads accurately predicted cellular identity ( Fig. S7 ), thereby providing initial validation for our SNS pipeline.

After quality filtering, including removal of doublets misclassified as single nuclei ( 13 ) ( Fig. 1A , Fig. S6 ), we achieved 3,227 data sets across the six cortical regions ( Fig. 1A , Table S2 ). To identify neuronal subtypes, we developed a clustering and classification strategy that was capable of resolving 17 clusters ( 13 ) ( Fig. S8A ) on the basis of differential expression of neuronally annotated marker genes ( Tables S3–S4 , Fig. S8B ). These clusters showed distinct subgroup aggregation ( Fig. 1B , Fig. S9A ) and unique gene expression profiles associated with neuronal ontologies ( Fig. 1C , Fig. S9B , Tables S5–S6 ). With the exception of a single cluster (NoN, n=44) deriving from one C1 chip having reduced mapping rates, 16 of these clusters were generated independent of detectable batch effects ( Table S2 , Fig. S10 ). Differential expression of inhibitory markers associated with GABAergic interneurons ( Table S3 ) distinguished potential inhibitory (In) from excitatory (Ex) neuronal subtypes ( Fig. 1B ), consistent with mutually exclusive positivity of associated marker genes using a fraction of positive thresholding method ( 2 ) ( Fig. 2A ). As such, our dataset first differentiated two major classifications within the cerebral cortex: 972 inhibitory neurons that generally encompass interneurons and 2,253 excitatory neurons that generally encompass pyramidal or projection neurons ( 16 ). Furthermore, each subgroup within these classifications showed distinct contributions from each brain region ( Fig. 2A , Table S7 ), likely reflecting varied proportions of these neuronal subtypes across BAs, with most variability present in the visual cortex (BA17) that is known to have distinct cytoarchitecture and gene expression profiles ( 7 , 17 ).

In order to further annotate inhibitory neuron subtypes, we examined expression of known marker genes associated with cortical layers, developmental origin, and interneuron classification ( 13 ) ( Fig. 2B ). On the basis of in situ human brain expression data ( Fig. S11 ) ( 17 ), our inhibitory neuron subtypes were found to distribute spatially from the pial surface (most superficial boundary) to white matter (deepest boundary) of the neocortex, and could be grouped by the developmental origin of interneurons from subcortical regions of the medial, lateral, or caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE or CGE) ( Fig. 2B ) ( 18 , 19 ). Furthermore, distinct profiles of interneuron classification markers revealed subtypes that parallel those identified from the mouse somatosensory cortex ( 3 ) ( Fig. 2B–C , Fig. S12A ). Cortical regional heterogeneity within subtypes was also observed, as evident by a layer 3 population (In4) that showed a specific absence of RELN/SST expression in BA17 ( Fig. 2C , Fig. S11B, D ). As such, our data distinguished inhibitory neuron subtypes having heterogeneous distributions within the neocortex.

Most excitatory cortical projection or pyramidal neurons can be categorized by their layer position established during neocortical development ( 17 ) combined with their axonal projections ( 16 ) ( Fig. 3A ). Our excitatory neuron subgroups, which were also in high concordance with subtypes identified in mice ( 3 ) ( Fig. S12B ), expressed known markers associated with a superficial-to-deep cortical distribution ( 13 ) ( Fig. 3B–D , Fig. S13 ), with more than one subtype occupying most layers. Our data set was able to resolve cortical region specificity, as seen for the BHLHE22 positive ( Fig. 3C , Fig. S13A,D ) layer 4 subtypes Ex2 and Ex3 ( Fig. 4A ), where Ex2 derived predominantly from rostral regions, BA8 and BA10, and Ex3 from caudal regions, BA17 and BA41/42 ( Fig. 2A , Fig. 4B ). Consistently, these subgroups showed distinct gene expression ( Fig. 4C , Table S8 ) associated with neuronal electrophysiology and connectivity ( Table S9 ). Furthermore, we were able to resolve intra-subtype heterogeneity, in terms of BA-specific expression patterns, which was observed in all subtypes ( Fig. 4B ), as for example within the Ex3 subtype between BA17 and BA41/42 regions ( Fig. 4B,D ; Table S10 ). As such, regional neurophysiological differences in cortical regions may be attributed to not only variations in the proportions of interneuron and projection neuron subtypes, but also to cell-intrinsic transcriptomic differences amongst single neurons within a subtype. Consistent with this possibility, we found genes having known variability between the visual and temporal cortices from in situ hybridization (ISH) studies ( 17 ) also had transcriptomic differences that could be attributed to subtypes defined by our data set ( 13 ) ( Fig. S14A , Table S11 ). Therefore, our data highlight subtle yet region-defining gene expression signatures amongst specific neuronal subtypes that could not be detected from bulk analyses ( Fig. S14B ).

To further understand the extent of heterogeneity that may exist within subtypes, we identified genes varying globally ( Table S12 , Fig. S15A ) or expressed differentially within each BA ( Table S13 , Fig. S15B ) for each subgroup. While a subset of In and Ex subgroup-variable genes were associated with differential expression between brain regions, a large proportion were unique ( Fig. S15C ). Therefore, the potential exists for not only intra-regional cortical transcriptomic differences, but also further intra-subtype heterogeneity. This might reflect a technical need for increased sampling depth for further subtype resolution, yet may also indicate the potential for even more diversity within subtypes associated with a broader range of individualized neuronal activities. Consistent with these observations, proportions of subgroup variable genes were associated with neuronal subtype classification, post-synaptic function and known regional expression variability ( Fig. S15C ). These data support further local and regional functional heterogeneity existing amongst defined subtypes.

Our results demonstrate that post-mortem SNS can identify expected and novel neuronal subtypes that provide insight into brain function through distinct profiles of activity defining genes ( Fig. S16 , Table S14 ). Furthermore, given that only a very small subset of layer specific markers used in our analyses ( CARTPT, CHRNA7, PDYN, RELN ) were found to have ISH differences between individual donors ( 17 ), our subtypes can be expected to be globally representative. Indeed, our subtypes remain highly conserved in mice ( 3 ), with differences highlighting evolutionary changes in potential orthologues ( Fig. S12 ). Our data sets reveal shared gene expression signatures that can distinguish subtypes and regional identity, supporting a transcriptional basis for well-known differences in cortical cytoarchitecture. Additional heterogeneity found within single neuronal transcriptomes may further reflect activities of complex neuronal networks that vary with function and time, as well as underlying genomic mosaicism that exists in human cortical neurons ( 10 , 20 – 23 ). Our study thus lays the groundwork for high-throughput global human brain transcriptome mapping using nuclei derived from readily available post-mortem tissues for analyses of normal individuals, as assessed here, as well as myriad diseases of brain and mind.
