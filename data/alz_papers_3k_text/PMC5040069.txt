Increased 4R-tau induces pathological changes in a human-tau mouse model

# Abstract
Pathological evidence for selective four repeat (4R) tau deposition in certain dementias and exon 10-positioned MAPT mutations together suggest a 4R-specific role in causing disease. However, direct assessments of 4R toxicity have not yet been accomplished in vivo. Increasing 4R-tau expression without change to total tau in human tau-expressing mice induced more severe seizures and nesting behavior abnormality, increased tau phosphorylation, and produced a shift toward oligomeric tau. Exon 10-skipping could also be accomplished in vivo , providing support for a 4R-tau targeted approach to target 4R-tau toxicity and, in cases of primary MAPT mutation, eliminate the disease-causing mutation.

## INTRODUCTION
Cognitive disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and primary tauopathies are typified by the abnormal intracellular deposition of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau can be expressed with three repeat domains (3R) or four (4R), which arise from alternative splicing of MAPT exon 10 mRNA. Normal adult humans express approximately equal 3R- and 4R-tau; however, select sporadic tauopathies exhibit an imbalance of 4R-tau isoform deposition within neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) ( Arai et al., 2001 , de Silva et al., 2003 ). In patients with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), mutations identified within MAPT exon/intron 10 result in an abnormal increase in 4R-tau expression without disruption of its microtubule binding characteristics ( D’Souza et al., 1999 , Hong et al., 1998 ).

While some in vitro studies demonstrate that 4R-tau or an altered isoform ratio induces tau aggregation ( Adams et al., 2010 , von Bergen et al., 2001 ), testing 3R- versus 4R-tau toxicity in animal models has been challenging because mice do not recapitulate human 4R:3R ratios and different transgenes are not directly comparable. We developed tau isoform switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) ( DeVos and Miller, 2013a ) for use in hTau mice, which lack endogenous mouse tau and express mostly 3R human tau ( Andorfer et al., 2003 ) without early onset behavioral deficits or tau pathology ( Polydoro et al., 2009 ). By comparing mice of the same genetic background but greater ASO-driven 4R-tau, we were able to test whether increased 4R-tau led to increased pathology and changes in behavior. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of a 4R reducing therapeutic approach using ASOs.

## RESULTS
In order to test whether 4R-tau is a prime mediator of tauopathy, we developed ASOs that target human MAPT mRNA to increase the 4R:3R tau ratio. hTau mice were treated with continuous intraventricular infusion of saline, scrambled ASO, or 3R-to-4R MAPT mRNA splicing ASO for 28 days via osmotic pump. One month following cessation of infusion, mRNA analysis revealed a nearly 2-fold increase in 4R human MAPT mRNA with splicing ASO treatment (n=19) compared to saline- or scrambled ASO-treated mice (n=9/group; p<0.005 vs. saline and scrambled controls, Figure 1A ). Importantly, there was no alteration of total human tau ( Figure 1B, C ), indicative of an isoform switch rather than a 4R-tau increase alone. ASO-mediated MAPT alteration also occurred in the absence of off-target binding ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). 4R, 3R, and total tau protein expression closely corresponded to MAPT mRNA levels revealing an increase in 4R-tau and decrease in 3R-tau following 3R to 4R splicing treatment ( Figure 1D ) with similar total tau levels ( Figure 1E, F ).

3R to 4R splicing ASO-treated hTau mice were evaluated for tau phosphorylation using the AT8 antibody, which detects S202/T205 phosphorylation events and is frequently associated with tau pathology ( Braak and Braak, 1995 ). Following scrambled ASO treatment (n=5), faint neuronal AT8 immunoreactivity was identified within the entorhinal cortex ( Figure 2A ), amygdala ( Figure 2D ), and throughout the cortex ( Figure 2G ). However, with 3R to 4R splicing ASO treatment (n=7), the area of positive immunoreactivity increased ( Figure 2B, E, H ), showing significantly higher percentages of staining within select areas (p<0.05; Figure 2C, F, I ). Exacerbated AT8 reactivity within known regions of tau spread throughout the brain may be predictive of increased pathological tau burden with greater 4R-tau expression.

Tau aggregation into larger, more insoluble species is also a characteristic of fibrillar structures and increasing toxicity ( Spillantini and Goedert, 2013 ). Therefore, cortical brain tissue from 12-month-old hTau mice treated with scrambled ASO (n=3) or 3R to 4R splicing ASO (n=4) was analyzed for high molecular weight (HMW) tau forms. Greater tau reactivity was evident within HMW regions with 3R to 4R splicing ASO treatment compared to controls ( Figure 2J ). Not only was this result indicative of aggregated tau proteins with increased 4R-tau, but also regions of HMW tau were determined to be more heavily phosphorylated (p<0.05; Figure 2K , Supplementary Figure S2 ). To further confirm 4R-tau driven pathology, soluble and insoluble tau species were identified by fractionation analysis of cortical brain tissue from treated hTau mice. While the majority of tau within hTau mice was found within the RAB-soluble fraction, increased 4R-tau was associated with a moderate increase RIPA-soluble tau indicating a decline in solubility ( Figure 2L ). Insoluble tau detected within the formic acid fraction did not change. Human-tau specific ELISA analysis mirrored the increase in RIPA-soluble tau ( Figure 2M ). Both SDD-AGE and fractionation results are consistent with phosphorylated tau histology, collectively suggesting human tau is becoming more phosphorylated, aggregated, and less soluble with increased 4R-tau expression.

Emerging evidence strongly suggests a role for tau in modulating synaptic activity. Tau reduction, both genetically ( Ittner et al., 2010 , Roberson et al., 2007 ) and by ASO ( DeVos et al., 2013 ), reduced seizure severity following pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection. At 4 months, hTau mice were treated with saline, scrambled ASO, or 3R to 4R splicing ASO infusion (n=18–19/treatment) and, one month later, injected with PTZ to evoke a generalized seizure. Saline and scrambled ASO-treated mice were not statistically significant (mean seizure stage 3.64 ± 2.29 vs. 4.00 ± 2.70 standard deviation, respectively) and, therefore, combined for analyses. Compared to control treatments, 3R to 4R splicing ASO-treated hTau mice experienced significantly more severe seizures (p<0.05; Figure 3A ) and reached more severe seizure stages faster than controls (p<0.05; Figure 3B ). Despite the absence of overt synaptic or neuronal changes ( Supplementary Figure S3 ), these data strongly suggest that increasing 4R-tau worsens functional outcome in mice by either predisposing mice to seizure activity or exacerbating hyperexcitability.

The natural behavior of nest building in mice has been used to assess impairment with AD and tauopathy ( Torres-Lista and Gimenez-Llort, 2013 , Maeda et al., 2016 ) and can be quantified based on published criteria ( Figure 3A ). Compared to male hTau mice treated with either saline or scrambled ASO (n=4), hTau mice given 3R to 4R splicing ASO (n=5) exhibited significantly lower nestlet scores (p<0.05; Figure 3B ) and greater weights of untorn nestlet (p<0.05; Figure 3C ), implicating increased 4R-tau in impaired nesting ability.

Our data and others suggest 4R-tau to be more toxic, yet, to date, no tau splicing strategy has been implemented in vivo despite the overwhelming number of tau mutations within exon 10. In order to validate the use of an exon skipping strategy in humans, we developed ASOs designed to exclude exon 10, thus decreasing 4R-tau without change to total tau levels, to test in hTau mice. Compared to saline treatment (n=3), hTau mice that received 4R to 3R splicing ASO (n=3) exhibited a robust decrease in exon 10 inclusion within the cortex (p<0.005), hippocampus (p<0.05), and spinal cord (p<0.005; Figure 4A ). Total tau levels remained unchanged ( Figure 4B ). To further address the efficacy and feasibility of a 4R to 3R splicing strategy, we applied this exon 10-skipping strategy to mice that recapitulate FTDP-17 tauopathy with mutant (TauN279K) 4R-tau overexpression ( Dawson et al., 2007 ). Intraventricular administration of 4R to 3R splicing ASO resulted in a substantial decrease in 4R human MAPT mRNA concomitant with an increase in 3R MAPT mRNA compared to controls (p<0.05; Figure 4C ). Again, total tau levels were not altered following ASO treatment ( Figure 4D ) with clear selectively toward human MAPT mRNA ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Thus, antisense-mediated 4R to 3R MAPT splicing is effective in full-length human tau-expressing mice, lending support for the feasibility of a 4R isoform target in human dementias.

## DISCUSSION
In hTau mice treated with ASO to increase 4R-tau, we identified a significant increase in phosphorylated tau and more aggregated, less soluble tau species. Seizures were both more severe and occurred at earlier time points with increased 4R-tau in hTau mice. While it is possible an imbalanced ratio of 4R- to 3R-tau or other off-target toxicity may have led to increased pathology, it remains likely that 4R-tau is more pathogenic. This is consistent with previous reports citing mitochondrial axonal transport defects ( Stoothoff et al., 2009 ), microtubule instability ( Bunker et al., 2004 ), and increased polymerization ( Combs et al., 2011 ) of 4R-tau compared to 3R-tau. These altered characteristics may be key to the selective deposition of 4R-tau in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration, and FTDP-17; however, other factors may influence the 3R-tau deposition seen in Pick’s disease and the mixed deposition of both 3R- and 4R-tau in AD.

We also show in vivo application of the converse ASO approach by lowering 4R-tau in two mouse models of human tau expression. To date, nearly half of the 53 known MAPT mutations are located within exon/intron 10 ( Ghetti et al., 2015 ) and account for 70% of the total number of published families affected by MAPT mutations ( Cruts et al., 2012 ). The 4R to 3R splicing ASO strategy described here would not only change 4R- to 3R-tau, but also remove the exon 10-containing amino acid missense mutation in the mature protein, without changing the total levels of tau. For PSP and other 4R-tauopathies without a primary tau mutation, exon 10 skipping may also be an advantageous therapy since 4R-tau selectively deposits and is predicted to more readily seed 4R-tau ( Dinkel et al., 2011 , Sanders et al., 2014 ). Both exon 10-containing alleles would be targeted by our current ASO approach, although the concept of mutant allele-specific targeting has been successful in other models ( Hu et al., 2009 , Miller et al., 2003 ).

Overall, these data provide compelling evidence for the presence of tau isoform-mediated neurodegeneration and introduce exon 10-targeted ASOs that may be an effective therapy for tauopathies. A similar ASO-mediated exon skipping strategy has been successfully employed in Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (DMD). Exon skipping of a nonsense mutation restored dystrophin expression and improved motor function in mdx dystrophic mouse ( Lu et al., 2003 ), leading to a dystrophin-targeting ASO (drisapersen) clinical trial in human DMD patients (GlaxoSmithKline). The bench to the bedside success of exon skipping in DMD in addition to the excellent safety profile of centrally-delivered ASO for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Miller et al., 2013 ) and spinal muscular atrophy (Ionis Pharmaceuticals) emphasizes the promise of other ASO-mediated splicing strategies for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Alternative tau-targeted approaches, including tau clearance and total tau reduction, show promise for therapeutic applications, but do not address the individual effect of tau isoforms in mediating tauopathies. And, in contrast to a total tau reduction approach, a MAPT splicing strategy would not affect total tau levels, thereby avoiding potential subtle or unforeseen confounds associated with a loss of tau ( Lei et al., 2012 , Ma et al., 2014 , Dawson et al., 2010 ). In order to advance MAPT splicing ASOs toward human clinical trials, additional information will be necessary, including evaluation in preclinical tauopathy models, greater understanding of the 3R and 4R mRNA and protein composition in human tauopathies and insight on what causes selective 4R deposition. Our experiments provide initial support for an ASO therapeutic strategy in primary tau mutations and potentially other 4R tauopathies.

## EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Male and female hTau transgenic ( Andorfer et al., 2003 ; RRID: IMSR_JAX: 005491) or Tau N279K transgenic mice ( Dawson et al., 2007 ) and their non-transgenic littermates were aged to 3–4 months prior to experimental treatment with the exception of biochemical and phosphorylated tau analyses in hTau mice (4 or 12 months of age). Ages/genders were matched across treatment groups. All husbandry and surgical procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee in accordance with federal standards. For more details on the animals used, refer to Supplemental Information .

Splicing ASOs were designed with a phosphorothioate backbone, uniformly modified with 2′- O -methoxyethyl nucleotides to enhance binding to the MAPT target and prevent RNaseH-mediated degradation of MAPT mRNA ( DeVos and Miller, 2013a ). A scrambled ASO control, designed with the same modifications as the MAPT splicing ASO but without target specificity, was included in experimental treatments to account for any potential toxicity or off-target effects of the ASO backbone. All ASOs were synthesized by Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA) and generously provided for use. ASO sequence information can be found in Supplemental Information .

ASOs were continuously administered to the right lateral ventricle via osmotic pump (ALZET, Cupertino, CA) as previously described ( DeVos and Miller, 2013b ). For a detailed surgical procedure and osmotic pump preparation, see Supplemental Information .

Mice were euthanized by transcardial perfusion with cold heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and decapitated. The right brain, ipsilateral to the catheter placement, was microdissected into temporoparietal and occipital regions (~15–30 mg), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until processin g. The left brain was drop fixed into 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h followed by dehydration in 30% sucrose. Tissue was then frozen in −35°C to −25°C methylbutanes and sto red at −80°C until sectioning for histology.

mRNA was isolated from temporoparietal right hemi-brain tissue. Total and MAPT isoform mRNA from hTau mice was readily detectable by standard quantitative real-time PCR methods. A modified RT-PCR protocol was used to amplify and detect human 3R and 4R MAPT isoforms in Tau N279K mice. Detailed methodology, including primer and probe sequences, are included under Supplemental Information .

Right hemi-brain tissue designated for protein analysis was homogenized and prepared for analysis by ELISA and immunoblot as described in Supplemental Information .

Semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) was carried out as previously described ( Sanders et al., 2014 , Halfmann and Lindquist, 2008 ) with minor modifications (see Supplemental Information ).

Left hemi-brain tissue from treated hTau mice was used for immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated tau. Procedures, antibody information, and analyses are detailed in Supplemental Information .

Seizure activity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of the GABA receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, Sigma), at a dose of 55 mg/kg and analyzed as previously published ( DeVos et al., 2013 ) and further described in Supplemental Information .

Following the nocturnal period, untorn nesting material was weighed and nests were photographed for scoring on a 0 to 7 ordinal scale modified from published criteria ( Deacon, 2006 , Gheyara et al., 2014 ) to assess both the percentage of chewed nestlet and shape of the nest. Additional detail has been provided in Supplemental Information .

Data were graphed as mean ± SEM and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 statistical software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Individual statistical tests are described within Supplemental Information .
