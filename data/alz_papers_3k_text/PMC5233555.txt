Structural Variation in Amyloid-β Fibrils from Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Subtypes

# Abstract
Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. 1 – 12 Recent experiments 1 , 13 – 16 suggest that variations in Aβ fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in AD phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. 17 – 19 Here we have investigated correlations between structural variation and AD phenotype using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of AD brain cortex. We compared two atypical AD clinical subtypes, rapidly progressive AD (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD), with typical prolonged duration AD (t-AD). Based on ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from t-AD and PCA-AD patients, while Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures, and suggest a qualitative difference between Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates in AD brain tissue.

## Extended Data
( a ) TEM grids were prepared 4 h after addition of solubilized Aβ40 or Aβ42 to sonicated brain extract and were negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Collagen fibrils in the extract (40–100 nm width, with characteristic transverse bands) appear in some images. Material with an amorphous appearance is nonfibrillar, non-Aβ components of the brain extract. Yellow arrows indicate Aβ40 fibrils with an apparent width modulation, attributable to an approximately periodic twisting of the fibril structure about the fibril growth direction. TEM images of all 37 brain-seeded Aβ40 and all 33 Aβ42 fibril samples are available on-line at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/whgp9r7tkd.1 . ( b ) Histogram of distances between width minima for Aβ40 fibrils with apparent width modulation. The Gaussian fit to this histogram (red curve) has a mean value of 107.2 nm (n = 65) and a full-width-at-half-maximum of 46.1 nm.

a, Examples of 2D spectra (out of the 29 Aβ40 and 15 Aβ42 spectra with adequate signal-to-noise in Table 1 ), with fitted crosspeak positions indicated by crosses. Red and blue crosses indicate crosspeaks for chemical shift sets “a” and “b”, respectively (see Supplementary Methods , Supplementary Discussion , and Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Cyan crosses indicate additional crosspeaks. Contour levels increase by successive factors of 1.4. b, Pairwise differences among fitted crosspeak volumes for spectra of Aβ40 fibrils (left) and Aβ42 fibrils (right), with color scales representing RMSD values. Total crosspeak volumes in each spectrum were normalized before calculation of RMSD values. Results from this crosspeak-fitting analysis are similar to results in Fig. 3 , in which the same experimental data were analyzed by direct comparisons of signal amplitudes in 2D spectra without fitting the signals with crosspeaks at specific positions. c, Fractions of the total fitted crosspeak volumes at “a” and “b” chemical shifts, with mean values indicated by horizontal bars. For Aβ40, mean values of “a” volumes in spectra of t-AD (n = 12) or PCA-AD (n = 6) samples are significantly greater than the mean value (n = 10) in spectra of r-AD samples (p < 0.02, Welch’s t-test; p < 0.02, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test).

a, 15 N and 13 C chemical shifts (ppm) from spectra of brain-seeded samples in Table 1 (grouped into sets “a”, “b”, etc., based on correlations of the corresponding signal amplitudes over multiple 2D spectra) are compared with chemical shifts from previous ssNMR studies of Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils, as deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank with the indicated BMRB accession numbers. b, Chemical shift differences after adjustments of chemical shift referencing in each set to make the average 13 C α shifts and the average 15 N shifts equal in all sets.

a, From Fig. 3 , mean RMSD values for pairs of 2D spectra within a given tissue category are compared with mean RMSD values between tissue categories or within a different tissue category. The significance of differences in mean RMSD values is assessed by Welch’s t-test (two-sided). b, From Fig. 4 , mean values of coefficients of the second principal component in 2D spectra (C 2 ) from three tissue categories are compared. The significance of differences in mean C 2 values is assessed by Welch’s t-test (two-sided).
