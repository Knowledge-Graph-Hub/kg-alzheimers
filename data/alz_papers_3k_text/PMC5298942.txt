Locus coeruleus volume and cell population changes during Alzheimer’s disease progression: a stereological study in human postmortem brains with potential implication for early-stage biomarker discovery

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression follows a specific spreading pattern, emphasizing the need to characterize those brain areas that degenerate first. The brainstem’s locus coeruleus (LC) is the first area to develop neurofibrillary changes (NFT). Unbiased stereological analyses in human brainstems to estimate LC volume and neuronal population in controls and individuals across all AD stages. As the Braak stage increases by 1 unit, the LC volume decreases by 8.4%. Neuronal loss started only midway through AD progression. Age-related changes spare the LC. The long gap between NFT accumulation and neuronal loss suggests that a second trigger may be necessary to induce neuronal death in AD. Imaging studies should determine whether LC volumetry can replicate the stage-wise atrophy observed here and how these changes are specific to AD. LC volumetry may develop into a screening biomarker for selecting high-yield candidates to undergo expensive and less accessible PET-scans and to monitor AD progression from pre-symptomatic stages.

## 1. Introduction
The UN projects that more than 200 million people will suffer from neurodegenerative diseases by 2050. In the USA alone, the cost of dementia is over $160 billion a year and is projected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2050 [ 1 ]. Effective disease-modifying treatments for AD remain elusive. In recent years, all promising therapies for AD that appeared efficacious in animal models fell short when tested in humans [ 2 ]. Oversimplification and incomplete modeling of AD pathophysiology are, at least partly, to blame for this failure [ 3 ]. AD features double-nature lesions. Besides accumulation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal loss plays a critical role [ 4 ]. If fact, neuronal loss is considered the best correlate of cognitive deterioration in AD [ 5 ]. Furthermore, AD follows a predictable anatomical sequence, with lesions spreading along specific neuronal pathways [ 6 ]. Understanding the pathobiology of AD in the brain areas that degenerate first is critical for developing treatments to halt the spread of AD before it causes an irrevocable neuronal loss. Braak and Braak (BB) designed a universally used 7-point system for staging AD that recapitulates the stereotypical spreading pattern of tau cytoskeletal pathology in the cortex [ 7 ]. NFTs limited to transentorhinal/entorhinal cortex and hippocampus represent stages I/II. In 2009, our group demonstrated that tau cytoskeletal pathology in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a serotonin-producing nucleus in the midbrain, preceds the development of NFTs in transentorhinal cortex [ 8 ]. Re-examination of the temporal involvement of subcortical structures in AD followed [ 9 , 10 ], including Braak’s group revision of their classical staging system in 2011 which now incorporates brainstem structures as precortical staging a-c [ 11 ]. They demonstrated that the locus ceruleus (LC), a noradrenergic nucleus located at the pons, shows NFTs as early as the fourth decade of life, corroborating previous findings of early LC involvement in AD [ 12 – 14 ]. The LC belongs to the isodendritic core, a phylogenetically conserved nuclei network [ 14 ]. NFT development in components of the isodendritic core consistently precedes NFTs in any cortical areas [ 8 , 10 , 11 ].

Understanding the changes in LC associated with AD progression may represent a window of opportunity for identifying biomarkers to detect AD in prodromal stages and inform on therapeutic targets to halt AD progression. Meticulous neuropathological investigations that could be criticized as “descriptive” were critical for creating the necessary foundation for further studies utilizing cutting-edge methods such as proteomics, high-resolution imaging, and improved animal models that advance the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. Aiming to understand the impact of AD in the LC, we utilized design-based stereology to investigate LC volume and neuronal population changes in a sample of 68 subjects, enriched for controls and early AD stages.

## 2. Participants and methods
The majority of the cases (65) was sourced from the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Brain Aging Study Group (BBBABSG [ 15 , 16 ]). The Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank (NDBB) from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) supplied three cases (#62, 63, 68; Table 1 ). The institutional review boards of both participating institutions approved this study. The BBBABSG is supplied by the São Paulo City Autopsy Service (SPAS). Autopsies are mandatory for determining the cause of death in Sao Paulo and the SPAS performs approximately 13,000 autopsies are performed per year. All cases autopsied during morning hours are candidates for the BBBABSG after donation by next-of-kin [ 15 ]. The BBBABSG receives approximately 300 cases per year. A random rotation list among the studies supplied by the BBBABSG was created to accommodate all the studies requiring a modified protocol, including this one. For the current study, we received cases collected from 2010 to 2013. The NDBB receives brain and spinal cord donations from patients enrolled in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. The great majority of UCSF/NDBB cases developed late-stage dementia, and most of the cases show more than one neurodegenerative condition. We collected the first three consecutive cases meeting the study criteria. The selection criteria for both centers included the absence of non-AD related neurodegenerative pathology or significant cerebrovascular lesions and availability of an intact brainstem. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of seizures, other neurological diseases, a primary Axis 1 psychiatric diagnosis, or gross non-degenerative structural pathology. For all cases, the neuropathological assessment was based on analysis of dementia-related structures embedded in paraffin wax, cut into 8-micron thick sections, and stained with immunohistochemistry. BBBABSG and NDBB neuropathological protocols are similar. AD pathology was staged according to the new NIA-AA guidelines [ 17 ]. Cases were categorized by the BB staging system for neurofibrillary changes [ 7 ]. Subjects were considered to be BB stage 0 or free of cortical NFTs when at least 4 sections across the transentorhinal cortex were negative for phospho-tau immunostaining (CP-13, gift of Peter Davies) [ 8 ]. Approximately 500 cases were screened for this study.

The tissue processing and staining methods used in this study have been previously described [ 18 ]. Briefly, each brainstem block was separated from the brain, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in 8% celloidin for subsequent sectioning [ 19 ]. Blocks were sectioned horizontally in serial sets, each one containing one 300-μm thick and five 60-μm thick sections. For cytoarchitectonic visualization of the LC, all odd-numbered sections were stained with gallocyanin-chromalum. Parallel sections were immunostained for phospho-tau (CP-13) after antigen retrieval [ 18 ]. Selected sections were immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:00, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for assisting with the LC border segmentation [ 18 ]( Figure 1 ).

Stereological analyses of unilateral LC neuronal population were performed using the optical fractionator probe of the StereoInvestigator software (MBF StereoInvestigator v.10, MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) [ 18 ]. LC borders were traced based on the Atlas of the Cytoarchitecture of the Human Brain Stem [ 20 ]: the LC lies rostrally in the caudal portion of the inferior colliculus and ends caudally to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nucleus. We segmented the LC volume and estimated the neuronal population on the gallocyanin-stained thick sections. This stain allowed for a precise and consistent identification of the LC boarders, and the inclusion of non-TH positive mid- and large-size neurons. We estimated the neuronal population of the left LC in 63 cases ( Tab. 1 ) using a 40× magnification objective (Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.30 oil objective, Zeiss) in all odd-numbered sections (~20–25) crossing the LC. Optimal stereological parameters were determined using the ‘resample-oversample’ analysis probes included in the StereoInvestigator software. Based on the output [ 18 ], we adopted a 13,828.1 μm 2 counting frame area and 421,515.0 μm 2 sampling grid area. The guard zone was established at 20 μm and dissector height at 90 μm. The coefficient of error (CE) range was calculated following Gundersen’s and Schmitz-Hof’s methods [ 21 , 22 ]. All pigmented and non-pigmented mid- and large-size neurons were included in the estimations. We used a BB 0 case to estimate the proportion of pigmented neurons using the same parameters.

The unilateral LC volumes were calculated for the 68 cases using the Cavalieri principle and the planimetry probe of the StereoInvestigator software, following manual delineation of the LC borders. For detecting a possible topographical gradient of vulnerability to AD across the disease progression, we subdivided the LC into equal rostral, middle, and caudal segments.

The association of BB stage with the total LC population counts and volumes, and region-specific counts and volumes, were assessed using linear regression models, associated scatterplots, and lowess curves [ 23 ]. Scatterplots of LC volumes versus BB stage indicated that volumes varied linearly with BB stage. Therefore, we fitted regression models that included as predictors a linear term for BB stage, as well as age, gender and brain weight as potential confounding variables. The regression coefficient of BB stage in these models assessed the change in volume associated with an increase of one BB stage. The LC population counts versus BB stage exhibited a curvature that was accommodated by including linear and quadratic BB stage terms in the regression models. The models also included age, gender, and brain weight as potential confounding variables. In the quadratic models, the change in LC population counts associated with an increase of one BB stage depended on the stage. Thus, BB-stage-specific rates of change in LC population counts were calculated using the estimated derivative of the quadratic curve with respect to BB stage, along with associated 95% confidence intervals. The association of age with total LC population counts and volumes among the subjects in BB stages 0-I was assessed using linear regression models. LC population counts and volumes versus age indicated that both outcomes varied linearly with age, therefore we fit regression models that included as predictors a linear term for age, as well as BB stage, gender, and brain weight as potential confounding variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata software package (Stata Statistical Software v13, StataCorp, TX). In all tests, p < 0.05 denoted a significant difference.

## 3. Results
Table 1 summarizes demographics, morphological data, and cognitive status of all cases (47% females; mean age at death: 62.8 ± 10.3 years, range 44 to 96 years old).

LC volume varied from 5.8 to 21.7 mm 3 (mean: 12.8 mm 3 ) and showed no significant gender differences ( Figure 1C–D ). Unadjusted linear regression models indicate a statistically significant correlation between a higher BB stage and smaller LC volume (β = −0.853; p<0.001; 95% coefficient interval (CI): [−1.27, −0.43]) Adjustment for gender, age, years of education, and brain weight increased the magnitude of the estimated regression coefficient to a β = −1.078 with p<0.001 and 95% CI: [−1.6, −0.6] ( Figure 2A ), which signifies as the BB stage increases by 1 unit, the average LC volume decreases by 1.08 mm 3 , or 8.4% ( Figure 2A ). Significant volume reductions were also observed for each LC subregion (63 cases; Table 1 ). The magnitudes of the regression coefficients for rostral and middle LC were −0.407 (p<0.001; 95% CI: [−0.6, −0.2]) and −0.483 (p<0.001; 95% CI: [−0.7, −0.2]) per increment of BB stage, respectively, whereas the caudal part showed a smaller coefficient of −0.175 (p=0.031; 95% CI: [−0.3, −0.2]). Following adjustments, the coefficient values increased to −0.436 (p=0.001; 95% CI: [−0.7, −0.2]), −0.556 (p<0.001; 95% CI: [−0.8, −0.2]) and −0.193 (p=0.045; 95% CI: [−0.4, −0.0]) respectively ( Figure 2B–D ).

Unbiased stereological estimates of the total LC cell population ranged between 6,674 to 137,910 cells (mean: 48,907 cells). The average CE was 0.07 for both the Gundersen’s and Schmitz-Hof’s methods, indicating high sampling precision [ 21 , 22 ]. Pigmented neurons corresponded to 46% of the total mid- and large-size LC cell population ( Figure 3 ). Analyses adjusted for age, gender, years of education, and brain weight indicated relatively stable total LC population estimates in BB stages 0–II, with no statistical differences to BB 0 at 95% confidence intervals ( Figure 4A ). On the other hand, the rates of change in stages BB III–VI were negative and statistically significant.

The same pattern observed for the total LC neuronal population was seen in the rostral, middle, and caudal portions ( Figure 4B–D ). For the rostral LC neuronal population ( Figure 4B ), the rate of change at stage III was negative, but not statistically significant at the 5% level.

To address if the differences observed in the LC could be partly attributed to age-related processes, we compared estimated LC volume and neuronal population in the subset of individuals at BB stages 0 and I (n=40; all CDR=0; 17 females; age range: 47–83 years; Table 1 ). Linear regression models using age as the primary predictor, along with gender and brain weight as potential confounding variables, showed no significant association between normal aging and changes in the LC ( Figure 5 ).

We assessed the association between the BB stage, LC volume, and neuronal estimates, and demographics using linear regression and correlation analysis. We failed to find any correlation between age, gender, brain weight, or years of education as predictors of changes in LC.

## 4. Discussion
We used unbiased design-based stereology to analyze the LC volume in 68 brainstems and estimate the number of LC neurons in 63 brainstems, distributed through BB stages 0–VI and free from non-AD brain changes. Our observations produced four major findings. First, for each unit increment of the BB staging system the average LC volume reduced by 8.4%, starting in Braak 0. Second, despite this early volumetric shrinkage, the average neuronal dropout started at a much later stage, midway through the AD progression. Third, the caudal LC third showed fewer AD-related changes, suggesting a gradient of vulnerability within the nucleus. Fourth, normal aging did not significantly affect the LC, suggesting that our findings are likely related to the progression of AD pathology.

Anatomically, the LC two columns are located in the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum [ 20 ]. Being the major site of norepinephrine (NE) synthesis in the brain [ 24 ], the LC is crucial for regulating the sleep-wakefulness cycle [ 25 , 26 ], and behavioral responses such as depression and stress [ 27 ]. Studies dating back to the 1960s pointed to the early LC vulnerability to AD [ 12 , 13 , 28 – 31 ]. Furthermore, the importance of LC in AD is highlighted by studies in animal models showing that LC vulnerability to NFT followed by reduced NE availability in the brain mediate neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, cognitive deficits, changes in neuronal metabolism, and blood-brain-barrier permeability in both human and experimental models [ 32 – 34 ]. In fact, we identified phospho-tau positive cytoplasmic inclusions in the LC of all cases, including the 18 cases at BB 0 corroborating previous suggestions that the high proportion depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances seen often in prodromal AD may be mediated by AD changes in the isodendritic core [ 35 , 36 ].

To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies addressing the LC volumetric differences in AD and the first to report a linear volumetric reduction during AD early stages. Hoogendijk et al. reported a 22% LC volume difference between 5 AD and 5 control cases [ 37 ]. Had we dichotomized the cases, our findings would be similar. German et al. also implied that LC shrinks in AD based on dichotomous analyses of 8 AD and 7 controls [ 38 ]. We detected a significant linear decline of LC volume of 8.4% per BB stage increment beginning at the transition from BB 0 to BB I. This volumetric loss was significant in all the LC thirds. Although, a higher number of mid-stage cases would be necessary to clarify the rate of LC volume loss in AD mid-stages, we employed locally weighted regression that describe the local association of each BB stage increment with LC volume. Therefore, the observed decreased in volume between BB stages 0-I and I-II were independent on data in BB stages III-VI. Our findings indicate that LC volume shrinks by an average of 25% before the onset of AD-defining symptoms, which usually coincide with BB stage III. Further studies are necessary to determine the cause of this volumetric shrinkage.

Advances in neuroimaging are enabling in vivo volumetric studies of small brain regions [ 39 ] including the LC [ 40 ]. If imaging volumetry will be able to replicate the stage-wise LC atrophy observed at least in the early stages of AD, and these changes prove to have a high predictive value to AD, LC volumetry may translate into a powerful, scalable, and economic serial screening biomarker to guide workup decisions in AD. Consequently, LC volumetric changes could be the initial screening step required for selecting high-yield candidates to undergo less accessible and more expensive PET-scans. Furthermore, monitoring changes in LC volume may potentially be an end-point parameter for testing the efficacy of interventions against AD at individual level. This would be especially relevant during AD prodromal stages, as a decrease in volume can be probably detected years before the onset of clinical defining symptoms.

We detected a broad variability in LC population estimates within each BB stage ( Figure 4 ) as anticipated from other studies [ 41 ]. Previous studies estimated unilateral LC neuronal population size of 12,000 to 60,000 cells in controls individuals. Several factors may explain the discrepancy among the studies. Unbiased stereological methods are tedious, labor-intense, and, most importantly, rely on the availability of the whole volume of interest. Only a fraction of LC studies employed unbiased stereological methods [ 37 , 42 , 43 ]. Here, using an advanced stereology set-up, it took 1260 hours of counting to estimate the unilateral population size of all LC. To avoid redundant work, we used a oversample-resample approach to set the paraments [ 18 ]. Curiously, when minimally decreasing the sampling size, we obtained over 50% differences in estimations, despite the fact that CE values were acceptable (< 0.1) in both cases. In fact, a low CE is an indicator rather than a guarantee of unbiased estimations[ 22 ]. The neuronal types included in the estimate is another source of discrepancies. We included all mid- and large-size LC neurons, whereas many studies restricted the counts to TH-positive or neuromelanin-bearing neurons [ 31 , 38 , 42 – 46 ]. According to ours and others estimations [ 20 , 44 ], pigmented neurons correspond to approximately 3/5 of the total mid- and large-size LC neurons in controls.

Regardless of the method employed, all studies point to a significant LC neuronal loss in AD [ 14 ]. This study though, innovates by classifying the cases using the 7-point BB staging system rather than in a dichotomized manner, thus informing when in the process the neuronal loss starts. Unexpectedly, despite strong evidence of tau cytoskeletal pathology and a linear LC volume decrease from BB stage 0, differences in LC neuronal population became significant and conspicuous only from BB stage III. In a recent study, Arendt et al. [ 31 ] also reported a delay in significant LC neuronal loss based on 119 LC classified into four clinicopathological groups. Together, our studies point to a large gap between the apparance of tau cytoskeletal pathology and neuronal loss in humans [ 5 ]. It is noteworthy that subject #63 ( Table 1 ; BB stage VI) has less than 1/3 of the average number of neurons than the other BB stage VI cases, despite being younger. This corroborate suggestions that early-onset AD is more aggressive than late-onset AD, despite sharing identical neuropathological hallmarks [ 47 ]. In fact, NFTs and neuritic plaques are not always a surrogate marker of neuronal loss [ 5 ]. Investigations focusing on mechanisms to protect neurons from NFT-related toxicity may potentially disclose relevant targets for disease-modifying treatment [ 48 ]. Experimental studies demonstrating that norepinephrine restoration slows of neurodegeneration, situate the LC as a relevant area to research investigating protective mechanisms against AD [ 49 ]. Similarly, studies in the LC may disclose possible second hit mechanisms necessary to trigger neuronal loss in NFT-bearing neurons.

Agreeing with previous studies [ 37 , 38 , 44 – 46 ], we observed a selective LC topographical vulnerability to AD with the rostral and middle thirds more vulnerable than the caudal third. Again, the novelty here was to identify at which point in the disease process and at what rate this regional neuronal loss happens. Such topographical inhomogeneity in LC vulnerability corroborates a network-based, bi-directional spread of AD [ 50 ]. For instance, unilateral injection of synthetic tau into the LC of young PS19 mice overexpressing mutant human tau induced neuronal loss from the ipsilateral LC, and significant tau pathology in brain regions anatomically connected with the LC. Reversely, synthetic tau injections into cortical regions rapidly induced pathogenesis in the LC [ 51 ]. In rodents and monkeys, the LC rostral and middle parts project to and receive inputs from cortical, diencephalic, and forebrain structures [ 46 , 52 , 53 ], found especially vulnerable to AD in humans. The relatively spared caudal pole is reciprocally connected with regions unaffected in AD, including spinal cord and cerebellum [ 54 ]. These findings also highlight the importance of anatomical precision in tissue sampling for biochemical and molecular studies for avoiding false results.

The brain shows a sub-regional vulnerability to normal aging processes [ 55 ]. To address if aging could be a confounder to our results, we analyzed the LC volume and neuron population size of the 40 BB stage 0 or I individuals. The LC volume and neuronal population remained stable throughout the age groups, suggesting that the changes observed in the LC were AD-related. This is in partial contrast with previous reporting none to up to 50% loss of the LC neurons in older individuals [ 43 , 45 , 56 , 57 ]. Here again, methodological differences including lack of unbiased methods for estimating neuronal counts could explain the discrepancies [ 43 , 45 , 56 – 58 ]. Additionally, lack of power [ 56 – 58 ] or unequal gender distribution [ 43 , 45 ] could also have influenced some of these studies.

This study has a considerable strengths. It relies on a relatively large sample of cases free of non-AD changes that minimize confounders caused by other diseases. Additionally, it brings unparalled number of controls and early AD cases. The age range of our samples is more similar to the individuals at-risk for having prodromal AD than most of the other series. Finally, we took several steps to ensure an unbiased analyses. We employed unbiased stereology in thick, gallocyanin-stained serial sections. This staining penetrates fully into the tissue and provides excellent signal-to-noise ratio (Fiure 1A), resulting in a great tool to visualize cytoarchitectonic features of all neuronal subtypes [ 18 ]. Certain limitations in this study ought to be mentioned. A cross-sectional analysis does not exclude the possibility of an alternative outcome had we chosen another time frame. Also, our estimations may contain bias due to various factors that cannot be controlled, including agonal changes. Regarding the effects of normal aging on LC, we cannot exclude the possibility that LC would change in the “oldest-old”. Unilateral counting increased time efficiency. However, we cannot rule out that bilateral counts of the LC may change our results. Finally, although the method employed for estimating neuronal numbers is not affected by tissue shrinkage, the volume estimations could potentially be. To minimize errors due process-related shrinkage [ 22 ], we employed methods that cause less distortion than traditional neuropathological methods [ 18 ].

In conclusion, our findings suggest that accumulation of tau cytoskeletal pathology and significant volumetric changes precede neuronal loss in the LC during AD progression. Further studies are necessary to investigate which processes protect from and correlate with the onset of LC neuronal death in AD. From an early diagnostic perspective, future in vivo imaging studies should determine whether LC volumetry could replicate the stage-wise atrophy shown here, what are the predictive value of these changes to AD pathology and provide a screening and monitoring biomarkers to AD.
