# Title
Plasma phospholipids identify antecedent memory impairment in older adults

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease causes a progressive dementia that currently affects over 35 million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050 (ref. 1 ). There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies 2 . Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-β levels 3 , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging 4 and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging 5 or inflammaging 6 , are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer’s disease with the required sensitivity and specificity 7 . Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within a 2–3 year timeframe with over 90% accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.

## ONLINE METHODS
The University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board and the University of California, Irvine Institutional Review Board each approved a common research protocol for this investigation. Content of informed consent forms was thoroughly discussed with subjects at the time of entry into the study and verbal and written consent was obtained from all subjects, including that for serial neuropsychological testing and blood draws for biomarker evaluation. A total of 525 volunteers participated in this study as part of the Rochester/Orange County Aging Study, an ongoing natural history study of cognition in community-dwelling older adults ( Supplementary Note ). All participants were community-dwelling older adults from the greater Rochester, NY, and Irvine, CA, communities. Participants were recruited through local media (newspaper and television advertisements), senior organizations and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria included age 70 or older, proficiency with written and spoken English and corrected vision and hearing necessary to complete the cognitive battery. Participants were excluded for the presence of known major psychiatric or neurological illness (including Alzheimer’s disease or MCI, cortical stroke, epilepsy and psychosis) at time of enrollment, current or recent (<1 month) use of anticonvulsants, neuroleptics, HAART, antiemetics and antipsychotics for any reason and serious blood diseases including chronic abnormalities in complete blood count and anemia requiring therapy and/or transfusion. Briefly, we prospectively followed participants with yearly cognitive assessments and collected blood samples following an overnight fast (withholding of all medications) ( Supplementary Note ). At enrollment, each participant completed detailed personal, medical and family history questionnaires. At baseline and at each yearly visit, participants completed measures assessing activities of daily living, memory complaints, and signs and symptoms of depression and were given a detailed cognitive assessment ( Supplementary Table 2 ).

For this study, data from the cognitive tests were used to classify our participants into groups for biomarker discovery. We derived standardized scores ( z -scores) for each participant on each cognitive test and computed composite z -scores for five cognitive domains (attention, executive, language, memory and visuoperceptual) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Normative data for z -score calculations were derived from the performance of our participants on each of the cognitive tests adjusted for age, education, sex and visit. To reduce the effect of cognitively impaired participants on the mean and s.d., age-, education-, sex- and visit-adjusted residuals from each domain z -score model were robustly standardized to have median 0 and robust s.d. of 1, where the robust s.d. = IQR/1.35, as 1.35 is the IQR (interquartile range) of a standard normal distribution.

We categorized the participants into groups of subjects with incident aMCI or early AD (combined into one category, aMCI/AD), cognitively NC subjects and those who converted to aMCI or AD over the course of the study (Converters) based on these composite scores. Impairment was defined as a z -score 1.35 below the cohort median. All participants classified as aMCI met recently revised criteria 29 for the amnestic subtype of MCI 30 . We excluded other behavioral phenotypes of MCI in order to concentrate on the amnestic, which most likely represents nascent AD pathology 31 . All participants with early AD met recently revised criteria for probable AD 32 with impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain. For the aMCI/AD group, scores on the measures of memory complaints (MMQ) and activities of daily living (PGC-IADL) were used to corroborate research definitions of these states. All Converters had nonimpaired memory at entry to the study ( Z mem ≥−1.35), developed memory impairment over the course of the study ( Z mem ≤−1.35) and met criteria for the above definitions of aMCI or AD. To enhance the specificity of our biomarker analyses, NC participants in this study were conservatively defined with Z mem ± 1 s.d. of the cohort median rather than simply ≥−1.35, and all other z -scores ≥−1.35 s.d. ( Supplementary Note ).

At the end of year 3 of the study, 202 participants had completed a baseline and two yearly visits. At the third visit, 53 participants met criteria for aMCI/AD and 96 met criteria for NC. Of the 53 aMCI/AD participants, 18 were Converters and 35 had incident aMCI or AD. The remaining 53 participants did not meet our criteria for either group and were not considered for biomarker profiling. Some of these individuals met criteria for nonamnestic MCI, and many had borderline or even above average memory scores that precluded their inclusion as either aMCI/AD or NC ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We matched 53 NC participants to the 53 aMCI/AD participants based on sex, age and education level. We used blood samples obtained on the last available study visit for the 53 MCI/AD and 53 NC for biomarker discovery. We included two blood samples from each of the 18 Converters, one from the baseline visit (Converter pre ) when Z mem was nonimpaired and one from the third visit (Converter post ) when Z mem was impaired and they met criteria for either aMCI or AD. Thus, a total of 124 samples from 106 participants were submitted for biomarker discovery.

We employed internal cross-validation to validate findings from the discovery phase. Blood samples for validation were identified at the end of the fifth year of the study, and all 106 participants included in the discovery phase were excluded from consideration for the validation phase ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Cognitive composite z -scores were recalculated based on the entire sample available, and the same procedure and criteria were used to identify samples for the validation phase. A total of 145 participants met criteria for a group: 21aMCI/AD and 124 NC. Of the 21 aMCI/AD, 10 were Converters. We matched 20 NC participants to the aMCI/AD participants on the basis of age, sex and education level as in the discovery phase. In total, 40 participants contributed plasma samples to the validation phase, as 1 aMCI/AD subject’s plasma sample was not able to be used. As before, the 10 Converters also contributed a baseline sample (Converter pre ) for a total of 50 samples.

The neurocognitive analyses were designed to demonstrate the general equivalence of the discovery and validation samples on clinical and cognitive measures. We used separate multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) to examine discovery and validation group performance on the composite z -scores and on self-reported measures of memory complaints, memory related functional impairment and depressive symptoms, as well as a global measure of cognitive function. In the first MANOVA, biomarker sample (discovery, validation) was the independent variable and MMQ, IADL, geriatric depression scale and mini-mental state examination were the dependent variables. In the second MANOVA, biomarker sample (discovery, validation) was the independent variable, and the five cognitive domain z -scores ( Z att , Z exe , Z lan , Z mem and Z vis ) were the dependent variables. Significance for the two-sided tests was set at α = 0.05, and we used Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD procedure for post hoc comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 21).

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-grade acetonitrile, isopropanol, water and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (New Jersey, USA). High purity formic acid (99%) was purchased from Thermo-Scientific (Rockford, IL). Debrisoquine, 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA), Pro-Asn, glycoursodeoxycholic acid andmalic acid were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All lipid standards including 14:0 LPA, 17:0 Ceramide, 12:0 LPC, 18:0 Lyso PI and PC(22:6/0:0) were procured from Avanti Polar Lipids (USA).

Briefly, the plasma samples were thawed on ice and vortexed. For metabolite extraction, 25 µL of plasma sample was mixed with 175 µL of extraction buffer (25% acetonitrile in 40% methanol and 35% water) containing internal standards (10 µL of debrisoquine (1 mg/mL), 50 µL of 4, nitrobenzoic acid (1 mg/mL), 27.3 µl of ceramide (1 mg/mL) and 2.5 µL of LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) (4 mg/mL) in 10 mL). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were reconstituted in 200 µL of buffer containing 5% methanol, 1% acetonitrile and 94% water. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 °C to remove fine particulates. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial for Ultraperformance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis.

Each sample (2 µL) was injected onto a reverse-phase CSH C18 1.7 µM 2.1×100 mm column using an Acquity H-class UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA). The gradient mobile phase comprised of water containing 0.1% formic acid solution (Solvent A), 100% acetonitrile (Solvent B) and 10% acetonitrile in isopropanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate (Solvent C). Each sample was resolved for 13 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 8 min and then 0.4 mL/min from 8 to 13 min. The UPLC gradient consisted of 98% A and 2% B for 0.5 min and then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B and 40% A from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, followed by a ramp of curve 6 to 98% B and 2% A from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a ramp to 5% B and 95% C from 9.0 min to 10.0 min at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and finally a ramp to 98% A and 2% B from 11.0 min to 13 min. The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization. Mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument (Xevo G2 QTOF, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in either negative (ESI − ) or positive (ESI + ) electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 3,200 V in positive mode and 2,800 V in negative mode and a sampling cone voltage of 30 V in both modes. The desolvation gas flow was set to 750 l h −1 , and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The source temperature was set at 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of a lock-spray interface of leucine-enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H] + or 554.2615 [M−H] − ) at a concentration of 2 pg/µL in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and a rate of 2 µL/min. Data were acquired in centroid MS mode from 50 to 1,200 m/z mass range for TOF-MS scanning as single injection per sample, and the batch acquisition was repeated to check experimental reproducibility. For the metabolomics profiling experiments, pooled quality control (QC) samples (generated by taking an equal aliquot of all the samples included in the experiment) were run at the beginning of the sample queue for column conditioning and every ten injections thereafter to assess inconsistencies that are particularly evident in large batch acquisitions in terms of retention time drifts and variation in ion intensity over time. This approach has been recommended and used as a standard practice by leading metabolomics researchers 33 . A test mix of standard metabolites was run at the beginning and at the end of the run to evaluate instrument performance with respect to sensitivity and mass accuracy. The overlay of the total ion chromatograms of the quality control samples depicted excellent retention time reproducibility. The sample queue was randomized to remove bias.

LC-MSmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is increasingly used in clinical settings for quantitative assay of small molecules and peptides such as vitamin D, serum bile acid and parathyroid hormone under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments environments with high sensitivities and specificities 34 . In this study, targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 (BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria). This validated targeted assay allows for simultaneous detection and quantification of metabolites in plasma samples (10 µL) in a high-throughput manner. The methods have been described in detail 35 , 36 . The plasma samples were processed as per the instructions by the manufacturer and analyzed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in the MRM mode. The measurements were made in a 96-well format for a total of 148 samples, and seven calibration standards and three quality control samples were integrated in the kit. Briefly, the flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method was used to quantify a panel of 144 lipids simultaneously by multiple reaction monitoring. The other metabolites are resolved on the UPLC and quantified using scheduled MRMs. The kit facilitates absolute quantitation of 21 amino acids, hexose, carnitine, 39 acylcarnitines, 15 sphingomyelins, 90 phosphatidylcholines and 19 biogenic amines. Data analysis was performed using the MetIQ software (Biocrates), and the statistical analyses included the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with follow-up Mann-Whitney U -tests for pairwise comparisons using the STAT pack module v3 (Biocrates). Significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method ( P < 0.025). The abundance is calculated from area under the curve by normalizing to the respective isotope labeled internal standard. The concentration is expressed as nmol/L. Human EDTA plasma samples spiked with standard metabolites were used as quality control samples to assess reproducibility of the assay. The mean of the coefficient of variation (CV) for the 180 metabolites was 0.08, and 95% of the metabolites had a CV of <0.15.

The signal intensity of the metabolites within similar groups was normally distributed with a standard deviation of 1.5. If the true difference in the Converterpre and NC groups’ mean is twofold, we will have over 90% power to detect differential metabolites at an overall significance level of 5% with Bonferroni’s adjustment using 30 subjects per group.

The m/z features of metabolites were normalized with log transformation that stabilized the variance, followed by a quantile normalization to make the empirical distribution of intensities the same across samples 37 . The metabolites were selected among all those known to be identifiable using a ROC regularized learning technique 38 , 39 based on the LASSO penalty 8 , 9 as implemented with the R package ‘glmnet’ 40 , which uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion. We first obtained the regularization path over a grid of values for the tuning parameter λ through tenfold cross-validation. The optimal value of the tuning parameter lambda, which was obtained by the cross-validation procedure, was then used to fit the model. All the features with nonzero coefficients were retained for subsequent analysis. This technique is known to reduce overfitting and achieve similar prediction accuracy as the sparse supporting vector machine. The classification performance of the selected metabolites was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC can be understood as a plot of the probability of classifying correctly the positive samples against the rate of incorrectly classifying true negative samples. So the AUC measure of an ROC plot is a measure of predictive accuracy. To maintain rigor of independent validation, the simple logistic model with the ten-metabolite panel was used, although a more refined model can yield greater AUC. The validation phase was performed in a blinded fashion such that the sample group was not known by the statistical team.
