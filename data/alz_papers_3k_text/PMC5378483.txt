[18F]FDG PET signal is driven by astroglial glutamate transport

# Abstract
Contributions of glial cells to neuroenergetics have been the focus of extensive debate. Here we provide the first positron emission tomography (PET) evidence that activation of the astrocytic glutamate transport via GLT-1 triggers widespread but graded glucose uptake in the rodent brain. Our results highlight the need for a reevaluation of the interpretation of [ 18 F]FDG PET data, whereby astrocytes would be recognized to contribute significantly to the [ 18 F]FDG signal.

## Online Methods
Animals were kept in a room with controlled temperature (21°C) under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 7 am) and had access to food and water ad libitum . All procedures were carried out according to the guide to the care and use of experimental animals (Ed2) of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Animal experiments were performed according to the institutional guidelines of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology and the Brazilian guidelines of animal experimentation number 11794/08, which are compliant with McGill University guidelines for experimental research (Montreal, QC, Canada).

Ten male two-month old Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight: 245–302 g) were scanned for baseline and one day after challenge. The scanning was made between 10:30 am – 1:30 pm. Animals received an intravenous bolus injection (0.2 mL) of [ 18 F]FDG (mean ± s.d.: 8.14 ± 0.555 MBq) into the tail vein. Rats were maintained awake for a 40 minutes uptake period, followed by a 10 minutes static acquisition under isoflurane anesthesia. A CT transmission scan was acquired to correct for attenuation. PET measurements were performed on an Inveon microPET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Solution, Knoxville, TN). Rats lay in prone position with the head immobilized by both a body holder and the nose cone of the anesthesia system (2% isoflurane at 0.5 L/min oxygen flow). The brain was positioned in the center of the field of view. The body temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 1°C, and vital signs, including respiration, heart rate, and body temperature, were monitored throughout scanning procedures (BioVet; m2m Imaging Corp, Newark, NJ, USA). Images were reconstructed by fully-3D ordered subset expectation maximization (3D-OSEM) algorithm, normalized and corrected for scatter, dead time and decay.

Rats were scanned twice under different pretreatment conditions. Firstly, animals were anesthetized (2% isoflurane at 0.5 L/min oxygen flow) and positioned in the scanner. For the baseline scan, they received a tail vein injection of saline 30 minutes before the [ 18 F]FDG injection. For the challenge scan, they received a tail vein injection of CEF 200 mg/kg (Rocephin®, Basel, Switzerland) Roche, 30 minutes before the [ 18 F]FDG injection ( Fig. 1a ).

Imaging analysis was conducted using minc-tools ( http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/HomePage ). MicroPET images were manually co-registered to a standard rat histological template. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated using the following equation: SUV = (radioactivity)/(dose injected/body weight). Regional SUV was calculated based on manually delimited volumes of interest (VOIs), defined on the rat template for the following brain regions: frontal cortex (162.66 mm 3 ), parietal cortex (380.36 mm 3 ), hippocampus (63.25 mm 3 ), striatum (88.72 mm 3 ), thalamus (62.43 mm 3 ), and cerebellum (155.64 mm 3 ). For metabolic network analyses, [ 18 F]FDG data were normalized by dose injected and body mass, to account for differences in total tracer tissue concentration. Matrices were constructed using cross-correlation coefficient symmetric analyses (VOIs above-stated, left and right hemispheres, 12×12 matrices). For further details about microPET imaging analyses see ref. 21 . Data normalization by a reference region was not recommended in our analyses due to the lack of a reference region, since GLT-1 is widely present in the whole brain 22 .

Two-month old Sprague-Dawley male rats (body weight: 280–320g, 4–5 per group) were anesthetized with urethane (1g/kg, ip) on a heating blanket to keep body temperature at 37°C. The right femoral vein was cannulated for drug injection, while a heparin-catheter was placed in the artery for blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, and blood gas measurements (pH, pO 2 and pCO 2 ). Rats were then placed in a stereotaxic frame and bones over the left prefrontal (AP: + 4.7 mm; lateral: + 1 mm from Bregma) and barrel (AP 2.5 to 3 mm, ML 6 to 7 mm from Bregma) cortices were thinned to translucency for positioning of two Laser-Doppler probes (Transonic Systems). Resting CBF was continuously recorded for 10 minutes prior to CEF injection (baseline) and for 40 minutes following CEF injection. The CBF values from laser Doppler flowmetry were averaged every second and expressed as percent change from the mean of 10 minutes.

Right whiskers were stimulated for 20 seconds (repeated every minute) using an electrical brush (for 20 seconds, ~10 Hz) at baseline, and 40 minutes after drug injection. The evoked CBF response, 1 second averages were computed for 1 minute 20 seconds (30 seconds before, 20 seconds stimulation, 30 seconds after stimulation).

Thirty, two-month old Sprague Dawley rats were submitted to the open field test under two different pretreatment conditions. Animals were briefly anesthetized (2% isoflurane at 0.5 L/min oxygen flow) and received a received a single tail vein injection of saline or CEF 200 mg/kg 70 minutes before the open field test. The apparatus for this test was a grey acrylic box (50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm). Experiments were conducted in a sound-attenuated room under low-intensity light (12 lx) during the light cycle. Rats were placed in the center of the box and spontaneous locomotion parameters were recorded with a video camera for 10 min. All analyses were performed using Any-maze, a computer-operated tracking system (Any-maze, Stoelting, Woods Dale, IL).

Three-month old male Wistar rats were euthanized by decapitation, had their cerebral cortices aseptically dissected and meninges removed. The tissue was digested using trypsin at 37 °C and papain, as previously described 23 . After mechanical dissociation and centrifugation, the cells were plated in 6- or 24-well plates with DMEM/F12 medium (Life technologies [11330-032], Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life technologies [12657-029], Carlsbad, CA) changed regularly; during the 1 st week, the medium was replaced once every 2 days and from the 2 nd week on, once every four days. From the 2 nd week on, astrocytes received medium supplemented with 20% FBS until they reached confluence (at approximately the 3 rd week). No dibutyryl cAMP was added to the culture medium in order to observe the naive response of the cells. Expression of specific neuronal (anti-NeuN, EDM Millipore [MAB377], Billerica, MA) and microglial (Anti-Cd11b/c, Invitrogen [MR6200], Carlsbad, CA) proteins was evaluated in order to determine the purity of the astrocyte cultures, which was found to be around 95 %. Experiments involving adult culture of astrocytes were replicated at least 3 times.

Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described 23 . Briefly, cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After blocking overnight with 4% albumin, the cells were incubated overnight with anti-GFAP (1:400; Dako [Z0334], Carpienteria, CA), anti-GLT-1 (1:1000; Alpha diagnostic [GLT11-A], San Antonio, TX), anti-vimentin (1:1000; Sigma Aldrich [V6630], St. Louis, MO) or anti-NeuN (1:50; EDM Millipore [MAB377], Billerica, MA) at 4°C, followed by PBS washes and incubation with a specific secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 (green staining, [111-545-003]) or 594 (red staining, [315-585-003]) for 1 h at room temperature. For all the immunostaining-negative controls, reactions were performed omitting the primary antibody. No reactivity was observed when the primary antibody was excluded. Cell nuclei were stained with 0.2 mg/mL of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; EDM Millipore [268298], Billerica, MA). The cells were visualized with a Nikon inverted microscope and the images were transferred to a computer with a digital camera (Sound Vision Inc.).

Cells were solubilized in lysis solution containing 4 % SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris– HCl (pH 6.8). Protein content was measured, the samples were standardized in sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 4 % (v/v) glycerol, 0.002 % (w/v) bromophenol blue) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS/PAGE (10 mg protein per sample), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, as previously described 23 . Adequate loading of each sample was confirmed using Ponceau S staining. Membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) with anti-GLT-1 (1:1000, Alpha diagnostic [GLT11-A], San Antonio, TX) and anti-GAPDH (1:1000, EMD Millipore [G9545], Billerica, MA). The membranes were then washed and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (GE healthcare [NA934V], Little Chalfont, UK) immunoglobulin at a dilution of 1:4000 for 2 h. Chemiluminescence signals were detected with an Image Quant LAS4000 system (GE Healthcare) using ECL kit. Full-length gels and membranes with molecular weight standards were shown on Supplementary Figure 6 .

After the cells reached confluence, D-Aspartate uptake was performed as previously described 24 with some modifications. Briefly, cells were rinsed once with HBSS and then the medium (C5793, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) was replaced with fresh DMEM/F12 1% FBS in presence or absence of 0.1 μM CEF for 70 min at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced by DMEM/F12 1% FBS containing 1mCi/mL D-[2,3- 3 H] Aspartate (Perkin Elmer [NET581001MC], Boston, MA) in presence or absence of 0.1 μM CEF. The incubation was stopped after 5 min by removal of the medium and rinsing the cells three times with HBSS. The cells were then lysed in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Unspecific uptake was carried out at 4 °C and subtracted from total uptake.

Basal and CEF-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake were assessed as previously described with some modifications 9 . Briefly, cells in 6- or 24- well plates were rinsed once with HBSS and then the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/F12 1% FBS in presence or absence of CEF 0.1 uM for 70 min at 37 °C. Adult astrocytes were then incubated with DMEM/F12 1%FBS containing 1 mCi/ml [ 3 H]2DG (GE healthcare [TRK672], Little Chalfont, UK) for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with HBSS and lysed overnight with NaOH 0.5 M. The incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Cytochalasin B 10 mM (Sigma Aldrich [C2743], Saint Louis, MO) was used as a specific glucose transporter inhibitor. Deoxyglucose uptake was determined by subtracting the uptake in the presence of cytochalasin B from the total uptake. For GLT-1 pharmacological blockade, DHK (ABCAM [ab120066], Cambrigde, UK) 100 μM was added to the medium 6 minutes before [ 3 H]2DG uptake.

Free amino acids concentration in the culture medium was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described 25 . Medium cell-free supernatant aliquots were used to quantify glutamate. The analysis was performed using a reverse phase column (Supelcosil LC-18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm, Supelco) in a Shimadzu Instruments liquid chromatograph (50 μL loop valve injection, 40 uL injection volume) and fluorescent detection after pre-column derivatization with 100,5 μL OPA (5.4 mg OPA in 1 mL 0.2 M sodium borate pH 9.5) plus 25,5 μL 4% mercaptoethanol. The mobile phase flowed at a rate of 1.4 mL/min and column temperature was 24 °C. Buffer composition is A: 0.04 mol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 80% of methanol; B: 0.01 mol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 20% of methanol. The gradient profile was modified according to the content of buffer B in the mobile phase: 100% at 0.10 min, 90% at 15 min, 48% at 10 min,100% at 60 min. Absorbance was read at 360 nm and 455 nm, excitation and emission respectively, in a Shimadzu fluorescence detector. Samples of 20 μL were used and concentration was expressed in μM (as mean ± s.e.m). Glutamate was identified by its retention time and was quantitatively determined by using chromatographic peak area. A standard amino acid mixture was used for HPLC quality control and calibration.

Data distribution was first tested for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Sample size was evaluated using G*power 3.1 for Mac (effect size dz = 1.77, noncentrality parameter δ = 4.68, Critical t = 2.44 and actual power = 0.97) based on a previous publication 26 . Regional brain binding differences between baseline and challenge were estimated across the six VOIs using two-tailed paired Student t-test. Comparisons between baseline and challenge were conducted at the voxel level using t-statistic analysis (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Rminc, https://github.com/mcvaneede/RMINC ). All analyses were conducted using minctools, which is available online at https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-tools . T-statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using random field theory 27 . Resting CBF was analyzed by repeated measure two-way ANOVA, and evoked CBF with repeated measure one-way ANOVA. Data acquisitions were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. However, data analyses (imaging, biochemistry and behavior) were conducted in blind conditions. Animals were randomly assigned for all experiments, however no formal randomization protocol was utilized in this study. Open field task and In Vitro studies were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student-t test. [ 3 H]2DG uptake data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. SPSS 18.0 and MATLAB were used for all analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.
