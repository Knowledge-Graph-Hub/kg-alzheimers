A complement-microglial axis drives synapse loss during virus-induced memory impairment

# Abstract
Over 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasive infection with West Nile virus (WNV) exhibit chronic cognitive sequelae 1 , 2 . Although thousands of cases of WNV-mediated memory dysfunction accrue annually 3 , the mechanisms responsible for these impairments are unknown. The classical complement cascade, a key component of innate immune pathogen defence, mediates synaptic pruning by microglia during early postnatal development 4 , 5 . Here we show that viral infection of adult hippocampal neurons induces complement-mediated elimination of presynaptic terminals in a murine WNV neuroinvasive disease model. Inoculation of WNV-NS5-E218A, a WNV with a mutant NS5(E218A) protein 6 , 7 leads to survival rates and cognitive dysfunction that mirror human WNV neuroinvasive disease. WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice (recovery defined as survival after acute infection) display impaired spatial learning and persistence of phagocytic microglia without loss of hippocampal neurons or volume. Hippocampi from WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice with poor spatial learning show increased expression of genes that drive synaptic remodelling by microglia via complement. C1QA was upregulated and localized to microglia, infected neurons and presynaptic terminals during WNV neuroinvasive disease. Murine and human WNV neuroinvasive disease post-mortem samples exhibit loss of hippocampal CA3 presynaptic terminals, and murine studies revealed microglial engulfment of presynaptic terminals during acute infection and after recovery. Mice with fewer microglia ( Il34 −/ − mice with a deficiency in IL-34 production) or deficiency in complement C3 or C3a receptor were protected from WNV-induced synaptic terminal loss. Our study provides a new murine model of WNV-induced spatial memory impairment, and identifies a potential mechanism underlying neurocognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV neuroinvasive disease.

## METHODS
At the outset of all experiments, 8–10-week-old male and female mice were used. C57BL/6J and CD11b −/− ( CR3 −/− ) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. C3 −/− , CR1 / 2 −/− (in mice, CR1 and CR2 are splice variants both derived from the mouse Cr2 gene), and C3aR −/− mice (> 10 generations back-crossed to C57BL/6) were obtained from John Atkinson (Washington University), CX 3 CR1–GFP +/− mice (> 10 generations backcrossed to C57Bl/6) were obtained from Richard Ransohoff (Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation), μMT −/− mice (C57BL/6 background) were obtained from Michael Diamond (Washington University), and Il34 −/− mice (C57BL/6 background) were obtained from Marco Colonna (Washington University). All mice were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups at the beginning of each experiment. All experimental protocols were performed in compliance with the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee (protocol number 20140122).

The WNV strain 3000.0259 was isolated in New York and passaged once in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells to generate an insect-cell-derived stock. Then 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) of WNV-NY99 were delivered in 50 μl to the footpad of anaesthetized mice. WNV-NS5-E218A, which harbours a single point mutation in the 2′ O -methyl-transferase gene, was obtained from Michael Diamond (Washington University) and passaged in Vero cells as described previously 6 . Deeply anaesthetized mice were administered with 10 4 pfu of WNV-NS5-E218A or 10 pfu of WNV-NY99 in 10 μl into the brain’s third ventricle via a guided 29 gauge needle.

Stock titres of all viruses were determined by using BHK21 cells for viral plaque assay as previously described 14 .

Cells were isolated from brains of wild-type mice at day 7 post-infection and stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD8, CD11b, and CD45 as previously described 14 . Data collection and analysis were performed with an LSRII flow cytometer using FlowJo software.

The open-field test was used to assess baseline differences in anxiety or locomotor behaviour, before Barnes maze experiments. A standard Open Field arena (54 × 54 cm, custom built) was used, consisting of a simple square box with a grid (6 squares per side) along the base. Animals were placed in the centre of the arena and allowed to explore for 5 min. The arena was decontaminated with 70% ethanol between each trial. Locomotor activity was assessed by counting the number of lines the animal crossed during the testing period, and anxiety was assessed by counting the number of times the animal crossed through the centre of the field. Behaviour was recorded using a camera (Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS), and a blinded experimenter scored the trial. Any mice that jumped out of the open-field maze were excluded from analyses.

The Barnes maze was used to assess visual spatial memory. An elevated Barnes maze (91.4 cm diameter, custom built) containing 19 empty holes and 1 target hole with a hidden escape chamber was used for testing (5 cm diameter holes were evenly spaced around the table, 6.35 cm from the edge). Visual cues were placed around the room and remained in the same location during the entire testing period. Mice were tested on the Barnes maze over the course of 5 consecutive days. Each mouse received two trials per day, spaced exactly 30 min apart. For each trial, the mouse was placed in the centre of the maze in a covered start box for 10 s, and removal of the box signalled the start of a trial. Each mouse was given 3 min to explore the maze and find the target hole. Mice that did not enter the target hole within 3 min were gently guided into the hole. After each trial, the mouse remained in the target hole for exactly 1 min, and then was returned to its home cage. The maze was decontaminated with 70% ethanol between each trial. The numbers of errors (nose pokes over non-target holes) and the latency to find the target hole (amount of time elapsed before nose poke over target hole) were measured. Behaviour was recorded using a camera (Canon Powershot SD1100IS), and a blinded experimenter scored the trials. Any mice which fell off the Barnes maze table during any trial were excluded from analyses. No randomization was required for these studies.

Following perfusion with ice-cold PBS and 4% PFA, brains were immersion-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, followed by cryoprotection in two exchanges of 30% sucrose for 72 h, then frozen in OCT (Fisher). 9μm-thick fixed-frozen coronal brain sections were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and nonspecific antibody was blocked with 5–10% normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse on mouse kit (MOM basic kit, Vector) was used as per the manufacturer’s protocol when detecting synaptophysin to reduce endogenous mouse antibody staining. After block, slides were exposed to primary antibody or isotype matched IgG overnight at 4 °C, washed with 1 × PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) and coverslips were applied with vectashield (Vector). Immunofluorescence was analysed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope and accompanying software (Zeiss). Positive immunofluorescent signals were quantified by a blinded experimenter using the NIH Image analysis software, ImageJ.

TUNEL staining was performed using the TMR-red in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) as per manufacturer’s instructions. C1QA staining was performed as previously described 29 .

C1QA (undiluted, described previously 29 ), WNV (1:100, described previously 14 ), rat anti-GFAP (1:200, Invitrogen catalogue number 13-0300), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:100, WAKO catalogue number 019-19741), mouse anti-NeuN-biotin (1:100, Millipore catalogue number MAB 377B), chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000, Abcam catalogue number 13970), rabbit anti-Synapsin1 (1:200, Millipore catalogue number Ab1543), mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:50, DAKO catalogue number M0776 or 1:50 Abcam catalogue number ab8049), guinea-pig anti-VGlut1 (1:300, Synaptic Systems catalogue number 135304), rabbit anti-Homer1 (1:200, Synaptic Systems 160003), rabbit anti-C3d (1:500, DAKO catalogue number A0063), rabbit anti S100β (1:300, Abcam catalogue number ab52642), rat anti-Lamp1 (1:50, BD Pharmingen catalogue number 553792), and rat anti-CD68 (1:200, Serotec catalogue number MCA1957).

Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa-555, or Alexa-633 (Invitrogen) were used at 1:400 dilution.

Mice were intracardially perfused, first with ice-cold PBS and then with a mixture of 4% PFA and 10% Multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine, Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ). Heads were further fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h before being trimmed of extraneous tissue around the skull (to minimize the field of view). Heads were then placed in 1% Multihance in PBS until being imaged several days later. Ex vivo , whole-head MR imaging experiments were performed at 4.7 T using an Agilent/Varian (Santa Clara, CA) DirectDrive1 small-animal scanner. Data were collected with a custom-made RF foil coil that fits tightly around the head using a 3D, T1-weighted gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: TR = 105 ms, TE = 6 ms, flip angle = 90°, isotropic resolution = (0.0625 mm) 3 , and scan time ~ 11 h. Regions of interest were manually drawn for the whole brain and hippocampus in ITK-SNAP ( http://www.itksnap.org ) from which volumes were calculated.

Mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS then hippocampi were dissected and snap-frozen in Tri-reagent (Ambion). Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized, and RNA purified as previously described 30 using the RNA Ribopure kit (Ambion). RNA was precipitated with 25 mM ammonium acetate in 100% ethanol at −80 °C overnight, resuspended in RNase-free H 2 O, and checked for purity. RNA was then treated with RNase-out and DNase I (invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Hippocampal RNA was isolated as described above and submitted to the Washington University Genome Technology Access Center. The total RNA quality and quantity were then determined by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE), according to manufacturer’s recommendations, respectively. A total of 400 ng of RNA transcripts from each sample were amplified by T7 linear amplification with the MessageAmp TotalPrep Amplification kit (Life Technologies-Ambion, Austin, TX). Then 1.5 μg of each amplified and biotinylated RNA (aRNA) sample was hybridized onto Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 expression beadchips, followed by cy3 steptavidin-based staining, washing, and scanning, according to Illumina standard protocol. The iScan scanner-created image data were loaded into Illumina GenomeStudio (v2011) for generation of expression values and data normalizations. Only those probes that were detected at P < 0.05 in at least one of the samples were used in downstream statistical analysis. Background subtracted and quantile normalized data were used in statistical analysis for identification of differentially expressed genes with one-way ANOVA test using Partek Genomics Suite (v6.6, St. Louis, MO). All original P values in the ANOVA analysis were adjusted by q -value based multiple test correction 31 . KEGG pathway analysis was performed using DAVID bioinformatics database functional annotation tool v.6.7 (ref. 32 ). Microarray data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE72139)

cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers, oligodT15, and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). A single reverse transcription master mix was used to reverse transcribe all samples to minimize differences in reverse transcription efficiency. The following conditions were used for reverse transcription reactions: 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min.

For all primer sets except for the strand-specific WNV PCR reaction (detailed below), PCR reactions were prepared using Power SYBR Green PCR mastermix and calculated copies were normalized against copies of the housekeeping gene, Gapdh.

Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 6 .

Two-step strand specific RT-PCR was performed using GVA and T7 tagged primers during cDNA synthesis as a modification to a procedure previously described 33 . First, cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer’s instruction, with the addition of 1 pmol of the positive-strand primer GVA_TxsspE1229 and 1 pmol of the negative strand primer T7_TxsspE1160 to the 10 μl reaction mixture. Strand specific cDNA was then amplified in a qPCR reaction using primers directed against the strand specific WNV sequence and the tag sequence. Each 12.5 μl qPCR reaction mixture contained 6.25 μl TaqMan Gene Expression Master mix, 10 pmol tag primer (positive mix: GVA, negative mix: T7), 10 pmol strand specific primer (positive mix: TXsspE1160, negative mix: TXsspE1229), 2.5 pmol strand specific probe (WNVsspEProbe) and 50 ng strand specific cDNA. Thermal cycling was performed using Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system with a 384-well block. Copies were calculated based on a standard curve generated from purified PCR product from positive strand or negative strand reactions, and normalized to amount of Gapdh in each sample.

ImageJ was used to threshold single-plane confocal images, draw a region of interest encompassing the CA3 mossy fibres, and to quantify the number of synaptophysin or VGlut1 + puncta containing between 0.5 and 25 square μm 2 in area. For each mouse, at least 12 images at 63 × magnification were counted, which were derived from at least 4 fixed-frozen coronal sections spaced 50 μM apart.

ImageJ was used to threshold single-plane confocal images, draw a region of interest encompassing each IBA1 + cell within the hippocampal CA3, and to quantify the number of synaptophysin + , Lamp1 + , IBA1 + puncta between 0.2 and 25 μm 2 in area within each IBA1 + cell. For each mouse, at least 8 images at 63 × magnification were counted, which were derived from at least 4 fixed-frozen coronal sections spaced 50 μM apart.

Mice were perfused with 4% PFA, the brain was removed, and immersion fixed for 24 h at room temperature. Tissue was washed in PBS, and 100 μm sections were cut from regions of interest using a vibratome. Sections were incubated in 0.5% gelatin, 5% horse serum, and 0.01% saponin in PBS for 5 h on a rotator at room temperature. Sections were then incubated for 48 h at 4 °C on a rotator with rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:600; Wako). After washing in dPBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C on rotator with donkey anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody, (1:500; Rockland) in 0.5% gelatin and 5% horse serum in dPBS. Sections were again washed, and then incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:1000; Rockland, S000-03) for 3 h at room temperature, followed by another wash. HRP was visualized using the DAB Substrate Kit (Cell Marque,957D) for 5 min, washed and then fixed with 2% PFA, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, in PBS for 30 min, followed by a wash in PBS. Sections were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and then dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol for 30 min each. Sections were then infiltrated with 1:1 Spurr’s resin and 100% ethanol overnight on a rotator, followed by two changes in pure Spurr’s resin over 24 h. Sections were embedded with Aclar film (EMS, 50425), and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. The hippocampus was trimmed from the polymerized section, glued to a previously prepared block of Spurr’s resin, and allowed to cure for at least 24 h. Using a Diatome ultra 45° diamond knife and a LEICA Ultracut UC7, blocks were sectioned at 500 nm to confirm location of the tissue and the positivity of antibodies. Once confirmed, 90 nm sections were cut and picked up onto 200 hex mesh, formvar-carbon coated copper grids (Ted Pella, 01800-F). Images were digitally captured using a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope with AMT digital camera.

Confocal z -stack images taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope at 63 × magnification, consisting of at least 10 images were transformed into 3D reconstruction videos using Volocity 3D image analysis software (PerkinElmer).

Sections were imaged using a Zeiss ELYRA PS1 microscope. 0.101 μm optical slices of the CA3 region of the hippocampus were captured and images subsequently processed using Zeiss SIM algorithms to generate structured illumination images. Zeiss Zen software was used to generate orthogonal viewpoints showing colocalization of VGlut1 and C1q in the x , y and z planes.

Human autopsy hippocampal tissue embedded in paraffin was obtained from St. Louis University Medical Center (St. Louis, MO) and Presbyterian / St. Luke’s Medical Center (Denver, CO). Sections were first deparaffinized and then boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for 30 min, for antigen retrieval before staining with anti-synaptophysin antibody (DAKO, 1:50).

Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed on 9 μm coronal brain sections that were 4% PFA-fixed and frozen. C1QA and NSE were used as double mRNA staining and IBA1 as immune-staining. C1qA and NSE anti-sense RNA was made and labelled with cyanine and fluorescein, respectively, using an RNA labelling kit (Roche). C1QA was amplified by PCR from pCMV SPORT6 C1qA plasmid (Openbiosystem MMM1013-63584), using forward 5′-GGCATCCGGACTGGTATCCGAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTAAATGCGACCCTTTGCGGGG-3′ primers, which was digested with SalI and transcribed with T7 promoter. The RNA probes were incubated overnight at 64 °C, and then detected with antibodies against fluorescein and cyanine (Roche). The staining reaction was then amplified with a TSA staining kit (PerkinElmer). A rabbit anti-IBA1 (Wako) antibody was used to label macrophages and microglia and detected with a donkey anti-rabbit 647 antibody (Life technologies). Stained sections were then imaged and analysed on a Zeiss AX10 fluorescent microscope. Statistical analysis. To determine mouse group sizes for virological or immunological studies, power analysis was performed using the following values: probability of type I error = 0.05, power = 80%, fivefold hypothetical difference in mean, and population variance of 25-fold (virological studies) or 12-fold (immunological studies). Results from Barnes maze spatial learning and memory studies were compared by repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Microarray data was analysed by one-way ANOVA and fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate q < 0.05 to correct for multiple hypotheses for mock vs WNV-all comparison, P < 0.05 for WNV good learners vs WNV poor learners. Variance between groups was equivalent except for cases noted within figure legends and the comparison for number of presynaptic terminals in Fig. 3 a and the comparisons at 7 and 25 dpi in Fig. 3f , in which a Welch’s correction on the two-tailed t-test was used to correct for unequal variance. All other experiments were compared by Student’s two-tailed t-test, with *P < 0.05 considered significant. Power calculations using results observed in a pilot study in which WNV-recovered mice exhibit a two-fold increase in peak errors compared with mock-infected animals indicate that at least 15 recovered mice per group will be required to obtain statistical significance ( P < 0.05) on Barnes maze testing.
