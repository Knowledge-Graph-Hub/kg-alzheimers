Silent Hippocampal Seizures and Spikes Identified by Foramen Ovale Electrodes in Alzheimer’s Disease

# Abstract
We directly assessed mesial temporal activity in two Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients without a history or EEG evidence of seizures, using intracranial foramen ovale electrodes. We detected clinically silent hippocampal seizures and epileptiform spikes during sleep, a period when both were most likely to interfere with memory consolidation. These index cases support a model in which early development of occult hippocampal hyperexcitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

## Online Methods
After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, consent for FO electrode placement was obtained from either the patient (Patient #1 had capacity to provide consent) or from the patient’s health care proxy (Patient #2). Placement of foramen ovale (FO) electrodes 14 was performed in the operating room under sterile conditions, with the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia and positioned supine with neck extended and head turned away from the site of insertion. Prior to insertion, each cheek was prepped with chlorhexidine, and Lidocaine 1% was injected 2.5 cm lateral to the labial fissure. With the fluoroscope C-arm angled 45 degrees from vertical, the foramen ovale was visualized. A 16-gauge needle was initially used to pass through the skin, and a 10-gauge needle with stylet (Ad-Tech, Racine, WI) was advanced towards the foramen ovale under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle tip was placed approximately 2mm anterior to the clival line, and a lateral fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm the needle’s position. The stylet was then removed, and a four-contact FO electrode (Ad-Tech, Racine, WI) was advanced through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance so that all electrode contacts were positioned beyond the tip of the needle. A lateral fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm electrode position, and the needle was gently withdrawn. The electrode was sutured to the cheek with 0 silk sutures. The same procedure was repeated to place the FO electrode on the contralateral side. After placement of both FO electrodes, anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic images were taken to confirm final electrode position, and sterile dressings were placed over the electrode exit site on each cheek. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and observed in the post-anesthesia recovery room for 1 hour. A post-procedure CT head was obtained, and the patient was brought to the inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for further monitoring. While FO electrodes were in place, the patient remained on vancomycin and ceftriaxone antimicrobial prophylaxis. At the end of the investigation, prophylactic anticoagulation was held for 24 hours, and the FO electrodes were removed at the bedside.

Scalp electrodes were placed using the International 10–20 system with anterior temporal electrodes (T1, T2). All recordings were acquired using XLTEK hardware (Natus Medical Inc., Pleasanton CA) with data sampled at 1024 Hz. Scalp EEG and FO electrode recordings were visually interpreted as per routine clinical practice. Spike quantification was performed manually on randomly sampled, 30–60 minute segments of uninterrupted awake or asleep states.

The Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration test 26 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment 27 were administered by physicians and/or other trained personnel during Memory Disorders Unit and/or Epilepsy Clinic visits. CDR scales were assessed at each Memory Disorders Unit visit.

CSF amyloid and tau analysis was performed by Athena Diagnostics, Marlborough, MA (ADmark Alzheimer’s Evaluation).

For patient #1, MRI brain images were obtained with and without gadolinium contrast, on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner, with the following sequences: sagittal FLAIR, sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, axial T2, coronal FLAIR, coronal T2, axial SWI, and axial DWI. 18 FDG-PET images were obtained on a Siemens Biograph PET/CT scanner 45 minutes after injection with 5.5mCi of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose. For patient #2, 3T MRI brain images were obtained without contrast, with the following sequences: sagittal FLAIR, sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, axial T2, coronal T1, axial GRE, and axial DWI. All scans were performed for clinical purposes and interpreted by staff neuroradiologists.

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects undergoing genetic analysis. Five of six siblings of Patient #1 were enrolled in an IRB approved neurogenetics project at Baylor College of Medicine (H-13798) with informed consent. As described previously 28 , DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples was submitted for whole exome sequencing (Genet, Gaithersburg, MD). Sequencing produced more than 120× average depth of coverage per exome (median coverage = 115) per sample with >90% of the captured bases at >20× coverage depth. Raw sequencing reads were processed using the Codified ( https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/codified-genomics ) annotation platform 29 . Alleles with > 20× coverage and 40% allele fraction were considered for further analysis. The Similarity score (the proportion of the rare variants with MAF <0.5 shared among siblings was as expected, averaging 46% and ranging between 42% and 49%. We identified on average 707 total variants per exome (range 694–739) and an average of 131 variants per exome in known disease genes (range 124–138).
