# Title
Genome-wide association analyses identify new risk variants and the genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

# Abstract
To elucidate the genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and find associated loci, we assembled a custom imputation reference panel from whole-genome-sequenced patients with ALS and matched controls ( n = 1,861). Through imputation and mixed-model association analysis in 12,577 cases and 23,475 controls, combined with 2,579 cases and 2,767 controls in an independent replication cohort, we fine-mapped a new risk locus on chromosome 21 and identified C21orf2 as a gene associated with ALS risk. In addition, we identified MOBP and SCFD1 as new associated risk loci. We established evidence of ALS being a complex genetic trait with a polygenic architecture. Furthermore, we estimated the SNP-based heritability at 8.5%, with a distinct and important role for low-frequency variants (frequency 1–10%). This study motivates the interrogation of larger samples with full genome coverage to identify rare causal variants that underpin ALS risk.

## ONLINE METHODS
The software packages used, their version, web source and references are described in Supplementary Table 18 .

Details on the acquired genotype data from previously published GWAS are described in Supplementary Table 1 . Methods for case and control ascertainment for each cohort are described in the Supplementary Note . All cases and controls gave written informed consent, and the relevant institutional review boards approved this study. To obtain genotype data for newly genotyped individuals, genomic DNA was hybridized to the Illumina OmniExpress array according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequent quality control included (i) removing low-quality SNPs and individuals from each cohort, (ii) combining unbalanced cohorts on the basis of nationality and genotyping platform to form case–control strata, (iii) removing low-quality SNPs, related individuals and population outliers per stratum and (iv) calculating genomic inflation factors per stratum. More details are described in the Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figure 11 . The number of SNPs and individuals failing each quality control step per cohort and stratum is displayed in Supplementary Tables 2–5 .

Individuals were whole-genome sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using PCR-free library preparation and 100-bp paired-end sequencing, yielding a minimum of 35× coverage. Reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome build, and after variant calling (Isaac variant caller) additional SNV and sample quality control was performed ( Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Note ). Individuals in our custom reference panel were also included in the GWAS in strata sNL2, sNL3 and sNL4.

All high-quality calls in the custom reference panel were phased using SHAPEIT2 software. After checking strand and allele inconsistencies, both the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (release 05-21-2011) 31 and custom reference panel were imputed up to the union of their variants as described previously 32 . Variants with inconsistent allele frequencies between the two panels were removed.

To compare the imputation accuracy between different reference panels, 109 unrelated ALS cases of Dutch ancestry sequenced by Complete Genomics and 67 ALS cases from the UK sequenced by Illumina were selected as a test panel. All variants not present on the Illumina Omni1M array were masked, and the SNVs on chromosome 20 were subsequently imputed back using four different reference panels (1000 Genomes Project, GoNL, custom panel and merged panel). Concordance between the imputed alleles and sequenced alleles was assessed in each allele frequency bin where allele frequencies were calculated from the Dutch samples included in the Genome of the Netherlands cohort.

Prephasing was performed for each stratum using SHAPEIT2 with the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 (release 05-21-2011) hap-lotypes 31 as a reference panel. Subsequently, strata were imputed up to the merged reference panel in 5-Mb chunks using IMPUTE2. Imputed variants with a MAF <1% or INFO score <0.3 were excluded from further analysis. Variants with allele frequency differences between strata, defined as deviating by >10 s.d. from the normalized mean allele frequency difference between those strata and an absolute difference >5%, were excluded because they are likely to represent sequencing or genotyping artifacts. Imputation concordance scores for cases and controls were compared to assess biases in imputation accuracy ( Supplementary Table 19 ).

Logistic regression was performed on imputed genotype dosages under an additive model using SNPTEST software. On the basis of scree plots, one to four principal components were included per stratum. These results were then combined in an inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis using METAL. No marked heterogeneity across strata was observed as the Cochrane’s Q test statistics did not deviate from the null distribution ( λ = 0.96). Therefore, no SNPs were removed owing to excessive heterogeneity. The genomic inflation factor was calculated, and the quantile–quantile plot is provided in Supplementary Figure 3a .

All strata were combined including SNPs that passed quality control in every stratum. Subsequently, genetic relationship matrices (GRMs) were calculated for each chromosome including all SNPs using the Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software package. Each SNP was then tested in an LMM including a GRM composed of all chromosomes excluding the target chromosome (leave one chromosome out, LOCO). The genomic inflation factor was calculated, and the quantile–quantile plot is provided as Supplementary Figure 3b .

For the replication phase, independent ALS cases and controls from Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey that were not used in the discovery phase were included. A pre-designed TaqMan genotyping assay was used to replicate rs75087725 and rs616147. Sanger sequencing was performed to replicate rs10139154 and rs7813314 ( Supplementary Table 20 and Supplementary Note ). All genotypes were tested in a logistic regression per country and subsequently underwent meta-analysis.

The burden of nonsynonymous rare variants in C21orf2 was assessed in whole-genome sequencing data obtained from ALS cases and controls from the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, the UK and the United States. After quality control, the burden of nonsynonymous and loss-of-function mutations in C21orf2 was tested for association in each country and meta-analysis was subsequently performed. More details are provided in the Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figure 13 .

To assess the predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores in an independent data set, SNP weights were assigned on the basis of the LMM (GCTA-LOCO) analysis in 18 of 27 strata. SNPs in high LD ( r 2 >0.5) in a 250-kb window were clumped. Subsequently, polygenic risk scores for cases and controls in the nine independent strata were calculated on the basis of their genotype dosages using PLINK v1.9. To obtain the Nagelkerke r 2 and corresponding P values, these scores were then regressed on their true phenotype in a logistic regression where (on the basis of scree plots) the first three principal components, sex and stratum were included as covariates.

GRMs were calculated using GCTA software including genotype dosages passing quality control in all strata. On the basis of the diagonal of the GRM, individuals representing subpopulations that contained an abundance of rare alleles (diagonal values mean ±2 s.d.) were removed ( Supplementary Fig. 14a ). Pairs where relatedness (off-diagonal) exceeded 0.05 were removed as well ( Supplementary Fig. 14b ). The eigenvectors for the first ten principal components were included as fixed effects to account for more subtle population structure. The prevalence of ALS was defined as the lifetime morbid risk for ALS (that is, 1 in 400) 21 . To estimate the SNP-based heritability for all non-genome-wide-significant SNPs, the genotypes for the SNPs reaching genome-wide significance were modeled as fixed effects. The variance explained by the GRM therefore reflects the SNP-based heritability of all non-genome-wide-significant SNPs. SNP-based heritability partitioned by chromosome or MAF was calculated by including multiple GRMs, calculated on SNPs from each chromosome or in the respective frequency bin, in one model.

The phenotype correlation–genotype correlation (PCGC) regression software package was used to calculate heritability on the basis of the Haseman–Elston regression including the eigenvectors for the first ten principal components as covariates. The prevalence was again defined as the lifetime morbid risk (1 in 400).

Summary statistics from GCTA-LOCO and LD scores calculated from European individuals in 1000 Genomes Project were used for LD score regression. Associated SNPs ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) and variants not in HapMap 3 were excluded. Considering adequate correction for population structure and distant relatedness in the LMM, the intercept was constrained to 1.0 (ref. 12 ).

Functional interpretation of associated GWAS loci was carried out using DEPICT, using locus definition based on 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 data. This method prioritizes genes in the affected loci and predicts involved pathways, biological processes and tissues, using gene co-regulation data from 77,840 expression arrays. Three separate analyses were performed for GWAS loci reaching P = 1 × 10 −4 , P = 1 × 10 −5 or P = 1 × 10 −6 . One thousand permutations were used for adjusting the nominal enrichment P values for biases and additionally 200 permutations were used for FDR calculation.
