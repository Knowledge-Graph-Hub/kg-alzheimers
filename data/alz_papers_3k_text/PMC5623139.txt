# Title
Massively-parallel single nucleus RNA-seq with DroNc-seq

# Abstract
Single nucleus RNA-seq (sNuc-seq) profiles RNA from tissues that are preserved or cannot be dissociated, but does not
provide the throughput required to analyse many cells from complex tissues. Here, we develop DroNc-seq, massively parallel
sNuc-Seq with droplet technology. We profile 39,111 nuclei from mouse and human archived brain samples to demonstrate sensitive,
efficient and unbiased classification of cell types, paving the way for systematic charting of cell atlases.

## ONLINE METHODS
See Protocol Exchange 21 for a step-by-step protocol for DroNc-seq.

Microfluidic devices were designed using AutoCAD (AutoDESK, USA), tested using COMSOL Multiphysics as well as
empirically, and fabricated using soft lithographic techniques 22 ( Supplementary Data 1 ). The devices were tested on a Drop-seq setup,
using bare beads (Tosoh, Japan, Cat # HW-65s) in Drop-Seq Lysis Buffer (DLB 7 ; 10 ml stock consists of 4 ml of nuclease-free H 2 O, 3 ml 20% Ficoll PM−400
(Sigma, Cat # F5415-50ML), 100 μl 20% Sarkosyl (Teknova, Cat # S3377), 400 μl 0.5M
EDTA (Life Technologies), 2 ml 1M Tris pH 7.5 (Sigma), and 500 μl 1M DTT (Teknova, Cat # D9750), where the DTT
is added fresh) and 1x PBS, to optimize flow and bead occupancy parameters in drops. Droplet generation was assessed under a
microscope in real time using a fast camera (Photron, Model # SA5), and later by sampling the emulsion using a
disposable hemocytometer (Life Technologies, Cat # 22-600-100) to check droplet integrity, size, and bead occupancy.
The device design is provided as a Supplementary File 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a . The unit in the CAD provided is 1 unit =
1 μm; channel depth on device is 75 μm.

3T3 and HEK293 cells were prepared as described 7 . TF1 cells were
cultured according to ATCC’s instructions. For DroNc-seq, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped with 2 ml nuclease-
and protease-free Nuclei EZ lysis or EZ PREP buffer (Sigma, Cat # EZ PREP NUC-101) and processed as tissues, described
below.

Microdissections of mouse hippocampus and PFC were performed under stereomicroscope 3 . Dissected sub-regions were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until
processed for nuclei isolation. To validate DroNc-seq for fixed tissue ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ), sub-regions were placed in ice-cold RNA later (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Cat # AM7020), stored at 4°C overnight, after which RNA later was removed and samples were
stored at −80°C until processing.

Human hippocampus and PFC samples were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Samples were
originally collected from recently deceased, non-diseased donors 18 , 23 . For this study, we selected samples of frozen hippocampus and PFC from five male
donors, aged 40–65 (including three samples of PFC and four samples of hippocampus). We used RNA quality from tissues
as a proxy for tissue quality, and selected tissues with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values of 6.9 or higher (average RIN was
7.3). Average post-mortem ischemic interval for tissues was 12.4 hours ( Supplementary Table 6 ).

Nuclei were isolated with EZ PREP buffer (Sigma, Cat #NUC-101). Tissue samples cut into pieces < 0.5 cm or
cell pellets were homogenized using a glass dounce tissue grinder (Sigma, Cat #D8938) (25 times with pastel A, and 25
times with pastel B) in 2 ml of ice-cold EZ PREP and incubated on ice for 5 minutes, with additional 2 ml ice-cold EZ PREP.
Nuclei were centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C, washed with 4 ml ice-cold EZ PREP and incubated on ice for 5
minutes. After centrifugation, the nuclei were washed in 4 ml Nuclei Suspension Buffer (NSB; consisting of 1x PBS,
0.01% BSA and 0.1% RNAse inhibitor (Clontech, Cat #2313A)). Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml
NSB, filtered through a 35 μm cell strainer (Corning, Cat # 352235) and counted. A final concentration of
300,000 nuclei/ml was used for DroNc-seq experiments.

For comparison experiments of nuclei isolation protocols ( Supplementary Fig. 1c,d ), nuclei were also isolated using the sucrose gradient centrifugation method described for
sNuc-Seq 3 . The nuclei isolation protocol used here is more efficient
than the gradient centrifugation based method and does not require ultra-centrifugation. This reduced processing time and
minimized RNA degradation, facilitating processing of multiple samples.

10 μl of the single nuclei suspension in NSB (described above) was stained with DAPI (Fisher, Cat #
D1306), loaded on a hemocytometer, and checked under microscope to ensure that nuclei were adequately isolated into
singletons. The nuclei were suspended in NSB at ~300,000 nuclei/ml. Using ~75 um droplets, loading concentration of 300,000
nuclei/ml, and ~4.5 million drops/ml, amounts to a Poisson loading parameter, λ ~ 300,000/4,500,000=
0.07).

Barcoded beads (Chemgenes, Cat # Macosko-2011-10) were prepared as in Ref 7 . Because the DroNc-seq microfluidic device has narrow channels (~70 μm), they are likely to
clog from large beads, compared to Drop-seq. We therefore size-selected beads < 40 μm diameter using a strainer
(PluriSelect, Cat # 43-50040-03); in our experience, these smaller beads comprise roughly 55% of the purchased
bead pool. The barcoded beads were suspended in DLB (described above) and counted at 1:1 dilution in 20% PEG solution
using a hemocytometer (VWR, Cat # 22-600-102) 7 , at concentrations
between 325,000 and 350,000 per ml.

The nuclei and barcoded bead suspension were loaded 7 and flown at 1.5
ml/hr each, along with carrier oil (BioRad Sciences, Cat # 186-4006) at 16 ml/hr, to co-encapsulate single nuclei and
beads in ~75 μm drops (vol. ~ 200 pl) at 4,500 drops/sec and double Poisson loading concentrations. The smaller
droplet volume in DroNc-seq results in higher mRNA concentration in drops (> 5x) compared to 125 μm drops in
Drop-seq.

The theoretical Poisson loading concentration at 1/10 bead and nuclei occupancy for devices with channels 70
μm wide and 75 μm deep is ~520,000/ml, and 100 μm depth (also tested) is 340,000/ml. We tested bead
and cell loading at this and other concentrations using species-mixing experiments 7 ( e.g. , Supplementary Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1 ) and ease of bead flow as metrics and found
that beads at 350,000/ml and nuclei at 300,000/ml concentrations performed best, in terms of low human-mouse doublet rate and
fewer clogging events during droplet generation. At the nuclei loading concentrations used, the occurrence of one or more
nuclei in a drop follows a Poisson distribution, P(x) = λ x e −λ /x!, where λ = Poisson parameter, and x=2 for doublet
estimation. As a theoretical lower bound, increasing nuclei concentration will increase doublet rate as λ 2 e −λ /2; e.g., if nuclei loading is increased by 10%, the probability of getting two
nuclei in a drop will increase from 0.21% to 0.25%. However, the probability of getting two or more nuclei in a drop, i.e. , doublets, triplets, etc., all
of which would be indistinguishable in species-mixing experiments, is P(x ≥ 2; λ = 0.07) =
0.5%. In practice, nuclei that stick together or cellular debris could also contribute to doublets or doublet-like
phenomena. Empirical doublet rates in experiments ranged from ~1% (mouse tissue; clustering analysis) to ~5%
(species-mixing).

For nuclei experiments on human and mouse tissue, 75 μm DroNc-seq devices were used, except for where 125
μm Drop-seq device was used for comparison ( Supplementary Fig.
1b ). Note that for 3T3 nuclei , both 125 μm Drop-seq and 75 μm DroNc-seq devices
yielded similar results, while 3T3 cells profiled by Drop-seq had better efficiency
and complexity.

Microfluidic emulsion was collected into 50 ml Falcon tubes for ~22 min each, and left at room temperature for up to
45 min before breaking drops 7 and performing RT 7 .

Post RT, each barcoded bead had cDNA barcoded with the bead’s unique barcode (BC) bound onto it, also referred
to as a STAMP 7 . STAMPs from multiple collections of a given sample were
pooled at this point, resuspended in 1 mL H 2 O, and a 10 μl aliquot of the suspension was mixed with 10
μl of 20% PEG solution and counted. Aliquots of 5,000 beads were amplified 7 using the following PCR steps: 95°C for 3 min; then 4 cycles of: 98°C for 20 sec,
65°C for 45 sec, 72°C for 3 min; then X cycles of: 98°C for 20 sec, 67°C for 20 sec,
72°C for 3 min; and finally, 72°C for 5 min, where X was adjusted according to sample quality. STAMPs from
mouse tissue were amplified for X=10 cycles and PCR products were pooled in batches of 4 wells or 16 wells. STAMPS
from human tissue were amplified for X=10 or 12 cycles. Human PCR products were pooled in batches of 4 wells
(X=12) or 16 wells (X=10). Supernatants from each well were combined in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and cleaned
with 0.6X SPRI beads (Ampure XP, Beckman Coulter, Cat # A63881).

Notably, the number of PCR wells from a DroNc-seq run depends on the number of STAMPs obtained. A user may access the
STAMPs in different ways, depending on the number of nuclei they wish to sequence. One would either access the pool one time
or more, each time taking only a portion of the STAMPs to generate a library, and repeating the process if more is desired.
For mouse and human brain, it was optimal to use 5,000 STAMPs in each PCR reaction and then pool 4 PCR wells together for
library preparation, which is expected to yield 1,400 nuclei profiles based on our loading and flow parameters. Depending on
the desired number of reads per nucleus and sequencing yield, one can pool higher numbers of PCR wells in a single Illumina
Nextera ™ library, as demonstrated here using 16–32 wells for libraries used in the clustering
analysis of mouse and human brain tissue.

Purified cDNA was quantified 7 and 550 pg of each sample was
fragmented, tagged, and amplified in each Nextera reaction 7 .

The libraries were sequenced at 2.2 pM (mouse, 16 wells pool), 2.7 pM (mouse, 4 wells pool), and 2.3 pM (human) on an
Illumina NextSeq 500. We used NextSeq 75 cycle v3 kits to sequence 20bp and 64bp paired-end reads, with Custom Read1
primer 7 . The sequencing cluster density and percent passing filter
number from different experiments varied according to the quality of nuclei samples used, but were optimized around cluster
density of 220 and 90% passing filter.

Paired-end sequence reads were processed mostly as previously described 7 , 11 . Briefly, the left read was used to infer both the cell
of origin, based on the first 12 bases (the Nucleus Barcode or NB), and the molecule of origin, based on the next 8 bases
(Unique Molecular Index or UMI). Reads were first filtered by quality score, and the right mate of each read pair was
trimmed and aligned to the genome (mouse mm10 UCSC, human hg19 UCSC) using STAR v2.4.0a 24 . Reads mapping to exonic regions of genes as per the mouse UCSC genome (version
mm10) or the human UCSC genome (version hg19) were recorded.

Nucleus (cell) barcodes that represent genuine nuclei RNA libraries rather than technical and sequencing errors
were distinguished as previously described 7 , 11 as true or “core” nucleus barcodes. Briefly, barcodes were first filtered based
on a minimum number of transcripts associated with them and then barcodes were checked for synthesis errors and collapsed
to core barcodes if they were within an edit distance of 1. To account for amplification bias, gene counts were collapsed
within each sample, using UMI sequences (within an edit distance of 1, substitutions only), as previously
described 7 , 11 . The
expression count (or number of transcripts) for a given gene in a given nucleus was determined by counting unique UMIs,
and compiled into a digital gene expression (DGE) matrix. The DGE matrix was scaled by total UMI counts, multiplied by the
mean number of transcripts (calculated for each dataset separately) and the values were log transformed. To reduce the
effects of library quality and complexity on cluster identity, a linear model was used to regress out effects of the
number of transcripts and genes detected per nucleus (using the ‘RegressOut’ function in the Seurat
software package).

Nuclei with less than 200 detected genes and less than 10,000 usable reads were filtered out. We note that, as for
scRNA-seq, depending on the cell-type in question; the cut-off may need to be set on a case-by-case basis, based on the
characteristic RNA content of the cell type. A gene is considered detected in a cell if it has at least two unique UMIs
(transcripts) associated with it. For each analysis, genes were removed that were detected in less than 10 nuclei. After
filtering, the number of cells and nuclei were as follows: ( 1 ) 1,710 cells from the 3T3 single cell libraries
(collected by Drop-seq) across two replicates; ( 2 ) 5,636 3T3 nuclei across 6 replicates; ( 3 )
19,561 nuclei from the mouse brain (4 PFC samples and 4 hippocampus samples from 4 mice used for cell type analysis, and
an additional 8 cortical samples from 4 mice used for quality control experiments); and ( 4 ) 19,550 nuclei
from the human brain (3 PFC samples and 4 hippocampus samples from 5 donors). Clusters and cell-type classification were
robust for different gene detection thresholds. The above threshold was used in all the clustering analyses. For the
quality control experiments (specifically, testing the performance with RNA Later , different nuclei
isolation protocols, different microfluidic devices; Supplementary Fig.
1 ), at least 20,000 usable reads per nucleus were required (the number of reads at which we estimated sample
saturation; Supplementary Fig. 2f,g ). For the assessment of the
complexity and sensitivity of DroNc-seq at least 80,000 usable reads per nucleus were required; this analysis was
performed only with the samples sequenced deeply to an average of 160,000 reads per nucleus, as required for saturation
analysis.

A list of quality metrics was obtained for all DroNc-seq datasets using Samtools ( http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ ), Picard Tools ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ), and in-house scripts. For each single-nucleus profile, we
calculated the total number of reads mapped to coding regions and UTRs, number of genes detected per nucleus, and the
percentage of the total number of reads assigned to nucleus barcode that were from: ( 1 ) coding regions,
( 2 ) UTRs, ( 3 ) intronic regions, ( 4 ) intergenic regions, ( 5 )
ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and ( 6 ) transcripts derived from the mitochondrial genome.

We compared DroNc-seq (nuclei) and Drop-seq (cells) using several measures. ( 1 ) We compared the capture
rate efficiency of DroNc-seq and Drop-seq in libraries derived from pooling four PCR wells, followed by sequencing to an
average depth of 160,000 usable reads per nucleus/cell. The efficiency is defined as the percent of nuclei actually observed
out of the proportion expected per library, given the Poisson loading of 0.07 for DroNc-seq and 0.1 for
Drop-seq. For example, at 100% efficiency, a DroNc-seq pool of 20,000 beads is expected to contain 1,400 nuclei (2,000
cells in Drop-seq). On average, we observed 87% efficiency for DroNc-seq (78%, 89%, and 95%
efficiency for cell lines, mouse brain, and human brain tissue, respectively) and 72% for Drop-seq on cell lines.
( 2 ) We compared the means and the distributions of the number of genes and transcripts detected for all cells
and nuclei that pass our quality filter ( Supplementary Figure
2b–c ). ( 3 ) We compared the expression profiles of nuclei and cells (3T3 cell line) by
computing the average expression for each gene (average log transformed UMI counts) in each replicate, and then the Pearson
correlation coefficients between technical replicates of cells or nuclei (all have r =0.99+/−stdev=0.0023), and between nuclei and cells
( r =0.81+/−stdev= 0.0024). ( Supplementary Figure 2d ) ( 4 ) We tested for genes differentially expressed between cells and nuclei
(3T3 cell lines) after pooling technical replicates. We defined differentially expressed genes using Student’s t-test,
requiring FDR < 0.001, log-ratio > 1 and an average expression across all nuclei or cell samples log(UMI count) > 3.
We found only two genes up-regulated in the nuclei (lincRNAs Malat1 and Meg3 ), and 57 genes
up regulated in cells, including many mitochondrial RNAs and ribosomal protein RNAs (known to be stable and thus enriched in
cells compared to nuclei 13 , 14 ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ). ( 5 ) We compared the fraction of
the total number of reads that were mapped to ( 1 ) coding regions, ( 2 ) UTRs, ( 3 )
intronic regions, ( 4 ) intergenic regions, and ( 5 ) ribosomal RNA (as described above) ( Supplementary Figure 2e ).

To select highly variable genes, we fit a relationship between mean counts and coefficient of variation using a
Gamma distribution on the data from all the genes 19 , 25 , and ranked genes by the extent of excess variation as a function of their mean
expression (using a threshold of at least 0.2 difference in the coefficient of variation between the empirical and the
expected and a minimal mean transcript count of 0.005).

We used a DGE matrix consisting only of variable genes as defined above, scaled and log transformed, and then
reduced its dimensions with principal components analysis (PCA). We used the fast ‘rpca’ function in R
(package ‘rsvd’), and chose the most significant principal components (or PCs) based on the largest eigen
value gap 3 (separately for each dataset) to use as input in downstream
analysis.

We partitioned the profiles into clusters of transcriptionally similar nuclei using the top significant PCs as an
input to a graph based clustering algorithm, as previously described 11 .
Briefly, in the first step, we compute a k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) graph, connected each
nucleus to its k -nearest neighbors (based on Euclidean distance, using the ‘nng’ function
of the ‘igraph’ package in R). We next used the k -NN graph as an input to the Infomap
algorithm 26 , which decomposes an input graph into modules using
the ‘cluster_infomap’ function in R). The clustering results were visualized by coloring a tSNE 27 2D map post hoc (below). We used k =100 for clustering of each full dataset, and k =80 for the human brain
subset clustering ( Fig. 2f , Supplementary Fig. 8–9 ).

To identify subtypes of cells, the same analyses were performed as described above but on a specific subset of
nuclei (one or few of the major clusters; as described in the main text) to partition it to sub-clusters.

We generated a two-dimensional (2D) non-linear embedding of the nuclei profiles using tSNE. The scores along the
top significant PCs estimated above were used as input to the algorithm (using the ‘Rtsne’ package, with a
maximum of 2,000 iterations, disabling the initial PCA step and setting the perplexity parameter to 100 for detection of
the major clusters and 60 for sub-clusters). Since tSNE can produce different visualizations in different runs, we used
these coordinates only for visualization and not to identify cell clusters. Interestingly, we can associate nuclei with a
distinct known cell type even for those nuclei with as few as 100 genes detected, suggesting that the cell-type identity
in the brain can be encoded by a small set of genes, easily detected with shallow sequencing, as previously observed in
other systems 11 .

To visualize the expression of known marker genes ( e.g. , subtypes of GABAergic neurons in the
hippocampus and cortex 3 , 19 ) or
genes found to be up-regulated, we visualized the average expression of the markers across each cluster or cell type as
violin plots, and visualized the distribution of the expression across cells in the tSNE space by color coding the dots
based on expression levels.

To rule out the possibility that the resulting clusters are driven by batch or other technical effects, we
examined the distribution of samples within each cluster and the distribution of the number of genes detected across
clusters (as a measure of nuclei quality). Overall, the nuclei separated into distinct point clouds in tSNE space that
were not driven by batch; each cluster/cloud was an admixture of cells from all technical and biological replicates, with
variable numbers of genes. Related to the number of genes, we note that there is a distinct biological difference in cell
size (and expected RNA content) between neuronal and glial cells in the brain.

To assess the extent of saturation and required read depth of the DroNc-seq libraries, we used nuclei libraries from a
mouse cell line (3T3), mouse brain tissue, and human brain tissue (cortex) each sequenced to an average read depth of 160,000
reads per nucleus. We removed nuclei with less than either 200 genes detected or 10,000 reads. We performed saturation
analyses for transcripts (UMI) and genes for each nucleus separately by sub-sampling reads with replacement across the range
of reads for that nucleus (from 0.02 to 0.98 of the total read counts within a given nucleus or cell, in 0.02 increments). For
each subsampling, we calculated the number of reads and transcripts detected. This sampling procedure was repeated 10 times
and the mean values were reported. Saturation limits for UMI/genes were estimated by nonlinear fitting of the following
saturation function to all points generated by the sampling procedure: y = a x ( b + x ) + c

Major cell-type clusters were identified by using a set of known cell-type marker genes from the literature, as
previously described 3 , 19 . In addition,
we identified signatures of up-regulated genes for each cluster ( Supplementary Tables 4,5,8 and 9 ), which we used to further validate the identity of the cluster by matching these
signatures with canonical cell-type marker genes and by testing for enriched pathways. Differentially expressed signatures
were calculated using a binomial likelihood ratio test 28 to find genes that
are up-regulated within each cluster compared to the rest of the nuclei in the dataset, with FDR 0.01 and requiring that these
genes are expressed in at least 20% of nuclei in the given cluster and have a minimum difference of 20% in the
fraction of nuclei in which they are detected. The differential expression signatures were tested for enriched pathways and
gene sets using a hypergeometric test (FDR < 0.01). Pathways were taken from the MSigDB/GSEA resource (combining data from
Hallmark pathways, REACTOME, KEGG, GO and BIOCARTA) 29 .

We flagged problematic clusters to be disregarded in downstream analysis by any one of three criteria:
( 1 ) clusters that had dubious quality of nuclei, in which the nuclei associated mainly with one sample did not
associate with specific cell type markers. ( 2 ) clusters with nuclei expressing both overlapping markers of two
different cell types and having a relatively higher number of transcripts, indicating they might be nuclei doublets; or
( 3 ) clusters expressing markers of neighboring brain regions that might be a result of non-specific tissue
dissection (such as genes enriched in the choroid plexus, Supplementary Fig.
3b ). Several small clusters in the human and mouse brain were discarded from downstream analysis (as annotated in Supplementary Tables 3 and 7 , and in Supplementary Fig. 3b ).

Cell types were defined by combining clusters of all subtypes ( e.g. the GABAergic sub-clusters were
combined into one group of GABAergic neurons), which was used in the downstream analysis for testing the number of genes and
transcripts in each cell type, defining cell-type specific expression signatures, sub-clustering, and comparing cell-type
signatures to previous datasets.

Cell-type specific expression patterns were compared to signatures previously defined in several relevant datasets
by calculating the pairwise Pearson correlations coefficients between each pair of cell types in the other dataset and
DroNc-seq datasets for the same set of genes. First , we compared to average cell-type specific signatures
from sNuc-Seq analysis in the mouse hippocampus 3 (Supplementary Tables in
Ref. 3 ). Second , we compared to the single cell RNA-seq
dataset of the mouse visual cortex (Tasic et al. 17 ),
using the previously defined cell-type annotations and expression values per cell (from GEO dataset GSE71585 and Ref. 17 ). Average log transformed TPM counts, FPKM counts, or scaled
UMI counts were used to generate the mouse hippocampus 3 , mouse visual
cortex 17 , and DroNc-seq signatures, respectively.

To determine the congruence of cell subtypes between the DroNc-seq analyses to other neural datasets, we adopted
an approach which we previously described in an analysis of retinal neurons 11 . Briefly, we trained a multi-class random forest classifier 30 on the clusters defined on the DroNc-seq data separately for human and mouse GABAergic neurons.
In each case, we used the most variable genes (approximately 700–2,000 genes across datasets, as described above)
to build a classifier on 60% of the data (training set). For each dataset, the classifier was tested on the
remaining 40% of the data that was not used for training (test set) to obtain an estimate of the classification
accuracy. Nuclei in the test set mapped to their correct classes at a rate of 93% for the human GABAergic neurons
and 91% for the mouse GABAergic neurons (expected accuracy based on random assignment was 12.5%). These
classifiers were then used to map cells or nuclei in other datasets including single nucleus RNA-seq in the mouse
hippocampus brain region 3 and single cell RNA-seq in the mouse visual
cortex 17 .

To determine the congruence of neuron subtypes between DroNc-Seq analysis of hippocampus and PFC and previous
analyses of human visual cortex (Lake et al . 4 ), we used
the classifier previously defined in Lake et al. 4 that
includes a set of signature genes at each point along a decision tree leading to the classification of eight GABAergic
subtypes. To classify the DroNc-seq nuclei profiles, at each branch point in the tree, we scored each nucleus profile
using the left and right gene signatures, by the average expression level of all signature genes per nucleus (log
transformed UMI counts centered around the mean value), and assigned the tested nucleus by the higher score.

RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) images for marker genes was taken from the Allen Institute Brain
Atlas 31 .
