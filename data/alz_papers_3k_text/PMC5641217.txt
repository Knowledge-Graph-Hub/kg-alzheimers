# Title
ApoE4 markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a mouse
model of tauopathy

# Abstract
APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). ApoE4 increases brain
amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology relative to other ApoE
isoforms 1 . However,
whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other
major proteinopathy of AD and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated
neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on
either a human ApoE knockin (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, we show that
P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a greater
extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by 3 months of age compared to
P301S/E2, P301S/E3 and P301S/EKO mice. By 9 months of age, P301S mice with
different ApoE genotypes display distinct p-tau staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice
develop markedly more brain atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and
P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these changes.
In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate immune reactivity
following LPS treatment. Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with
E4-expressing mixed glia results in a significantly higher level of TNFα
secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability compared to neuron/E2 and
neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest
viability with the lowest level of secreted TNFα. Treatment of P301S
neurons with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage
and death compared to the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect.
In individuals with a sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more severe regional
neurodegeneration. In Aβ-pathology positive individuals with symptomatic
AD who usually have tau pathology, ε4 -carriers
demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that
ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated
neurodegeneration independent of Aβ pathology. ApoE4 exerts a
“toxic” gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is
protective.

## Methods
Human ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 knockin (KI) mice (C57BL/6) were provided
by Dr. Patrick M. Sullivan (Duke University) and ApoE knockout (KO) mice
(C57BL/6) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (#002052). P301S
tau transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, #008169) on a B6/C3
background expressing human P301S 1N4R tau driven by PrP promoter were crossed
to human ApoE KI mice to generate P301S hE/hE mice for all three ApoE isoforms,
which were then crossed to ApoE KO mice to generate P301S hE/− mice.
Separately, ApoE KI mice were crossed to ApoE KO mice to generate hE/−
mice. P301S hE/− mice were then crossed with hE/− mice to
generate P301S hE/hE, P301S hE/− and P301S −/−
littermates for all three ApoE isoforms. All tau transgenic mice for final
analysis were kept at the same generation and had ~90% C57BL/6
background by congenic test. Only male ApoE homozygote and knockout mice were
used for analysis. P301S ApoE KO mice derived from three ApoE isoforms showed no
difference in analysis and were combined as one single group (TEKO). WT mice
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (#027) on a C57BL/6
background and were bred separately from the P301S/ApoE mice. Due to a slightly
different background of the WT mice, we did not perform statistical analysis
comparing WT to other mice. All animal procedures and experiments were performed
under guidelines approved by the animal studies committee at Washington
University School of Medicine. Sample sizes were chosen based on estimates to
provide 80% power to see significant differences of 20% or
greater.

The left hemi-brain of each mouse was sectioned coronally at 50
μm using a freezing sliding microtome. Three sections from each mouse
(300 um apart), corresponding approximately to bregma coordinates −1.4,
−1.7, and −2.0 mm respectively, were used for p-tau staining
described by Yanamandra et al 25 . Briefly, brain sections were washed in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) buffer for 3 times followed by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide in TBS for 10 min at RT. After three washes in TBS, sections were
blocked with 3% milk in 0.25% TBS-X (Triton X-100) for 0.5 h
followed by incubation at 4°C overnight with biotinylated AT8 antibody
(Thermo Scientific, MN1020B, 1:500). The next day, the slices were developed
using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector laboratories) following
manufacturer’s instructions. Stained sections were imaged by the
NanoZoomer digital pathology system and pathology was quantified using Image J.
For immunofluorescence, two sections (bregma −1.7mm and −2.0mm
for CD68, bregma −2.3mm and −2.6mm for GFAP) from each mouse
were used. The sections were washed in TBS 3 times, and blocked with 3%
BSA in 0.25% TBS-X for 0.5h at RT, followed by overnight incubation at
4°C with primary antibodies (CD68: AbD SeroTec, MCA1957, 1:500; GFAP:
EMD Millipore, MAB3402, 1:2000). The next day, the sections were washed in TBS
and incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular probes,
1:500) for 2h at RT. The slices were then washed and mounted in prolong gold
antifade mounting media (Molecular probes, P36931). Images were taken with an
epi-fluorescence microscope at 4× magnification and quantified using
MetaMorph.

Every sixth coronal brain section (300 um between sections) starting
rostrally at bregma +2.1mm to the dorsal end of the hippocampus at
bregma −3.9 mm were mounted for each mouse. All mounted sections were
stained with 0.1% Sudan black in 70% ethanol at RT for 20 min,
then washed in 70% ethanol for 1 min, 3 times. The sections were finally
washed in Milli-Q water for 3 times and coverslipped with Fluoromount. The
stained slices were imaged with the NanoZoomer and areas of interest were traced
and measured in each slice using the NDP viewer. The volume was calculated using
the following formula: volume = (sum of area) * 0.3 mm. For
hippocampus and posterior lateral ventricle, quantification started from bregma
−1.1 and ended at bregma −3.9. For piriform/entorhinal cortex,
quantification started at bregma −2.3 and ended at bregma
−3.9.

Three sections (bregma −1.4, −1.7, and −2.0 mm)
from each mouse were mounted and stained in cresyl violet for 5 min at RT. The
slices were then sequentially dehydrated in 50%, 70%,
95% (3 times) and 100% ethanol (twice) for 1min, then cleared in
xylene for 4min (twice), and coverslipped in cytoseal60 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, 8310-16). The thickness of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and dentate
gyrus granular cell layer were measured by drawing a scale perpendicular to the
cell layer at two spots in all three slices and taking the average value for
each mouse.

Mouse cortex was processed in RAB, RIPA and 70% FA buffer
sequentially as described previously 25 with modifications. Briefly, the tissue was weighed and
homogenized using a pestle with 10ul buffer/1mg tissue in RAB buffer (100mM MES,
1mM EGTA, 0.5mM MgSO4, 750mM NaCl, 20mM NaF, 1mM Na3VO4, pH=7.0,
supplemented by protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors
(PhosSTOP, Roche)). After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, the
supernatant was taken as the RAB-soluble fraction and the pellet was dissolved
in RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5mM EDTA, 20mM NaF, 1mM Na3VO4, pH 8.0,
supplemented by Complete and PhosSTOP) at 10ul buffer/1mg tissue by sonication.
After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was taken
as the RIPA-soluble fraction. The pellet was sonicated in 70% formic
acid at 10ul buffer/1mg tissue, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20
min. The supernatant was taken as the FA-soluble fraction. All fractions were
stored in −80°C until analyzed.

Human tau and ApoE ELISAs were performed as described
previously 25 . For
coating antibodies, Tau5 (gift from L. Binder, Northwestern University, Chicago,
IL) was used for human tau ELISA, and HJ15.6 (in house-made anti-human ApoE
antibody) was used for human ApoE ELISA. For detection antibodies, biotinylated
HT7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MN1000B) was used for tau ELISA and biotinylated
HJ15.4 (in house-made anti-human ApoE antibody) was used for human ApoE
ELISA.

Mouse cortex was homogenized by sonication in RIPA buffer supplemented
with Complete and PhosSTOP. Samples were separated by 4–12%
NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gel using MOPS buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Primary antibodies anti-GFAP (Millipore, MAB 3402), anti-GAPDH
(Abcam, ab9484), anti-ApoE (Abcam, ab24139), anti-α tubulin (Sigma,
T5168) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used for
detection. Membranes were developed using Lumigen TMA6 (GE Healthcare).

RNAs were isolated from mouse cortex using RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN,74104), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the high capacity
RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, #4387406). Quantitative PCR were
performed using Taqman primers and probes with Taqman universal PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems, #4304437).

RNAs were isolated from mouse hippocampus using RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN,74104). We performed nCounter multiplexed target profiling of 534
microglial transcripts with a custom designed microglial gene chip (MG550) using
the Nanostring nCounter technology ( nanostring.com ), which allows
analysis of up to 800 genes from a single sample. Selection of genes was based
on genes and proteins specifically or highly expressed in adult homeostatic
microglia 26 plus 150
inflammation-related genes which were significantly affected in EAE, APP-PS1 and
SOD1 mice 27 . Using this
signature, we generated a new version (v3) of Nanostring-based microglia chip
termed MG550. For each sample, 100ng RNAs were used for hybridization, and all
data were normalized to 6 housekeeping genes: Cltc, Gapdh, Gusb, Hprt1, Pgk1,
and Tubb5.

Total RNA was extracted from mouse cortex using the RNeasy Plus kit
(Qiagen) and microfluidic qRT-PCR was performed as described 16 .

Primary neurons were obtained from E17 WT mouse (Charles River,
#022) fetuses. Hippocampi were dissected in calcium- and magnesium-free
Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) with careful strip of meninges.
Tissue was digested in HBSS containing 0.25% trypsin (GIBCO
#15090-046) and 0.2mg/ml DNase (Sigma #DN-25) at 37 °C
for 10 min, and was dissociated in HBSS containing 0.4mg/ml DNase using a
fire-polished Pasteur glass pipette and filtered through a 70-μm nylon
mesh. Filtered material was pelleted at 1000 g for 5 min, washed with neurobasal
medium (Neurobasal + 1x B27 + 1x pen/strep + 1x
L-glutamine) once, and infected with AAV2/8-synapsin-P301S tau virus for 3h on
ice. Cells were then pelleted, washed, and plated onto 24-well tissue culture
plates over glass cover slips that had been coated with 10 μg/ml
Poly-L-lysine (PLL, Sigma, #P2636) at a density of 20,000 cells/well in
neurobasal medium. For all cell culture experiments, only the central wells of
the plates were used with the peripheral wells filled with 1ml autoclaved ddH2O
to avoid different rates of medium evaporation during the culture. Recombinant
ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 (Leinco, #A215, A218, A219) were added to the
medium (10ug/ml) at the time of plating. Neurons were kept for 3 weeks with
addition of 200 ul fresh recombinant ApoE-containing medium (10 μg/ml)
each well every week, and were then stained with MAP2 antibody (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, #OSM00030W) for analysis and with HT7B (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, #MN1000B) antibody to confirm tau expression.

E2, E3, E4 and EKO glia were obtained from P2 pups from the respective
human ApoE KI or ApoE KO mice. Cortex was dissected and dissociated in the same
way as with neuron isolation. Cells were plated in glial medium (DMEM +
10% FBS + 1x Pen/strep + 1x Glutamax). Once monolayers
were confluent, cells were replated in 24-well plates over glass cover slips
coated with geltrex (Gibco, #A1413201) at a density of 75,000
cells/well, and allowed to grow for 2 days in glia medium. The glia were then
washed with 1 ml neurobasal medium (Neurobasal + 2% B27
+ 1x pen/strep + 1x L-glutamine) and placed in 400 μl
neurobasal medium before use. Primary neurons expressing P301S tau were prepared
as described above, and were directly plated on top of the glia at a density of
20,000 cells/well. The co-cultures were kept for 3 weeks with addition of 200
μl fresh neurobasal medium each well every week. Neurons were then
stained with MAP2 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #OSM00030W) for
analysis and with HT7B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #MN1000B) antibody to
confirm tau expression.

Mixed glia culture from ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4 KI mice were prepared as
described above in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5ng/ml
GM-CSF. Loosely attached microglia were harvested at DIV12 by shaking for 2
hours at 400 rpm and then seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates coated with
PLL at a density of 1×10 6 cells per well. The next day,
seeded microglia were washed in serum-free medium (SFM-DMEM/F12 +
0.2% BSA +1x pen/strep) and placed in 450 μl SFM. Cells
were then treated with 1 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, #L5293) for 24h. Medium were
collected and spun down at 10,000g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and
assayed for mouse TNFα, IL-1α and IL-1β using single
cytokine ELISAs (Bon Opus Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All cytokine levels were normalized to microglial protein levels
determined by BCA assay.

Cells were fixed in DPBS containing 4% PFA and 4%
sucrose at RT for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.3% PBST for 10min.
After blocking in 0.1% PBS-Triton X-100 containing 3% BSA and
3% goat serum for 30min at RT, cells were incubated in primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C. The next day, cells were washed with
0.1% PBST for 3 times and incubated in secondary antibodies for 1h at
RT. Cells were then washed 3 times in 0.1% PBST and mounted in prolong
gold antifade mounting media (Molecular probes, P36931). Images were taken with
an epi-fluorescence microscope at 10× magnification and quantified using
MetaMorph.

We searched the University of California, San Francisco
Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank database for patients with APOE genotyping and a pathological diagnosis of CBD,
Pick’s disease, or PSP, the three most common sporadic forms of
FTLD-tau. Authorization for autopsy was provided by patient’s
next-of-kin, and procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on Human
Research. We constrained our search to patients autopsied since 2007, when
systematic, prospective recording of neuropathological findings began. Such data
were available from 29 patients with CBD, 17 with Pick’s disease, and 33
with PSP. Demographics and relevant variables are shown in Extended Data Table 1a .

Postmortem brains were processed as previously described 28 . Fixed tissue slabs were
dissected into blocks representing dementia-relevant brain regions, embedded in
paraffin wax, and cut into 8 microns-thick sections. Regional neurodegeneration
was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Neuronal loss,
astrogliosis and microvacuolation were semi-quantitatively graded as absent (0),
mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). A similar scheme was used to rate
Aβ deposits (neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques and vascular amyloid-beta
deposits) 29 , tau
inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles, Pick bodies, globose tangles, neuronal
cytoplasmic inclusions (other than those listed previously), tufted astrocytes,
thorny astrocytes, astrocytic plaques, neuropil threads, and other glial
cytoplasmic inclusions), α-synuclein inclusions (Lewy bodies and Lewy
neurites), and TDP-43 inclusions (neuronal intranuclear inclusions, neuronal
cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, glial cytoplasmic inclusions).
Composite scores of neurodegeneration (ND score) [(microvacuolation
+ astrogliosis)/2) + neuronal loss] and for tau,
Aβ, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 were generated for each region by
summing scores across inclusion types for each pathological protein.

We limited analyses to regions that had been stained for all four
pathological proteins. This approach yielded a total of 609 regional assessments
across the 79 patients, with an average of 8 regions per patient. Hippocampal
CA1-4, subiculum, dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex were the most commonly
assessed regions and available in 72 of 79 patients. Additional regions
available from no less than 15 patients included midbrain subregions (oculomotor
nucleus, tectum, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe and substantia nigra);
anterior cingulate cortex; and middle frontal gyrus ( Extended Data Table 1b ). A linear mixed effects
model conducted at the brain regional level was used to determine the influence
of multiple predictors on composite neurodegeneration scores. APOE ε4
carrier status was used as the binary predictor of interest; additional fixed
effects in the model included tau, Aβ, TDP-43, and α-synuclein
composite scores; sex; age; pathological diagnosis; rater; and brain region.
Patient identity was modeled as a random effect. The primary hypothesis was that
possession of an ApoE E4 allele would be associated with greater regional
neurodegeneration after controlling for tau pathological burden and other
relevant predictors.

Participants from this study are part from two different longitudinal
studies, the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington
University and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Details of the Knight ADRC and ADNI studies are listed in the Supplementary
Information . All procedures were approved by the Washington University
Human Research Protection Office, and written informed consent was obtained from
each participant.

Unless explicitly stated, all mouse and cell culture data were shown as
mean ± SEM. Differences between groups were evaluated by one-way
analysis of variance tests with post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons
tests. For all experiments, data normality was analyzed using
D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. For data not following normal
distribution, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test
was performed for statistical analysis, and was stated in the figure legend.
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was
used for these analyses and creation of the plots. For statistical analysis of
the p-tau staining pattern distribution, two-sided Fisher’s exact tests
were performed using the “fisher.test” function in R version
3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for all four TE groups
together as well as for individual comparisons between each two groups.

Disease progression rate in a cohort of 592 CSF biomarker confirmed
individuals with symptomatic AD from two different longitudinal studies, the
Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington
University and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI). Data generated based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes
(CDR-SB) scores. Possession of the ε4 allele significantly
accelerated disease progression (p=0.02), with one ε4 allele
increasing progression rate by 14% and two ε4 alleles
increasing the rate by 23% compared to non-carriers (lineal mixed
model, two-sided).

a , ApoE is essential for neuronal death under
pathological conditions. With pathological tau accumulation, the presence of
ApoE, especially ApoE4, renders the neurons more susceptible to
degeneration, whereas the absence of ApoE protects neurons from death,
resulting in neurodegeneration
(E4>E3≈E2>>EKO). Degenerating neurons
further induce neuroinflammation, which is augmented by ApoE4 due to its
inherent higher innate immune reactivity, thereby exacerbating
neurodegeneration furthermore. Neuroinflammation may concomitantly affect
tau pathology 13 , resulting
in various p-tau staining types that could also contribute to
neurodegeneration. b , ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, resulting
in different p-tau patterns, which may possess distinct neurotoxicity
(type4>type3≈type2>type1), leading to different
levels of neuronal death and brain atrophy
(E4>E3≈E2>>EKO). Neuroinflammation
accompanying neurodegeneration will in turn exacerbate neuronal death. c , ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, resulting in different
p-tau patterns that may have different capacities to induce
neuroinflammation (type4>type3≈type2>type1), which
eventually leads to various degrees of neurodegeneration.

a , Demographics and relevant variables of patients.
Brain regional neurodegeneration was analyzed using post mortem
neuropathological data from a collection of 79 human primary tauopathy
patients with sporadic FTLD-tau: 29 with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), 17
with Pick’s disease, and 33 with progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP). Among these patients, 19 were ε4 carriers.
Possession of an ε4 allele was associated with more
severe regional neurodegeneration (linear mixed effects model, estimate
0.31, p=0.035, 95% CI [0.02, 0.59]) after
controlling for age, sex, diagnosis, rater, Aβ deposition, Lewy body
disease, tau burden, and TDP-43 inclusion burden. Greater regional
neurodegeneration was found as a function of tau burden (estimate 0.17,
p<0.001. 95% CI [0.14, 0.20]) and TDP-43
proteinopathy (estimate 0.22, p=0.003, 95%CI [0.07,
0.37]), whereas Aβ deposition was associated with less
severe neurodegeneration (estimate −0.08, p=0.044,
95%CI [−0.15, −0.002]). Lewy body
disease, which was relatively uncommon in this cohort, showed no effect
(estimate −0.01, p=0.87, 95% CI
[−0.17, 0.15]). b , Brain regions used
for analysis.
