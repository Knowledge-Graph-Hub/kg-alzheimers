# Title
Gamma frequency entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies
microglia

# Abstract
Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several
neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma and cellular
pathologies is unclear. Here, we show reduced behaviorally-driven gamma before
the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Optogenetically driving FS-PV-interneurons at
gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduced levels of
amyloid- β (A β ) 1-40 and A β 1-42 isoforms. Gene expression
profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological
transformation of microglia and histological analysis confirmed increased
microglia co-localization with A β . Subsequently, we
designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering paradigm that reduced A β 1-40 and A β 1-42 levels in visual cortex of
pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our
findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in
recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate AD-associated
pathology.

## Gamma is decreased during hippocampal sharp wave ripples in 5XFAD mice early in
disease
Altered gamma has been observed in multiple brain regions in several
neurological and psychiatric disorders, including a reduction in spontaneous gamma
synchronization in AD patients and reduced gamma power in multiple AD mouse
models. 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 However, it is unclear if gamma is
altered in other mouse models of AD, if it occurs early in disease progression, and
if gamma affects disease pathology. Accordingly, we recorded neural activity from
behaving 5XFAD mice, a well-established model of Alzheimer's
disease. 10 In 3-month-old
mice, which have elevated levels of A β but no major plaque
accumulation in the hippocampus or manifestation of learning and memory
deficits, 10 we recorded
neural activity from hippocampal subregion CA1, where gamma has been particularly
well characterized (e.g. 11 – 14 ), using a virtual environment
( Ext. Data Fig. 1a ). In CA1, gamma is
present during distinct periods of activity: running, when theta oscillations (4-12
Hz) occur ( Ext. Data Fig. 1b , left ), and quiescent behavior, when sharp-wave ripples (SWR)
occur 15 , 16 ( Ext. Data
Fig. 1b , right ). We found no clear differences in slow
gamma power (20 to 50 Hz) between 5XFAD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates during
theta ( Ext. Data Fig. 1c, d ).

We next examined gamma during SWRs, high frequency oscillations of 150-250 Hz
lasting around 50-100 ms ( Ext. Data Fig. 1b,
e ). 14 Prior work
has shown that slow gamma is elevated during SWRs and increased gamma synchrony
across CA3 and CA1 during SWR correlates with more coordinated firing between
neurons. 16 Similarly, we
found increased gamma power during SWRs ( Fig.
1da yellow arrow indicates elevated gamma, Ext. Data Fig. 1e ). The instantaneous frequencies of these slower
oscillations (10-50 Hz, Methods) were a unimodal distribution centered around 40 Hz
( Fig. 1b , Ext. Data Fig. 1f ). Comparing gamma during SWRs in WT and 5XFAD
littermates, we found that gamma power was significantly lower in 5XFAD than in WT
mice (Methods, Fig. 1c , Ext. Data Fig. 1g, j ; examples in Fig. 1c , top ). Spiking was phase
modulated by gamma in both groups, although the depth of modulation was
significantly smaller in 5XFAD than in WT animals ( Fig. 1d , Ext. Data Fig. 1h, k ).
Furthermore, there were fewer SWRs per time in non-theta periods in 5XFAD mice
compared to WT ( Ext. Data Fig. 1i ), reducing
periods when gamma power is elevated ( Fig.
1a,c , Ext. Data Fig. 1e ). These
results reveal deficits in gamma modulation of CA1 spiking in a mouse model of AD
prior to the development of major amyloid plaque accumulation or evidence of
cognitive impairment. This deficit in gamma converges with evidence of gamma
deficits in different mouse models of AD, and reports that gamma is altered in
humans with AD. 5 , 8 , 9 Indeed, molecular deficits in Nav1.1 in humans have been linked with gamma deficits
in hAPP mice. 7

## Gamma stimulation reduced Aβproduction in hippocampal
CA1
These gamma deficits during SWRs early in disease progression in this mouse
model of AD prompt the question of whether gamma could affect molecular and cellular
AD pathophysiology. To test this, we induced gamma optogenetically in 5XFAD/PV-Cre
mice (Methods, Fig. 1e , left , Ext. Data Fig. 2a, b, c ). We chose to drive
FS-PV-interneurons at 40 Hz because we found deficits in gamma during SWRs, and
instantaneous gamma frequencies during SWRs were centered around 40 Hz. Delivering 1
ms 473 nm light pulses at 40 Hz resulted in increased power at 40 Hz in LFPs in CA1,
while random stimulation did not ( Fig. 1e , Ext. Data Fig. 1l ). Both resulted in
similar firing rates ( Ext. Data Fig. 1m, n,
o ).

A β accumulation is thought to initiate multiple
neurotoxic events typical for AD pathology. Therefore, we examined whether gamma
stimulation affected overall A β peptide levels in the
hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. We found that 1 hr of FS-PV-interneuron stimulation
reduced A β 1-40 by 53.22% and A β 1-42 by 44.62% in the 40 Hz group
which expresses ChR2 compared to the EYFP control group, as measured in CA1 by A β enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ( Fig. 1f, g , raw concentration (pg/ml) in Ext. Data Table 1 ). We performed a
comprehensive set of control experiments to determine whether the effect was
specific to frequency, cell type, and/or rhythmicity. Neither stimulation of
CamKII-positive excitatory neurons at 40 Hz, nor FS-PV-interneurons at 8 Hz or
random intervals significantly reduced A β levels ( Fig. 1f-i , Methods). Immunohistochemical
analysis using two β -amyloid-specific antibodies (Cell
Signaling Technology; D54D2, BioLegend; 12F4 17 ) in CA1 confirmed these
results: A β labeling intensity was significantly reduced
by 39.5% following 40 Hz stimulation compared to EYFP controls ( Fig. 2e, f , D54D2 antibody, Ext. Data Fig. 2e, f , 12F4 antibody).

Brain amyloid concentration depends on A β production from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and A β clearance rates. To elucidate how 40 Hz stimulation reduced A β production, we examined its effects on APP cleavage
by measuring levels of the cleavage intermediates of APP, C-terminal fragments
(CTFs) and N-terminal fragments (NTFs), in the hippocampus of the 5XFAD/PV-Cre mice.
Following 40 Hz stimulation, we found significantly reduced APP CTFs and NTFs
compared to EYFP and random controls ( Fig. 2a, b, c,
d , Ext. Data Fig. 2d ).

Prior work has shown that APP is transported and processed in recycling
endosomes 18 , and enlarged
early endosomes have been observed in brain tissue from AD patients 19 . Therefore, we characterized
endosomes in CA1 following stimulation using two markers, EEA1 (early endosomal
antigen 1) and Rab5 (Ras-related protein encoded by the RAB5A gene). Altogether, the intensity of endosomal labeling of CA1 neurons significantly
decreased in both EEA1 (39.7%) and Rab5 (40.1%) following 40Hz
stimulation compared to EYFP controls ( Fig. 2e,
g , Ext. Data Fig. 2g, h ). These
results suggest that in addition to observed changes in APP cleavage products, 40 Hz
stimulation also alters general endosomal processing.

## Gamma stimulation induced morphological transformation of microglia
To further explore the cellular and molecular effects of stimulation in an
unbiased manner, we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of CA1 tissue
following 1 hr of 40 Hz or no stimulation (EYFP) of the 5XFAD/PV-Cre mice ( Fig. 3a , Ext. Data
Fig. 3a, b, c ). Interestingly, 35% of all up-regulated genes had
their highest expression in microglia ( Fig.
3b ). This RNA-seq analysis strongly suggests that 40 Hz stimulation causes an
alteration in the state of microglia, which is significant given the accumulating
evidence that microglia play a role in AD pathology. 20 Transcriptomic changes following 40 Hz
stimulation were positively correlated with changes due to increased neural activity
(by NMDA and bicuculline), and negatively correlated with changes due to silencing
activity (by tetrodotoxin) ( Ext. Data Fig. 3d ).
The immediate early genes Nr4a1, Arc , and Npas4 ,
which are up-regulated by neuronal activity, were elevated as shown by both RNA-seq
and RT-qPCR ( Ext. Data Fig. 3e ).

These transcriptomic results also suggest an engulfing state of microglia.
The up-regulated genes were positively correlated with genomic changes induced by
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) and granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), known to promote microglial A β uptake ( Ext. Data Fig.
3d ). 21 RT-qPCR
confirmed that up-regulated genes included microglial engulfment associated genes Cd68 , B2m, Bst2, Icam1 , and Lyz2 ( Fig. 3c ).
Microglia-enriched transcriptional regulator Irf7 , cell adhesion
and migration regulator Spp1 , and microglia proliferation markers Csf1r and Csf2ra were also up-regulated ( Fig. 3c ). Importantly, RT-qPCR showed that the
expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes Il6 , Il1b ( Il1-β) , Itgam ( CD11-b) and an anti-inflammatory gene Igf1 were not changed ( Fig. 3c ).

Given that 40 Hz stimulation up-regulated both phagocytosis- and
migration/cell adhesion-related genes, we examined morphological features of
microglia activation. We used an antibody against microglial marker Iba1 to label
microglia in CA1 sections from 5XFAD/PV-Cre mice after 1 hr of 40 Hz or random
stimulation, or in mice expressing only EYFP (EYFP, Fig. 3d ). We observed almost twice as many microglia in the 40 Hz group
compared to EYFP and random control groups ( Fig. 3d,
e ). Furthermore, microglia cell body diameter increased by 135.3%
following 40 Hz stimulation compared to EYFP controls and by 138.7% compared
to random stimulation ( Fig. 3d, f ). The length
of microglia primary processes were reduced by 54.0% in the 40 Hz
stimulation condition compared to EYFP controls and by 38.5%compared to
random stimulation ( Fig. 3d, g ). Iba1 levels
did not affect these findings as gene expression analysis showed that Iba1
expression did not differ between conditions ( Ext.
Data Fig. 3a, b ). The increase in cell body size and decrease in process
length observed after 40 Hz stimulation are consistent with a shift towards a
phagocytic state of microglia. 22 To
evaluate microglia A β uptake specifically, we measured
co-localization of A β within microglia by
co-immunostaining with an A β antibody (12F4, Methods). The
percent of microglia co-localized with A β in the cell body
increased to 85.6% following 40 Hz stimulation from 31.7% (EYFP
control, Fig. 3d,h ). 3D renderings of
microglia further demonstrate the presence of A β within
microglia ( Ext. Data Vid.
1 , 2 , 3 ). We did not find evidence
of neuronal loss by measuring the CA1 cellular layer thickness ( Ext. Data Fig. 3f, g ). Together, these results suggest
that gamma stimulation triggers microglia to increase A β uptake.

## Visual stimulation by light flicker drives gamma non-invasively in primary visual
cortex
Many studies have shown that visual stimulation can drive oscillations in
the gamma range. 2 , 23 In particular, flickering lights at a
specific frequency can induce that frequency in primary visual cortex
(VC). 24 To determine if
light flickering could entrain 40 Hz oscillations and subsequently alter A β , we exposed 5XFAD mice to 40 Hz flickering for 1 hr,
analogous to optogenetic stimulation that reduced A β described above ( Fig. 4a , Ext. Data Vid. 4 ). In VC, we found that
light flickering at 40 Hz increased power in the LFP at 40 Hz, while random interval
flickering (random flicker) and dark exposure did not ( Fig. 4a , Ext. Data Fig.
4a ). All induced similar firing rates ( Ext.
Data Fig. 4b, c ). Spiking increased and decreased concomitantly as the
light flickered on and off, resulting in spiking entrained to 40 Hz during 40 Hz
flicker but not during random flicker ( Fig.
4b ). Recordings from saline above the brain exhibited no change in 40 Hz
power during 40 Hz flicker, showing that this effect was not due to photoelectric
effects or electrical noise ( Ext. Data Fig. 4d,
e ).

## Visual stimulation by light flicker decreases Aβlevels
in primary visual cortex
Given that 40 Hz light flicker entrains 40 Hz oscillations in VC, we aimed
to determine whether 40 Hz flicker could reduce A β levels.
3-month-old 5XFAD mice were placed in a dark box and exposed to either light flicker
at different frequencies (20, 40, or 80 Hz), random flicker, constant light on
(light), or dark for 1 hr. One hour after 1 hr of 40 Hz flicker, we observed that A β 1-40 levels in VC were reduced by
57.96% and A β 1-42 levels by
57.97% compared to dark controls (as measured by A β ELISA, Fig.
4c ). The effect was specific to 40 Hz flicker as neither constant light nor
20 Hz, 80 Hz, or random flicker significantly reduced A β levels compared to dark and light controls ( Fig.
4c ). We also found no change in A β levels in
somatosensory barrel cortex and hippocampus following 40 Hz flicker ( Ext. Data Fig. 5a-h ). When we pretreated 5XFAD mice with a
low dose GABA-A antagonist (picrotoxin, 0.18 mg/kg 25 ), the effects of 40 Hz flicker on A β levels were completely abrogated, indicating that
GABAergic neurotransmission is necessary for this effect ( Fig. 4c ). To demonstrate that these effects extend beyond
the 5XFAD mouse, we examined the effect of 40 Hz flicker in APP/PS1 mice, another
well-validated AD model, 26 and
found significantly reduced A β 1-40 , by
20.80%, and a non-significant trend of reduced
A β 1-42 by 37.68%( Ext. Data Fig. 6a ). Furthermore, in 9-month-old WT mice,
we found a 58.2% reduction in endogenous mouse A β 1-40 following 1 hr of 40 Hz flicker ( Ext. Data Fig. 6b ). The reduction of endogenous
mouse A β 1-40 in WT animals reveals that these
effects are not restricted to transgenic APP expression or mutant APP; rather, they
extend to A β produced from endogenous APP driven by its
endogenous promoter.

Next, we investigated whether 40 Hz flicker alters microglia activity in VC
in a similar manner that 40 Hz optogenetic stimulation altered CA1 microglia. While
microglia number was unchanged ( Fig. 4d, e ),
microglia cell body diameter increased by 165.8% following 40 Hz flicker
compared to dark controls ( Fig. 4d, f ).
Microglia primary process lengths were reduced by 37.7% after 40 Hz flicker
compared to dark controls ( Fig. 4d, g ).
Consistent with this morphology, which indicates enhanced engulfment
activity, 22 A β /Iba1 co-localization in the cell body was increased
to 90.8%after 40 Hz flicker from 57.3% in the dark condition,
indicating more A β -bearing microglia ( Fig. 4d, h , p<0.01). To better resolve the
morphological change in microglia, we used CLARITY 27 to create 3D renderings of microglia from
100 μ m sections of VC, ( Ext. Data Vid. 5 , 6 ). To demonstrate that microglia
indeed engulf A β in the 5XFAD mouse, we purified microglia
from 5XFAD and WT animals using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, Methods)
and analyzed A β levels via ELISA. We found that
microglia-specific levels of A β are significantly higher
in 5XFAD animals than in WT controls ( Ext. Data Fig.
7a, b ). Synaptophysin levels did not change between dark and 40 Hz
flicker conditions, indicating that microglia activation likely did not affect
synapse number ( Ext. Data Fig. 7c, d , n.s.
= not significant, n=4 mice). Thus, 40 Hz oscillations induced
non-invasively via sensory entrainment reduced A β abundance and promoted microglia/A β interactions.

## Chronic visual stimulation by light flicker decreases plaque load in VC
We next assessed whether 40 Hz flicker was effective to treat animals that
have amyloid plaques. Because the effects of 40 Hz flicker on soluble A β levels were transient ( Ext. Data Fig. 8a ), we hypothesized that we would need repeated exposure
to affect insoluble A β . Thus, we treated 6-month-old 5XFAD
mice, which have amyloid plaque pathology in many brain regions including
VC, 10 for 1 hr daily over
7 days with 40 Hz flicker or dark, and analyzed VC tissue 24 hr later. We found that
7 days of 1 hr 40 Hz flicker reduced both soluble A β 1-40 and A β 1-42 levels, by 60.5% and
51.7% respectively, ( Fig. 4i, j ) and
insoluble A β 1-40 and A β 1-42 levels by 43.7% and
57.9% respectively ( Fig. 4i, j ).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 40 Hz flicker significantly reduced plaque
number in VC by 67.2% compared to dark controls ( Fig. 4k, l ) and plaque size by 63.7% ( Fig. 4k, m ). Taken together, these experiments
identify a non-invasive treatment with a profound effect on amyloid plaque
pathology. We next determined if 40 Hz flicker reduced tau phosphorylation, another
AD-related pathology. Using the TauP301S tauopathy mouse model 28 we found that 7 days of 1 hr 40 Hz visual
flicker treatment reduced phosphorylated tau serine202 and
serine404/threonine403/serine400 levels in VC by 41.2% and 42.3%,
respectively, and triggered microglia responses similar to those observed in 5XFAD
mice ( Ext. Data Fig. 9a-k ).

## Discussion
Gamma oscillations are thought to be important for higher cognitive
functions and sensory responses. 2 , 12 , 23 Here, we demonstrated that entraining oscillations and
spiking at 40 Hz, using optogenetics in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice and using a
non-invasive light flicker treatment to affect primary visual cortex in multiple
mouse models, resulted in a marked reduction of A β peptides. We also found a concomitant microglia response following 40 Hz
entrainment.

The robust reduction of total amyloid levels was likely mediated by both
decreased amyloidogenesis and increased amyloid endocytosis by microglia. Thus, it
appears that driving 40 Hz gamma oscillations may induce an overall neuroprotective
response that recruits both neurons and microglia. The fact that GABA-A antagonist
treatment completely abrogated the effects of 40 Hz stimulation on A β levels strongly suggests that GABAergic
neurotransmission is critical for these effects.

40 Hz flicker stimulation reduced A β in multiple
mouse models, including 5XFAD, APP/PS1, and WT mice. This replication in multiple
mouse models shows that these findings are not specific to one animal model and,
importantly, extend to situations where A β is produced
from APP expressed by its physiological promoter as it is in WT animals. In
addition, we found that 40 Hz oscillations reduced phosphorylated tau in a mouse
model of tauopathy, TauP301S, showing that the protective effects of gamma
stimulation generalize to other pathogenic proteins. In summary, these findings
uncover previously unknown cellular and molecular processes mediated by gamma
oscillations and establish a functional connection between brain gamma rhythms,
microglia function, and AD-related pathology.

These observations indicate that entraining gamma oscillations may provide a
broad spectrum of systemic effects in the brain, including in non-neuronal cells, to
attenuate Alzheimer's-related pathology. Because this approach is
fundamentally different from prior AD therapies, 29 further study is needed to determine whether this approach
will be therapeutic in human AD.

## Methods
All animal work was approved by the Committee for Animal Care of the
Division of Comparative Medicine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Adult (3-month-old) male double transgenic 5XFAD Cre mice were produced by
crossing 5XFAD transgenic mice with the transgenic PV or CW2 promoter driven Cre
line. Adult (5-month-old) male and female APP/PS1 mice were gifted from the
Tonegawa Laboratory. Adult (4-month-old) male TauP301S mice were obtained from
the Jackson Laboratory. 9-month-old WT mice (C57Bl/6) were obtained from the
Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed in groups of 3-5 on a standard 12 hr light
/ 12 hr dark cycle, and all experiments were performed during the light cycle.
Food and water were provided ad libitum unless otherwise noted.
Littermates were randomly assigned to each condition by the experimenter.
Experimenter was blind to animal genotypes during tissue processing and
electrophysiological recording and analysis. No animals were excluded from
analysis.

Adeno-associated viral particles of serotype 5 were obtained from the
Vector Core Facility at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
AAV5 virus contained a channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused to enhanced yellow
fluorescent protein (EYFP) in a double-floxed, inverted, open-reading-frame
(DIO) driven by the EF1 α promoter ( Ext. Data Fig. 2a ). An AAV-DIO-EYFP construct was used
as a control.

3-month-old 5XFAD/PV-Cre or CW2 mice were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of ketamine (1.1 mg
kg -1 ) and xylazine (0.16 mg kg -1 ). A small craniotomy
was made 2.0 mm posterior to bregma and 1.8 mm lateral to the midline on the
left side. Virus was delivered through a small durotomy by a glass micropipette
attached to a Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting). The glass
micropipette was lowered to 1.2 mm below the brain surface. A bolus of 1 μ L of virus (AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP or AAV-DIO-EYFP; 2
× 10 12 viral molecules per ml) was injected into the CA1
region of hippocampus at 0.075 μ L min -1 .
The pipette remained in place for 5 min following the injection before being
retracted from the brain. A unilateral optical fiber implant (300 μ m core diameter; Thor Labs) was lowered to 0.9 mm
below the brain surface about the injection site. Two small screws anchored at
the anterior and posterior edges of the surgical site were bound with dental
glue to secure the implant in place.

For electrophysiological recordings adult (3-month-old) male
5XFAD/PV-Cre and 5XFAD negative littermates (for CA1 recordings), or 5XFAD and
their wild type littermates (for VC recordings) mice were anesthetized using
isoflurane and placed in a stereotactic frame. The scalp was shaved, ophthalmic
ointment (Puralube Vet Ointment, Dechra) was applied to the eyes, and Betadine
and 70% ethanol were used to sterilize the surgical area. For CA1
recordings, a craniotomy (in mm, from bregma: -2 A/P, 1.8 M/L) was opened to
deliver 1 μ L of virus to CA1 (as described above). The
target craniotomy site for LFP recordings was marked on the skull (in mm, from
bregma: -3.23 A/P, 0.98 M/L for CA1 and 2.8 A/P, 2.5 M/L for VC), three
self-tapping screws (F000CE094, Morris Precision Screws and Parts) were attached
to the skull, and a custom stainless steel headplate was affixed using dental
cement (C&B Metabond, Parkell). On the day of the first recording
session, a dental drill was used to open the LFP craniotomies (300-400 μ m diameter) by first thinning the skull until
∼100 μ m thick, and then using a 30 gauge
needle to make a small aperture. The craniotomy was then sealed with a sterile
silicone elastomer (Kwik-Sil WPI) until recording that day and in between
recording sessions.

Two to four weeks following virus injection and implant placement (which
provides time for the mice to recover and undergo behavior training for animals
used for electrophysiology) and the virus to express in the neurons, CA1 neurons
were optogenetically manipulated. A 200 mW 4793 nm DPSS laser was connected to a
patch cord with a fiber channel/physical contact connector at each end. During
the experiment, 1 mW (measured from the end of the fiber) of optical stimulation
was delivered for 1 hr. For molecular and biochemical analyses, each animal
received one of three stimulation protocols: 8 Hz, 40 Hz, or random stimulation
(light pulses were delivered with a random interval determined by a Poisson
process with an average frequency of 40 Hz). EYFP control animals received 40 Hz
stimulation. For electrophysiological recordings each animal received all
stimulation conditions interleaved during recordings.

15 minutes prior to the experiment 5XFAD mice were treated with saline
(Control) or picrotoxin (0.18 mg/kg). 25 For molecular and biochemical analyses mice were then
placed in a dark chamber illuminated by a light emitting diode (LED) bulb and
exposed to one of five stimulation conditions: dark, light, 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 80 Hz
flicker (12.5 ms light on, 12.5 ms light off, 60 W) for 1h. For
electrophysiological recordings each animal received dark, light, 40 Hz flicker,
or random (light pulses were delivered with a random interval determined by a
Poisson process with an average interval of 40 Hz) stimulation conditions
interleaved in 10 s blocks during recordings.

For CA1 recordings, headfixed animals ran on an 8” spherical
treadmill supported by an air cushion through a virtual reality environment, as
described in Harvey et al. 30 The motion of the spherical treadmill was measured by an optical mouse and fed
into virtual reality software 31 , running in MATLAB (version 2013b, Mathworks). The virtual
environment consisted of a linear track with two small enclosures at the ends
where the animal could turn ( Ext. Data Fig.
1a ). Animals were rewarded with sweetened condensed milk (diluted 1:2
in water) at each end of the track for alternating visits to each end of the
track.

Animals learned to run on the virtual linear track over approximately
one week. The animals were left to recover from the surgery for one week, and
habituated to handling for one to two days before behavioral training began. To
learn to maneuver on the treadmill and get comfortable in the testing
environment, on the first two days of training the animals were placed on the
spherical treadmill with the virtual reality system off and were rewarded with
undiluted sweetened condensed milk. On the second day of training on the
spherical treadmill, animals' food was restricted to motivate them to
run. Animals were restricted to no more than 85% of their baseline
weight and typically weighed over 88% of their baseline weight. From the
third day until the end of training (typically 5-7 days) the animals were placed
on the treadmill for increasing amounts of time (30 min to 2 hr) running in the
VR linear track. Animals were rewarded with diluted (1:2) sweetened condensed
milk at the end of the linear track after traversing the length of the track.
Between recording sessions, animals were given refresher training sessions to
maintain behavioral performance.

For VC recordings, animals ran on the spherical treadmill while exposed
to dark, light, or light flickering conditions (described below in data
acquisition). Prior to recordings animals learned to maneuver on the treadmill
and get comfortable in the testing environment by being placed on the spherical
treadmill (with the virtual reality system off) and receiving reward of
undiluted sweetened condensed milk.

For optogenetic stimulation of CA1 during recording, a 300 μ m core optical fiber was advanced through the
craniotomy used to deliver virus to CA1 to a depth of 900 μ m into the brain. Light pulses that were 1 ms and
1 mW (measured from the end of the fiber) were delivered via a 473 nm DPSS
(diode pumped solid state) laser (as described above).

To avoid photoelectric artifacts, neural activity was recorded with
glass electrodes. LFP electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass pipettes
(Warner) on a filament-based micropipette puller (Flaming-Brown P97, Sutter
Instruments), to a fine tip, which was then manually broken back to a diameter
of ∼10-20 μ m and then filled with sterile
saline. For CA1 recordings the LFP electrode was advanced through the LFP
recording craniotomy at an angle 60 degrees posterior to the coronal plane and
45 degrees inferior to the horizontal plane until clear electrophysiological
signatures of the hippocampal stratum pyramidale layer were
observed (∼600-1000 μ V theta waves while the
animal was running, clearly distinguishable sharp-wave ripples during
immobility, and multiple spikes greater than 150 μ V, Ext. Data Fig. 1b ). For VC recordings
the LFP electrode was advanced vertically through the LFP recording craniotomy
to a depth of 600-900 μ m and multiple spikes greater
than 150 μ V were observed.

Data was acquired with a sampling rate of 20 kHz and bandpass filtered 1
Hz-1 kHz. Animals ran on the spherical treadmill or rested for prolonged
periods. For optogenetic simulation sessions, data was recorded for 30 minutes
before any stimulation began. Then stimulation was delivered at gamma (40 Hz),
random (as described under optogenetic stimulation protocol ),
or theta (8 Hz) frequency for 10 s periods interleaved with 10 s baseline
periods (no stimulation). In two animals, stimulation of each type or baseline
was delivered for 5 min periods instead of 10 s periods. Each 30 minutes of
stimulation recordings were followed by 5-30 minutes of recording with no
stimulation. For visual light flicker simulation sessions, LED strip lights
surrounding the animal lights were flickered at gamma (40 Hz), random (described
above in Visual stimulation protocol ), theta (8 Hz), or 20 Hz
frequency for 10 s periods, or were on continuously for 10 s periods,
interleaved with 10 s periods with lights off. A few recordings were made above
the brain surface during light flicker to ensure that the lights did not create
electrical or photoelectric noise during recording. Recording sessions were
terminated after approximately 3-5 hr. Animals were 3-4 months old at the time
of recording.

Spikes were detected by thresholding the 300-6000 Hz bandpassed
signal. Threshold was the median of the filtered signal plus five times a
robust estimator of the standard deviation of the filtered signal
(median/0.675) to avoid contamination of the standard deviation measure by
spikes. (Rossant 2015: http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/02/16/015198.full.pdf )

Recorded traces were downsampled to 2 kHz and then bandpass filtered
between 1 to 300 Hz.

Activity across the hippocampal network changes markedly when
animals run or sit quietly and these changes are often referred to as
different network states. These network states are clearly distinguishable
by the presence or absence of LFP oscillations in different frequency
bands 12 , 13 . When animals ran, we observed large
theta (4-12 Hz) oscillations in CA1 as others have shown ( Ext. Data Fig. 1b, left ) 13 , 30 , 32 , 33 . When animals sat quietly, theta
oscillations were no longer visible and we recorded sharp wave ripples
(SWRs), high frequency oscillations of 150-250 Hz that last around 50-100 ms
and are associated with bursts of population activity, as others have
observed ( Ext. Data Fig. 1b , right ) 15 , 16 .

SWRs were detected ( Fig. 1a, b, c,
d , Ext. Data Fig. 1d, e, f, g, h,
i ) when the envelope amplitude of the filtered trace was greater
than four standard deviations above the mean for at least 15 ms. The
envelope amplitude was calculated by taking the absolute value of the
Hilbert transform of the filtered LFP. We also confirmed our results held
when using a higher threshold for SWR detection, 6 standard deviations above
the mean, which detects larger SWRs ( Ext. Data
Fig 1j, k ). To detect theta ( Ext.
Data Fig. 1c,d ), the LFP was bandpass filtered for theta (4-12
Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz) using an FIR equiripple filter. The
ratio of theta to delta and beta (“theta ratio”) was
computed as the theta envelope amplitude divided by the sum of the delta and
beta envelope amplitudes. Theta periods were classified as such when the
theta ratio was greater than one standard deviation above mean for at least
two seconds and the ratio reached a peak of at least two standard deviations
above mean. Non-theta periods were classified as such when the theta ratio
was less than one for at least two seconds. Sharp wave ripples, theta
periods, and non-theta periods were visually inspected to ensure that these
criteria accurately detected sharp wave ripple, theta periods, and non-theta
periods, respectively.

Spectral analysis was performing using multitaper methods (Chronux
toolbox, time-bandwidth product = 3, number of tapers = 5).
For examining power spectra without stimulation ( Ext. Data Fig. 1c, d ), only theta periods were
included: theta periods greater than 5 s long were divided into 5 s trials
and the average power spectral density was computed for each animal over
these trials. For examining power spectra during optogenetic ( Fig. 1e , Ext. Data Fig. 1l ) and visual stimulation ( Fig. 4a , Ext. Data
Fig. 4a ), data was divided into 10 s trials of each stimulation
condition or baseline periods, and the average power spectral density was
computed for each animal over these trials.

Spectrograms were computed using multitaper methods (Chronux
toolbox). The spectrogram was computed for each SWR including a window of
400 ms before and after the peak of the SWR. Then a z-scored spectrogram was
computed in each frequency band using the mean and standard deviation of the
spectrogram computed across the entire recording session to create a
normalized measure of power in units of standard deviation ( Fig. 1a , Ext. Data
Fig. 1e ). Instantaneous frequency of gamma during SWRs was
computed by bandpass filtering the LFP for 10-50 Hz, taking the Hilbert
transform, then taking the reciprocal of the difference in peaks of the
transformed signal ( Fig. 1b , Ext. Data Fig. 1f ). Gamma power before,
during, and after SWRs was computed by filtering the LFP for low gamma
(20-50 Hz) and taking the amplitude of the envelope of the Hilbert transform
to get the mean gamma power in 100 ms bins centered on the SWR peak. This
was normalized by the mean and standard deviation of the amplitude of the
envelope for the entire recording session to get z-scored gamma power for
each bin around each SWR ( Fig. 1c , Ext. Data Fig. 1g, j ). Phase
modulation by gamma during SWRs was computed by bandpass filtering the LFP
for gamma (20-50 Hz), taking the Hilbert transform, and determining the
phase of the resulting signal for each spike that occurred during SWRs
( Ext. Data Fig. 1h ). To measure
differences in phase modulation between 5XFAD and WT animals, we used
resampling with replacement: a subset of 100 spikes from each recording was
randomly selected to create a phase modulation distribution and this was
repeated 500 times for each recording ( Fig.
1d , Ext. Data Fig. 1k ). We
then measured the depth of modulation for the spike-gamma phase distribution
by computing the difference between the peak and trough divided by the sum
of the peak and trough for each distribution ( Fig. 1d , Ext. Data Fig.
1k ).

To plot stimulus-evoked multiunit firing histograms, spikes were
binned in 2.5 ms bins for 100 ms after the start of each light on pulse and
the fraction of spikes in each bin was computed. Mean and standard error was
then computed across all light-on periods. To compute differences in
multi-unit firing rate between conditions, firing rates were computed for
each 10 s period of stimulation or baseline (total number of spikes divided
by duration of period). Differences in firing rate were taken between nearby
periods of the relevant type of stimulation (firing rate in gamma
stimulation period minus baseline or random periods for optogenetic
stimulation, firing rate in gamma stimulation period minus baseline,
continuous on, or random periods for light flicker stimulation). Differences
from all animals were plotted in histograms ( Ext. Data Fig. 1m , 4c ) and
the median and quartiles of the multiunit firing rates per 40 Hz
stimulation, random stimulation, and no stimulation period for each animal
were plotted in box plots ( Ext. Data Fig.
1o , 4d ).

Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde under deep
anesthesia, and the brains were post-fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains were sectioned at 40 μ m
using a vibratome (Leica). Sections were permeabilized and blocked in PBS
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum at
room temperature for 1 hr. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C
in primary antibody in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10%
normal donkey serum. Primary antibodies were anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction
Laboratories; 641057), anti- β -amyloid (Cell
Signaling Technology; D54D2), anti-Iba1 (Wako Chemicals; 019-19741),
anti-parvalbumin (Abcam; ab32895), anti-Rab5 (Enzo Life Sciences;
ADI-KAP-GP006-E). To confirm ELISA experiments, the anti-A β antibody D54D2 was used because it allowed
for co-labeling with EEA1 and the anti A β antibody
12F4 was used because it does not react with APP allowing us to determine if
our labeling was specific to A β . For co-labeling
experiments, the anti-A β antibody 12F4 (Biolegend;
805501) was used. Primary antibodies were visualized with Alexa-Fluor 488
and Alex-Fluor 647 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), and cell nuclei
visualized with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich; 94403). Images were acquired
using a confocal microscope (LSM 710; Zeiss) with a 40X objective at
identical settings for all conditions. Images were quantified using ImageJ
1.42q by an experimenter blind to treatment groups. For each experimental
condition, 2 coronal sections from at least 3 animals were used for
quantification. Scale bars are 50 μ m. For CA1
imaging, the analysis was restricted to the pyramidal cell layer, except in
the case of Iba1+ cells analysis, where the whole field of view was
required to image an adequate number of cells. ImageJ was used to measure
the diameter of Iba1+ cell bodies and to trace the processes for
length measurement. In addition, the Coloc2 plugin was used to measure
co-localization of Iba1 and A β . Imarisx64 8.1.2
(Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for 3D rendering. For counting the
“plaque number,” deposits ≥10 μ m were included.

Fixed brains were sliced into 100uM coronal sections on a vibratome
(Leica VT100S) in 1XPBS. Sections containing VC were selected, with
reference to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, and incubated in clearing buffer
(pH 8.5-9.0, 200mM sodium dodecylsulfate, 20mM lithium hydroxide
monohydrate, 4mM boric acid in ddH 2 O) for 2 hours, shaking at
55°C. Cleared sections were washed 3 ×10mins in 1XPBST
(0.1% Triton-X100/1XPBS) and put into blocking solution (2%
bovine serum albumin/1XPBST) overnight, shaking at RT. 27 Subsequently, three 1hour washes in
1X PBST were performed, shaking at RT. Sections were then incubated at
4°C for 2 days, shaking, with
anti- β -amyloid (Biolegend;805501) and anti-Iba1
(Wako Chemicals; 019-19741) primary antibodies, diluted to 1:100 in 1X PBST.
Another set of 3×1 h washes in 1XPBST was conducted before sections
were incubated for 9 hours, shaking at RT, in 1:100 1X PBS diluted secondary
antibody mixture. Fragmented Donkey Anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488
(Abcam; ab175694) and Anti-Mouse 568 (Abcam; ab150101) secondary antibodies
were used to visualize the primary antibody labeling. Halfway through this
incubation period, Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich; 94403) was spiked into each
sample at a 1:250 final dilution. Sections were then washed overnight in
1×PBS, shaking at RT. Prior to mounting for imaging, slices were
incubated in RIMS (Refractive Index Matching Solution: 75g Histodenz, 20mL
0.1M phosphate buffer, 60mL ddH 2 O) for 1 hour, shaking at RT.
Tissue sections were mounted onto microscopy slides with coverslips (VWR
VistaVision, VWR International, LLC, Radnor, PA) using Fluromount G Mounting
Medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Images were
acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope with the accompanying Zen Black 2.1
software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany). Section overview and
cellular level images used for 3D reconstruction were taken using a
Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC objective. Imaris×64 8.1.2
(Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for 3D rendering and analysis.

CA1 whole cell lysates were prepared using tissue from 3-month-old
male 5XFAD/PV-Cre mice. Tissue was homogenized in 1 ml RIPA (50 mM Tris HCl
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS) buffer with a hand homogenizer (Sigma), incubated on ice
for 15 min, and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell debris was isolated
and discarded by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Lysates were
quantitated using a nanodrop and 25 μg protein was loaded on a
10% acrylamide gels. Protein was transferred from acrylamide gels to
PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) at 100 V for 120 min. Membranes were blocked
using bovine serum albumin (5% w/v) diluted in TBS:Tween. Membranes
were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary
antibodies at room temperature for 90 minutes. Primary antibodies were
anti-APP (Invitrogen; PAD CT695), anti-APP (Sigma;A8967),
anti- β -actin (Abcam; ab9485). Secondary
antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-linked (GE Healthcare). Signal
intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.46a and normalized to values of β -actin. We examined tau protein solubility
using sequential protein extraction as described in Yoshiyama et al.,
2007. 28 We then
probed the detergent insoluble tau fraction using an antibody against Tau5
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; AHB0042).

CA1 or VC was isolated from male mice, lysed with PBS or 5M
Guanidine HCl, and subjected to A β measurement
with the use of mouse (for WT experiments) or human (for all other
experiments) A β 1-40 or
A β 1-42 ELISA kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. We lysed the tissue in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to extract the PBS soluble A β fraction. The soluble A β fraction likely contained monomeric and
oligomeric A β . Tissue was further treated with
guanidine HCl to extract the insoluble A β fraction. A β 1-42 was below detectable
levels for both flicker and control groups in WT VC and microglia-specific
samples.

Total RNA was extracted from CA1 isolates using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). Purified mRNA was used for RNA-seq library preparation using the
BIOO NEXTflex™ kit (BIOO# 5138-08) per the
manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total mRNA was subject
to a sequential workflow of poly-A purification, fragmentation,
1 st strand and 2 nd strand synthesis, DNA
end-adenylation, and adapter ligation. The libraries were enriched by 15
cycles of PCR reactions and cleaned with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads
(Beckman Coulter). The quality of the libraries was assessed using an
Advanced Analytical-fragment Analyzer. The bar-coded libraries were equally
mixed for sequencing in a single lane on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at
the MIT BioMicro Center. The raw fastq data of 50-bp single-end sequencing
reads were aligned to the mouse mm9 reference genome using TopHat2.0. The
mapped reads were processed by Cufflinks 2.2 with UCSC mm9 reference gene
annotation to estimate transcript abundances, and test for differential
expression. An average of 26,518,345 sequencing reads was obtained from 3
stimulated and 3 non-stimulated mice. Relative abundance of transcript was
measured by Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped
(FPKM). Gene differential expression test between treated and untreated
groups was performed using Cuffdiff module with an adjusted
p-value<0.05 for statistical significance (GEO accession:
GSE77471).

To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms from our RNA-seq
data, 14 of publicly available RNA-seq datasets 34 were processed for cell-type
specific analysis. Additionally, 60 publicly available neuron-, microglia-,
and macrophage- specific RNA-seq datasets under different chemical and
genetic perturbations 35 – 40 were downloaded and processed using TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline for gene set
enrichment (GSEA) statistical analysis. GSEA was used to determine whether a
defined gene set from our RNA-seq data is significantly enriched at either
direction of a ranked gene list from a particular perturbation study. Genes
detected in the public RNA-seq datasets were ranked by log2 values of fold
change (case versus control), from positive to negative values. A defined
gene set (in our case, up- or down-regulated genes upon gamma treatment) was
considered significantly correlated with a perturbation-induced
transcriptomic change (either up- or down-regulation), when both nominal
p-value and false discovery rate (FDR) q-value were less than 0.05. The sign
of the calculated normalized enrichment score (NES) indicates whether the
gene set is enriched at the top or the bottom of the ranked list. The
heatmap for differentially expressed genes was generated using a custom R
script, and z-score values across all libraries for each gene were
calculated based on the gene FPKM values. The box plots for cell-type
specificity analysis were also generated by R program, based on gene FPKM
values.

The CA1 subregion was isolated from hippocampus of 3-month-old male
5XFAD/PV-Cre mice. Tissue was rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80 °C, and RNA extracted using the RNeasy kit according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). RNA (3 μ g) was treated with DNase I (4 U, Worthington
Biochemical Corporation), purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit
(Zymo Research) according to manufacturers' instructions and eluted
with 14 μ L DEPC-treated water. For each sample, 1 μ g RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20 μ Lreaction volume containing random hexamer
mix and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (50 U, Invitrogen) at 50
°C for 1 hr. First strand cDNAs were diluted 1:10 and
1 μ L were used for RT-qPCR amplification in a
20 μ L reaction (SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix,
Bio-Rad) containing primers (0.2 μ M). Relative
changes in gene expression were assessed using the
2 -ΔΔCt method.

The primary visual cortex (V1 region) was rapidly dissected and
placed in ice cold Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco by
Life Technologies, Catalog number 14175-095). The tissue was then
enzymatically digested using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P)
(Miltenyi Biotec, Catalog number 130-092-628) according to the
manufacturer's protocol, with minor modifications. Specifically, the
tissue was enzymatically digested at 37 °C for 15 minutes instead of
35 minutes and the resulting cell suspension was passed through a 40 μ m cell strainer (Falcon Cell Strainers,
Sterile, Corning, Product #352340) instead of a MACS SmartStrainer,
70 μ m. The resulting cell suspension was then
stained using allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD11b mouse clone
M1/70.15.11.5 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-098-088) and phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated CD45 antibody (BD Pharmingen, 553081) according to the
manufacturer's (Miltenyi Biotec) recommendations.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was then used to purify CD11b and
CD45 positive microglial cells. The cells were sorted directly into 1XPBS
( Ext. Data Fig. 6a ).

For electrophysiological data that was not normally distributed,
results are presented as medians and quartiles unless otherwise noted.
Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests for equal medians were performed to
determine if distributions were significantly different, and Wilcoxon signed
rank tests were performed to determine if distributions were significantly
different from zero as these do not assume data is normally distributed.
Variability was similar between the groups that were statistically compared.
The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. No
statistical method was used to estimate sample size, but it is consistent
with previous publications.

Molecular and biochemical results are presented as mean
+SEM. Percentages stated in manuscript are group means. All
statistical analysis was performed using Prism GraphPad software. Normality
was determined using the D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus
normality test. Variability was similar between the groups that were
statistically compared. Comparison data for normally distributed data
consisting of two groups was analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t tests. Comparison of data for normally distributed
data consisting of three or more groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Comparison data for
non-normally distributed data was carried out using Mann Whitney tests. The
statistical test, exact P values, and sample size (n) for each experiment is
specified in the figure legend. For optogenetic ELISA data, two-sided
unpaired Student's t-tests were performed to compare mice from the
same litter that received different conditions. No statistical method was
used to estimate sample size, but is consistent with previous publications.
Molecular and biochemical analysis was performed using a minimum of three
biological replicates per condition.

periods per session in 6 5XFAD mice and 80, 68, 115, 95, 15, 159, 218
non-theta periods per session in 6 WT mice).

k) The cumulative distribution of gamma power during large SWRs
(detection threshold greater than 6 standard deviations above the mean,
Methods) shows significantly smaller increases in 5XFAD (green) than WT

(ranksum test, bootstrap resampling p < 10 -10 ,

distributions).

m) Power spectral density during 40 Hz stimulation (red, left),
random stimulation (blue, center), or no stimulation (black, right) of
FS-PV-interneurons in CA1 for each mouse (n=4 5XFAD mice with 169,
130, 240, 73 40 Hz, 143, 129, 150, 72 random, and 278, 380, 52, 215 no
stimulation periods per animal and n=3 WT mice with 65, 93, 91 40
Hz, 64, 93, 90 random, and 187, 276, 270 no stimulation periods per
animal).

n) Above : Example raw LFP trace (above) and the
trace filtered for spikes (300-6000 Hz, below), with spikes indicated with
red stars after optogenetic stimulation (blue vertical lines). Below : histogram of spikes per pulse after the onset of
the 1 ms laser pulse during 40 Hz stimulation (red), random stimulation
(blue), or no stimulation (black, n=345762 40 Hz, 301559 random
pulses, and 32350 randomly selected no stimulation times at least 500 ms
apart from 552 40 Hz, 543 random, and 1681 no stimulation periods in 4 5XFAD
and 3 WT mice).

o) Histogram of the difference in firing rates between 40 Hz
stimulation and random stimulation periods shows that both types of
stimulation elicit similar amounts of spiking activity (Wilcoxon signed rank
test for zero median, p>0.6, n=538 stimulation periods from
4 5XFAD and 3 WT mice, n.s. indicates not significant).

p) Multiunit firing rates per 40 Hz stimulation (red), random
stimulation (blue), and no stimulation (black) period for each animal. Box
and whisker plots show median (white lines in box) and quartiles (top and
bottom of box). In all animals firing rates between 40 Hz and random
stimulation were not significantly different, showing that the random
stimulation condition serves as a control for spiking activity (ranksum
tests for each animal, 3 WT and 4 5XFAD mice, p's>0.09,
n=87, 130, 8, 65, 93, 91, 73 40 Hz stimulation periods and 85, 129,
5, 64, 93, 90, 72 random stimulation periods per animal). We also examined
whether 40 Hz stimulation caused neuronal hyperactivity relative to no
stimulation, because according to a recent report, this could have negative
effects on neural circuit function. 26 In most animals the firing rates between 40 Hz or
random stimulation and no stimulation were not significantly different
(ranksum tests for each animal, 2 WT and 2 5XFAD, p's>0.25,
n=8, 93, 91, 73 40 Hz stimulation periods and 15, 277, 270, 215
baseline periods per animal) or the firing rates during 40 Hz or random
stimulation were lower than during no stimulation (ranksum tests for each
animal, 1 WT and 1 5XFAD, p's<10 -5 , which is
significant when corrected for performing multiple comparisons,
n=130, 65 40 Hz stimulation periods and 379, 187 baseline periods
per animal) indicating that 40 Hz stimulation did not cause neuronal
hyperactivity. In one animal there was significantly more activity with 40
Hz or random stimulation than during baseline (ranksum test for 1 5XFAD,
mouse, p<10 -5 , n=87 40 Hz stimulation periods and
251 baseline periods per animal). Therefore in six out of seven animals we
see no evidence that the 40 Hz optogenetic stimulation of FS-PV-interneurons
causes hyperactivity.

a) AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP or AAV-DIO-EYFP drives Cre-dependent expression
of ChR2-EYFP or EYFP to produce celltype-specific targeting of ChR2 or EYFP,
respectively. In the presence of Cre, ChR2-EYFP or EYFP is inverted into the

indicates p<0.001 by Student's t-test, n=3 mice per
group). All bar graphs show mean + SEM.

f) Immunohistochemistry with Hoechst to label all cell nuclei in CA1
of 5XFAD/PV-Cre mice expressing only EYFP or ChR2 with 40 Hz stimulation
conditions (scale bar = 50 μm).

a) Power spectral densities of local field potentials in VC during
40 Hz light flicker (red, far left), random light flicker (blue, center
left), dark (black, center right), or light (green, far right) in VC for
each recording session for each mouse (n=5 recordings from 4 5XFAD
mice with 47, 51, 64, 49, 16 40 Hz flicker, 47, 50, 64, 50, 16 random
flicker, 279, 301, 382, 294, 93 dark and 47, 50, 64, 49, 15 light periods).
Light flicker at other frequencies increased power in the flicker frequency,
as others have found previously 23 , 24 (data not
shown).

b) Histogram of the difference in firing rates between 40 Hz light
flicker and random light flicker (n=226 stimulation periods from 5
recording sessions in 4 5XFAD mice).

c) Multiunit firing rates in VC during 40 Hz light flicker (red),
random light flicker (blue), dark (black), or light (green) periods. Box
plots show median (white lines in box) and quartiles (top and bottom of
box). In all animals, firing rates between 40 Hz flicker and random flicker
conditions were not significantly different showing that the random
stimulation condition serves as a control for spiking activity (ranksum
tests for each of 5 recording session from 4 5XFAD mice,
p's>0.06, n=47, 51, 64, 49, 16 40 Hz flicker periods
and 47, 50, 64, 50, 16 random flicker periods per recording). There were no
significant differences in firing rates between 40 Hz flicker and light
conditions indicating that 40 Hz light flicker generally did not cause
neuronal hyperexcitability (ranksum tests for each of 5 recording session
from 4 5XFAD mice, p's > 0.2 for 4 recording sessions,
p<0.01 for 1 recording session, which is not significant when
corrected for performing multiple comparisons, n=47, 51, 64, 49, 16
40 Hz periods and 47, 50, 64, 49, 16 light periods per recording). In one
session, there was more activity in the 40 Hz flicker than in the dark
condition.

d) Example traces of LFPs recorded above the brain during light
flicker (above, yellow indicates light on, black indicates light off),
during three different recording sessions.

e) Power spectral densities of LFPs recorded above the brain during
40 Hz light flicker show no increase in power at 40 Hz. Thus, the effect is
not due to photoelectric effects on recording equipment or electrical noise
(n= 4, 2,1, 1, 17, 42, 36, 55, 53 40 Hz flicker periods from 4
recording sessions in 3 5XFAD mice undergoing VC recordings and from 5
recording sessions in 2 5XFAD and 3 WT mice undergoing hippocampal
recordings). Mean (solid line) and standard deviation (shaded area) across
recordings are shown on the left and per animal on the right. Recordings
with less than 3 flicker periods (light red) resulted in noisier power
spectral densities than recordings with more data (dark red) but none showed
evidence of peaks at 40 Hz.

a) Example local field potential trace in hippocampal CA1 before and
during 40 Hz light flicker (above). Mean (solid line) and standard deviation
(shaded area) of power spectral density during 40 Hz light flicker (red),
random light flicker (blue), or dark (black) in CA1 (n=2 5XFAD and 3
WT mice).

b) Histogram of the fraction of spikes in hippocampus as a function
of time for 4 cycles of 40 Hz light flicker (left, red) or the equivalent
period of time for random light flicker (right, blue, n=2 5XFAD and
3 WT mice, mean ± SEM across animals). Bar above indicates when
light was on (yellow) or off (black). For random stimulation, spiking was
aligned to the start of the light turning on, additional periods with
light-on occurred at random intervals indicated by grey (Methods).

c) Histogram of the difference in firing rates between 40 Hz light
flicker and random light flicker (bottom n=168 stimulation periods
from 5 recording sessions in 2 5XFAD and 3 WT mice).

d) Power spectral densities of local field potentials in CA1 during
40 Hz light flicker (red, far left), random light flicker (blue, center
left), dark (black, center right), or light (green, far right) for each
recording session for each mouse (n=5 recordings from 2 5XFAD and 3
WT mice with 22, 54, 42, 71, 55, 40 Hz flicker, 12, 34, 32, 54, 36 random
flicker, 115, 240, 224, 342, 282 dark and 12, 33, 33, 54, 35 light
periods).

e) Multiunit firing rates in CA1 during 40 Hz light flicker (red),
random light flicker (blue), dark (black), or light (green) periods. Box
plots show median (white lines in box) and quartiles (top and bottom of
box). In all animals firing rates between 40 Hz flicker and random flicker
conditions were not significantly different showing that the random
stimulation condition serves as a control for spiking activity (ranksum
tests for each of 5 recordings from 2 5XFAD and 3 WT animals,
p's>0.2, n=22, 54, 42, 71, 55 40 Hz flicker periods
and 12, 34, 32, 54, 36 random flicker periods per recording). There were no
significant differences in firing rates between 40 Hz flicker and light
conditions indicating that 40 Hz light flicker generally did not cause
neuronal hyperexcitability (ranksum tests for each of 5 recordings from 2
5XFAD and 3 WT animals, p's > 0.3, n=22, 54, 42, 71,
55 40 Hz periods and 12, 34, 33, 54, 35 light periods per recording).
