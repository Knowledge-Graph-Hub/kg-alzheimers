Deaths from Alzheimer’s Disease — United States, 1999–2014

## Discussion
Symptoms of early stage Alzheimer’s include memory loss that interferes with daily activities, difficulties with problem solving, losing or misplacing objects, and changes in mood and personality. As Alzheimer’s progresses, the brain’s ability to control language and reasoning becomes impaired. Persons might have problems recognizing family and friends or performing multistep tasks such as getting dressed. In advanced stages, persons with Alzheimer’s might be bedridden, have difficulty communicating, swallowing, or controlling bowel or bladder functions ( 2 ).

Adults aged ≥65 years are at greatest risk for developing Alzheimer’s ( 2 ). The number of Alzheimer’s deaths has increased, in part, because of a growing population of older adults. With the number of older adults increasing, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s is projected to quadruple by 2050 ( 3 ). However, age-adjusted rates of Alzheimer’s deaths have been increasing since 1979 ( 4 ). Although the actual number Alzheimer’s deaths might be increasing, the increase in the rate of Alzheimer’s deaths might also be attributed to increases in premorbid Alzheimer’s diagnosis by patients seeking care for symptoms and increased reporting by physicians, coroners, and medical examiners who assign causes of death.

Studies have shown that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are more likely to have Alzheimer’s because of a wide variety of factors including increased cardiovascular disease risk factors ( 5 ). In contrast, this analysis showed that non-Hispanic whites have higher rates of Alzheimer’s deaths. The causes of the racial differences in the increase in Alzheimer’s death rates might be the result of competing causes of mortality; when compared with non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks have higher rates for death from cardiovascular disease at younger ages ( 6 ).

It is important to note that the largest increase in the mortality rate occurred in older adults aged ≥85 years for the years 1999–2005. Since 2005, the mortality rate in this age group has continued to increase, but at a slower pace. This study did not directly examine factors that might have contributed to the sharp increase in reported deaths from 1999 to 2005 or the subsequent slowing of this increase. Increases in the mortality rate for Alzheimer’s might be the result of corresponding decreases in mortality rates for competing causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and stroke ( 2 , 6 ).

The increasing rates of Alzheimer’s deaths are not only problematic because of their obvious direct health effects on persons with Alzheimer’s. The debilitating nature of Alzheimer’s means that there are financial and societal costs borne by patients and their families, and by states and counties that operate publicly funded long-term care facilities. It is estimated that total health and long-term care costs for persons with Alzheimer’s and other dementias in the United States will total $259 billion in 2017, more than two thirds of which is expected to be covered by public sources such as Medicare and Medicaid ( 2 ). Additionally, most care provided to older adults with Alzheimer’s who do not live in long-term care facilities is provided by family members or other unpaid caregivers ( 7 ). In 2015, caregivers of persons with dementia, including Alzheimer’s, provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance ( 2 ). These caregiving hours might correspond to increased financial costs for caregivers and decreased work productivity, as caregivers might take leave from work to ensure adequate care is provided. The societal costs are substantial when considered in the context of the estimated 5.5 million U.S. residents who live with Alzheimer’s ( 2 ).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, several factors relating to the assigned cause of death might affect estimates of death involving Alzheimer’s. Evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s deaths reported on death certificates might be underestimates of the actual number of Alzheimer’s deaths in the United States ( 8 ). Because cases were identified using the underlying cause of death, persons with Alzheimer’s but a non-Alzheimer’s underlying cause of death were not identified in this analysis. Second, complications from Alzheimer’s, such as pneumonia, might be reported as the cause of death although the actual underlying cause of death, Alzheimer’s, was not reported on the death certificate. Finally, a person with Alzheimer’s might have dementia assigned as the underlying cause of death rather than a more specific diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.

Some modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity and fewer years of education, have been identified as factors associated with an increased risk for dementia ( 9 , 10 ). Although some treatments have been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer’s, there is no cure or definitive means of prevention ( 2 ). Until Alzheimer’s can be prevented, slowed, or stopped, caregiving for persons with advanced Alzheimer’s will remain a demanding task. An increasing number of Alzheimer’s deaths coupled with an increasing number of patients dying at home suggests that there is an increasing number of caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s. It is likely that these caregivers might benefit from interventions such as education, respite care, and case management that can lessen the potential burden of caregiving.

Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s) is the most common cause of dementia. It currently affects an estimated 5.5 million adults in the United States and is expected to affect 13.8 million U. S. adults aged ≥65 years by 2050.

Age-adjusted rates of Alzheimer’s mortality significantly increased in 41 states and the District of Columbia from 1999 to 2014. Counties with the highest age-adjusted rates were primarily in the Southeast, plus some additional areas in the Midwest and West. Significant increases in Alzheimer’s deaths coupled with an increase in the number of persons with Alzheimer’s dying at home suggest that the burden on caregivers has increased even more than the increase in the number of deaths.

Given the increasing number of Alzheimer’s deaths and persons with Alzheimer’s dying at home, there is a growing number of caregivers who likely can benefit from interventions like education, respite care, and home health assistance; such interventions can lessen the burden of caregiving and can improve the care received by persons with Alzheimer’s.
