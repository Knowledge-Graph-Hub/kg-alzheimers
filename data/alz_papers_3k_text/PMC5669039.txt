Rare coding variants inPLCG2, ABI3andTREM2implicate microglial-mediated innate immunity in Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
We identified rare coding variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a 3-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, 34,174 samples were genotyped using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants ( P <1×10 -4 ) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, an additional 14,997 samples were used to test the most significant stage 2 associations ( P <5×10 -8 ) using imputed genotypes. We observed 3 novel genome-wide significant (GWS) AD associated non-synonymous variants; a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905/p.P522R, P =5.38×10 -10 , OR=0.68, MAF cases =0.0059, MAF controls =0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338/p.S209F, P =4.56×10 -10 , OR=1.43, MAF cases =0.011, MAF controls =0.008), and a novel GWS variant in TREM2 (rs143332484/p.R62H, P =1.55×10 -14 , OR=1.67, MAF cases =0.0143, MAF controls =0.0089), a known AD susceptibility gene. These protein-coding changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified AD risk genes. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to AD development.

## Online Methods
Genotyping was performed at Life and Brain, Bonn, Germany, with the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip v1.0 (N=247,870 variants) or v1.1 (N=242,901 variants). Illumina’s GenTrain version 2.0 clustering algorithm in GenomeStudio or zCall 1 was used for genotype calling. Quality control (QC) filters were implemented for sample call rate excluding samples with >1% missingness, excess autosomal heterozygosity excluding outliers based on <1% and >1% minor allele frequency (MAF) separately, gender discordance, relatedness excluding one of each pair related with IBD ≥ 0.125 (the level expected for first cousins), and population outliers (i.e. non European ancestry). Variants were filtered based on call rate excluding variants with >1% missingness, genotype cluster separation excluding variants with a separation score < 0.4 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) excluding variants with P HWE < 1×10 -4 . Ten principal components (PCs) were extracted using EIGENSTRAT, including the first three PCs as covariates had the maximum impact on the genomic control inflation factor, λ 2 . After QC 6,000 LOAD cases and 2,974 elderly controls (version 1.0; 4,093 LOAD cases and 1,599 controls, version 1.1; 1,907 LOAD cases and 1,375 controls) remained. The version 1.0 array had 244,412 variants available for analysis and 239,814 remained for the version 1.1 array.

All four CHARGE cohorts were genotyped for the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip v1.0. To increase the quality of the rare variant genotype calls, the genotypes for all four studies were jointly called with 62,266 samples from 11 studies at the University of Texas HSC at Houston 3 . Quality control (QC) procedures for the genotype data were performed both centrally at UT Houston and at each study. The central QC procedures have been described previously 3 . Minimum QC included: 1) Concordance checking with GWAS data and removal of problematic samples, 2) Removal of individuals with low genotype completion rate (<90%), 3) Removal of variants with low genotype call rate (<95%), 4) Removal of individuals with sex-mismatches, 5) Removal of one individual from duplicate pairs, 6) Removal of first-degree relatives based on genetically calculated relatedness (IBS > 0.45), with cases retained over controls, 7) Removal of variants not called in over 5% of the individuals and those that deviated significantly form the expected Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium proportions ( P <1×10 -6 ).

Genotyping was performed in subsets at four centers: NorthShore, Miami, WashU, and CHOP (“CHOP” and “ADC7” datasets) on the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip v1.0. One variant rs75932628 (p.R47H) in TREM2 clustered poorly across all ADGC cohorts, and was therefore re-genotyped using a Taqman assay. Data on all samples underwent standard quality control procedures applied to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including excluding variants with call rates <95%, and then filtering samples with call rate <95%. Variants with MAF>0.01 were evaluated for departure from HWE and any variants for P HWE <10 -6 were excluded. Population substructure within each of the five subsets (NorthShore, Miami, WashU, CHOP, and ADC7) was examined using PC analysis in EIGENSTRAT 4 , and population outliers (>6 SD) were excluded from further analyses; the first three PCs were adjusted for as covariates in association testing. Prior to analysis we harmonized the alternate and reference alleles over all datasets. See Supplementary Table 3 for an overview of cohort genotype calling and quality control procedures. All sample genotyping and quality control was performed blind to participant’s disease status.

Twenty-two variants successfully designed for replication genotyping on the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY ® platform. Genotyping was performed at Life and Brain, Bonn, Germany, and the Centre National de Génotypage (CNG), Paris, France. Twenty-one variants were successfully genotyped, with one variant (rs147163004 in ASTN2 ) failing visual cluster plot inspection. An additional nine variants were successfully genotyped using the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY ® platform or Thermo FisherTaqMan ® assay at the CNG, Paris, France in a subset of the replication samples N=16,850 (7,755 cases, 9,095 controls).

Filters were implemented for sample call rate, excluding samples with >10% missingness, and excess autosomal heterozygosity via visual inspection. Variants were filtered based on call rate excluding variants with >10% missingness and HWE excluding variants with P HWE <1×10 -5 in either cases or controls.

Variants were genotyped in 3 different panels and QC was performed in each panel separately. Samples with more than 3 missing genotypes were excluded, as were males heterozygous for X-Chromosome variants present within the genotyped panels. Variants were excluded based on missingness >5%, HWE (in cases and controls separately) <1×10 -5 , and differential missingness between cases and controls <1×10 -5 , for each Country cohort. All variants passed quality control. PCs were determined using previously described methods 19 .

Replication was performed using genotypes from 23 ADGC datasets as described above. Genotyping arrays used have been described in detail before for most datasets, except for the CHAP, NBB, TARCC, and WHICAP datasets. CHAP and WHICAP datasets were genotyped on the Illumina OmniExpress-24 array, while NBB was genotyped on the Illumina 1M platform. TARCC first wave subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray chip, while subjects in the second wave (172 cases and 74 controls) were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 beadchip. Second wave TARCC subjects (TARCC2) were genotyped together with 84 cases and 115 controls from second wave samples ascertained at the University of Miami and Vanderbilt University. All samples used in stage 3 were imputed to the HRC haplotype reference panel 5 , 6 , which includes 64,976 haplotypes with 39,235,157 SNPs that allows imputation down to an unprecedented MAF=0.00008.

Prior to imputation, all genotype data underwent QC procedures that have been described extensively elsewhere 7 , 8 . Imputation was performed on the Michigan Imputation Server ( https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/ ) running MiniMac3 9 , 10 . Genotypes from genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping arrays for 16,175 AD cases and 17,176 cognitive-normal individuals were imputed. Across all samples 39,235,157 SNPs were imputed, with the actual number of SNPs imputed for each individual varying based on the regional density of array genotypes available. As a subset of these samples had also been genotyped as part of stage 1, we examined the imputation quality for critical variants by comparing imputed genotypes to those directly genotyped by the exome array; overall concordance was >99%, while concordance among alternate allele genotypes (heterozygotes and alternate allele homozygotes) was >88.5% on average (N=13,000 samples). Concordance between Stage 3 imputed genotypes and exome chip genotypes for replicated SNPs is reported in Supplementary Table 6 .

We tested association with LOAD using logistic regression modelling for common and low frequency variants (MAF>1%) and implementing maximum likelihood estimation using the score test and ‘seqMeta’ package for rare variation (MAF≤1%). Analyses were conducted globally in the GERAD/PERADES consortium, and for each contributing centre in the CHARGE and ADGC consortia under two models (1) an ‘unadjusted’ model, which included minimal adjustment for possible population stratification, using Country of origin and the first three principal components from PCA, and (2) an ‘adjusted’ model, which included covariates for age, and sex, as well as Country of origin and the first three principal components. Age was defined as the age at onset of clinical symptoms for cases, and the age at last interview for cognitively normal controls.

Meta-analysis for common and low frequency variants were undertaken in METAL using a fixed-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Rare variants were meta-analysed in the SeqMeta R package. In the SeqMeta pipeline, cohort-level analyses generated score statistics through the function ‘prepScores()’ which were captured in *. Rdata objects. These *. Rdata objects contain the necessary information to meta-analyse SKAT analyses: the individual SNP scores, MAF, and a covariance matrix for each unit of aggregation. Using the ‘singlesnpMeta()’ and ‘skatOmeta()’ functions of SeqMeta, the *. Rdata objects for individual studies were meta-analysed. The seqMeta coefficients and standard errors can be interpreted as a ‘one-step‘ approximation to the maximum likelihood estimates. Monomorphic variants in individual studies were not excluded as they contribute to the minor allele frequency information. Three independent analysts confirmed the meta-analysis results.

In the GERAD/PERADES consortium 1,740 participants (888 LOAD cases and 852 controls) did not have age information available and were excluded from the adjusted analyses. Therefore, 16,160 cases and 17,967 controls were included in the unadjusted analyses and 15,272 cases and 17,115 controls were included in the adjusted analyses. The primary analysis utilized the unadjusted model given the larger sample size this provided. See Supplementary Figure 2 for QQ plots of unadjusted and adjusted analyses.

We tested association with LOAD using the score test and ‘seqMeta’ package. Analyses were conducted under the two models described above, in the analysis groups indicated in Supplementary Table 2 . Analyses were undertaken globally in the GERAD/PERADES cohort and by Country in the IGAP cohorts, with the EADI1 cohort only including French participants and the ACE cohort including only Spanish participants. Following the format of the IGAP mega meta-analysis 7 , four PCs were included for the EADI1 dataset, and one in the Italian and Swedish IGAP clusters. Meta-analysis was undertaken in the SeqMeta R package.

Association analyses performed followed Stage 1 and Stage 2 analytical procedures described below, and only variants in ABI3, PLCG2 and TREM2 were examined. For gene-based testing, 10 variants in ABI3 , 35 in PLCG2 , and 13 in TREM2 were examined.

The eight biological pathway clusters previously identified as enriched for association in the IGAP dataset 11 were tested for enrichment in this rare variation study ( Supplementary Table 15 ) in order to test whether the biological enrichments observed in common variants also apply to rare variants. Genes were defined without surrounding genomic sequence, as this yielded the most significant excess of enriched pathways in the common variation dataset 11 . Gene-wide SKAT-O P -values for the variants of interest were combined using the Fisher’s combined probability test. Given the low degree of LD 12 between rare variants our primary analyses did not control for LD between pathway genes. However, as a secondary analysis, the APOE region was removed, and for each pair of pathway genes within 1Mb of each other, the gene with the more significant SKAT-O P -value was removed. This highly conservative procedure removes any potential bias in the enrichment test both from LD between the genes, and also from dropping less significant genes from the analysis.

We also performed pathway analyses on the rare variant data presented here using all 9,816 pathways used previously. The top pathways are related to lipoprotein particles, cholesterol efflux, B-cell differentiation and immune response, and closely parallel the common variant results ( Supplementary Table 16 ).

Previous analysis of normal brain co-expression networks identified 4 gene modules that were enriched for common variants associated with AD risk in the IGAP GWAS. Each of these 4 modules was also found to be enriched for immune-related genes. The 151 genes present in 2 or more of these 4 modules were particularly strongly enriched for IGAP GWAS association 41 . This set of 151 co-expressed genes thus contains genes of relevance to AD aetiology. To identify these genes, and clarify biological relationships between them for future study, protein interaction analysis was performed. First, a list of high-confidence (confidence score >0.7) human protein-protein interactions was downloaded from the latest version (v10) of the STRING database ( http://string-db.org ). Then, protein interaction networks were generated as follows: Choose a gene to start the network (the “seed” gene) For each remaining gene in the set of 151 genes, add it to the network if its corresponding protein shows a high-confidence protein interaction with a protein corresponding to any gene already in the network. Repeat step 2 until no more genes can be added Note the number of genes in the network Repeat, choosing each of the 151 genes in turn as the seed gene.

Choose a gene to start the network (the “seed” gene)

For each remaining gene in the set of 151 genes, add it to the network if its corresponding protein shows a high-confidence protein interaction with a protein corresponding to any gene already in the network.

Repeat step 2 until no more genes can be added

Note the number of genes in the network

Repeat, choosing each of the 151 genes in turn as the seed gene.

The largest protein interaction network resulting from this procedure resulted in a network of 56 genes connected by high-confidence protein interactions. To test whether this network was larger than expected by chance, given the total number of protein-protein interactions for each gene, random sets of 151 genes were generated, with each gene chosen to have the same total number of protein-protein interactions as the corresponding gene in the actual data. Protein networks were generated for each gene as described above, and the size of the largest such network compared to the observed 56-gene network. 1000 random gene sets were generated, and none of them yielded a protein interaction network as large as 56 genes. Note that the procedure for generating the protein interaction network relies only on protein interaction data, and is agnostic to the strength of GWAS or rare-variant association for each gene. Thus the strength of genetic association in the set of 56 network genes can be tested relative to that in the original set of 151 genes without bias.

The set of 56 network genes was tested for association enrichment in the IGAP GWAS using ALIGATOR 13 , as was done in the original pathway analysis, using a range of p-value thresholds for defining significant SNPs (and thus the genes containing those SNPs). The same analysis was also performed on the 95 genes in the module overlap but not the protein interaction network ( Supplementary Table 17 ). It can be seen that the 56 network genes account for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 module overlap genes.

The set of 56 network genes, the set of 151 module overlap genes, and the set of 95 genes in the module overlap but not the network were tested for enrichment of association signal in variants with MAF<1% using the gene set enrichment method described above in section 11. Both the set of 151 genes ( P =1.17×10 -6 ) and the subset of 56 genes ( P =1.08×10 -7 ) show highly significant enrichment for association in the rare variants with MAF<1%. It can be seen that the 56 network genes account for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 module overlap genes ( Supplementary Table 17 ). Again, the subset of 56 genes accounts for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 genes, as the remaining 95 genes have only nominally-significant enrichment ( P =0.043). Both the set of 151 genes ( P =5.15×10 -5 ) and the subset of 56 genes ( P =2.98×10 -7 ) show significant enrichment under a conservative analysis excluding the APOE region and correcting for possible LD between the genes ( Supplementary Table 17 ). Thus, the rare variants show convincing replication of the biological signal observed in the common variant GWAS, and furthermore, the protein network analysis has refined this signal to a set of 56 interacting genes. Given that TREM2 has a highly significant gene-wide p-value ( P =1.01×10 -13 ) among variants with MAF<1%, enrichment analyses were run omitting it. Both the set of 151 genes ( P =2.78×10 -3 ) and the subset of 56 genes ( P =0.010) ( Supplementary Table 18 ) still showed significant enrichment of signal, suggesting that the contribution of rare variants to disease susceptibility in these networks is not restricted to TREM2 . Biological follow-up of genetic results is labour-intensive and expensive. It is therefore important to concentrate such work on the genes that are most important to AD susceptibility. Thus, the rationale for reducing the gene set is that it defines a network of genes that are not only related through co-expression and protein interaction, but also show enrichment for genetic association signal. These genes are therefore strong candidates for future biological study.

We examined mRNA expression of the novel genes PLCG2 and ABI3 in neuropathologically characterized brain post-mortem tissue (508 persons): they are expressed at low levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects from two studies of aging with prospective autopsy (ranked 12,965th out of 13,484 expressed genes) 14 . However, ABI3 and PLCG2 were more highly expressed in purified microglia/macrophage from the cortex of 11 subjects from these cohorts (1740th and 2600th respectively out of the 11,500 expressed genes)( unpublished data ). These findings are consistent with the high levels of expression of both PLCG2 and ABI3 in peripheral monocytes, spleen, and whole blood reported by the ROADmap project and in microglia as reported by Zhang et al 15 . From the same brain tissue, we examined methylation (n=714) 16 and H3K9ac acetylation (n=676) data and found differential methylation at four CpG sites and lower acetylation at two H3K9ac sites adjacent to PLCG2 and ABI3 in relation to increased global neuritic plaque and tangle burden (FDR < 0.05). Similarly, high TREM2 expression has been shown to correlate with increasing neuritic plaque burden 17 .

RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression levels in the temporal cortex of 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies obtained from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and the Banner Sun Health Institute. The human RNA sequencing data is deposited in the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) knowledge portal housed in Synapse ( https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2580853/wiki/66722 ). After QC, our postmortem human cohort has 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies. Assuming two samples of 100 per group, two-sample t-test, same standard deviation, we will have 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.40, 0.49 and 0.59 at p<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, where effect size is the difference in means between two groups divided by the within-group standard deviation. The human RNA sequencing data overview, QC and analytic methods are available at the following Synapse pages, respectively: syn3163039, syn6126114, syn6090802. Multivariable linear regression was used to test for association of gene expression levels with AD diagnosis (Dx) using two different models: In the Simple model, we adjust for age at death, sex, RNA integrity number (RIN), tissue source, and RNAseq flowcell. In the Comprehensive model, we adjust for all these covariates, and brain cell type markers for five cell-specific genes ( CD68 (microglia), CD34 (endothelial), OLIG2 (oligodendroglia), GFAP (astrocyte), ENO2 (neuron)) to account for cell number changes that occur with AD neuropathology. TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are significantly higher in AD temporal cortex prior to correcting for cell types (Simple model), but this significance is abolished after adjusting for cell-specific gene counts (Comprehensive model). This suggests that these elevations are likely a consequence of changes in cell types that occur with AD, most likely microgliosis given that TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are microglia-enriched genes 15 ( Supplementary Table 19 , Supplementary Figure 12 ).
