# Title
A common haplotype lowers PU.1 expression in myeloid cells and delays
onset of Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
A genome-wide survival analysis of 14,406 Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) cases and 25,849 controls identified eight previously reported AD risk loci
and fourteen novel loci associated with age at onset. LD score regression of 220
cell types implicated regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. In
particular, the minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD
onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and
macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical
for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability is enriched within
the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD.
Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affect the expression of mouse
orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial
cells. Our results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces
AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function.

## Results
For the genome-wide survival analysis, we used 14,406 AD case and 25,849
control samples from the IGAP consortium ( Table
1a ). 8,253,925 SNPs passed quality control and were included for
meta-analysis across all cohorts ( Supplementary Table 1 ), which showed little evidence of
genomic inflation (λ = 1.026). Four loci showed genome-wide
significant associations (P < 5×10 −8 ) with
AAOS: BIN1 (P=7.6×10 −13 ), MS4A (P=5.1×10 −11 ), PICALM (P=4.3×10 −14 ),
and APOE (P=1.2×10 −67 )
( Supplementary Fig.
1 ). While SNPs within BIN1 6 , PICALM 6 , 10 , and APOE 6 , 8 – 10 , 22 loci have previously been
shown to be associated with AAO, this is the first time that the MS4A locus is reported to be associated with an AAO-related
phenotype. The minor allele of rs7930318 near MS4A4A is
associated with delayed AAO. Four other AD risk loci previously reported in the
IGAP GWAS 1 showed associations
that reached suggestive significance (P <
1.0×10 −5 ): CR1 (P=1.2×10 −6 ), SPI1/CELF1 (P=5.4×10 −6 ), SORL1 (P=1.8×10 −7 ), and FERMT2 (P=1.0×10 −5 ). The direction of effects
were concordant with the previous IGAP GWAS logistic regression analysis for AD
risk 1 at all suggestive
loci: AD risk-increasing alleles were all associated with a hazard ratio above 1
and earlier AAO, whereas AD risk-decreasing alleles were all associated with a
hazard ratio below 1 and later AAO ( Table
1b , Supplementary
Table 2 ). We also identified 14 novel loci that reached suggestive
significance in the survival analysis, 3 of which (rs116341973, rs1625716, and
rs11074412) were nominally associated with AD risk (Bonferroni-corrected
threshold: P=0.05/22=2.27×10 −3 ) in
the IGAP GWAS ( Table 1b , Supplementary Fig. 2, 3 ).

To further validate the 22 loci with at least suggestive associations to
AAOS, we examined their associations with CSF biomarkers, including total tau,
phosphorylated tau 181 , and Aβ 42 in a dataset of
3,646 Caucasians extended from our previous report 12 ( Table
2 ). Two SNPs showed associations that reached the
Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P <
2.27×10 −3 ). Rs4803758 near APOE showed the most significant associations with levels of CSF phosphorylated
tau 181 (P=3.75×10 −4 ) and CSF
Aβ 42 (P=3.12×10 −5 ),
whereas rs1057233 in the SPI1/CELF1 locus was significantly
associated with CSF Aβ 42 (P=8.24×10 −4 ). Of note, a SNP adjacent to VLDLR , rs7867518, showed the most significant association
with CSF total tau (P=3.02×10 −3 ), but failed
to pass the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. The protective and deleterious
effects in the survival analysis of these three SNPs were concordant with
directionalities of their CSF biomarker associations; for example, the
protective rs1057233 G allele was associated with higher CSF
Aβ 42 levels and the risk rs1057233 A allele was
associated with lower CSF Aβ 42 levels.

Multiple disease-associated GWAS SNPs have been identified as cis -eQTLs of disease genes in disease-relevant tissues/cell
types 23 . We
investigated cis -eQTL effects of the 22 AAOS-associated SNPs
and their tagging SNPs (R 2 ≥ 0.8, listed in Supplementary Table 3 ) in
the BRAINEAC dataset. We identified 4 significant associations
(Bonferroni-corrected threshold: P=0.05/292,000 probes =
1.7×10 −7 ): rs1057233 was associated with MTCH2 expression in the cerebellum
(P=1.20×10 −9 ); rs7445192 was associated
with SRA1 expression averaged across brain regions
(P=7.0×10 −9 ,
1.6×10 −7 for two probes respectively), and
rs2093761 was associated with CR1/CR1L expression in white
matter (P=1.30×10 −7 , Supplementary Table 4 ).
Further analysis using the GTEx dataset 24 identified 50 unique, associated snp-gene pairs across
44 tissues, including 11 snp-gene pairs in various brain regions ( Supplementary Table
5 ).

Recently, genetic and molecular evidence has implicated myeloid cells in
the etiology of AD, including our finding that AD risk alleles are enriched for cis -eQTL effects in monocytes but not CD4+
T-lymphocytes 21 . To
extend this finding and identify relevant cell types in AD, we used stratified
LD score regression to estimate enrichment of AD heritability (measured by
summary statistics from IGAP GWAS 1 ) partitioned by 220 cell type–specific functional
annotations as described by Finucane et al. 25 . We found a significant enrichment of AD heritability
in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage (e.g., 14.49 fold
enrichment, P=3.49×10 −5 in monocytes/CD14
enhancers/H3K4me1 and 12.33 fold enrichment,
P=1.41×10 −6 in B-cells/CD19
enhancers/H3K4me1). In contrast schizophrenia (SCZ) heritability was not
enriched in hematopoietic cells (1.24 fold enrichment, P=0.53, as
measured by summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
[PGC] GWAS 26 )
but was significantly enriched in brain (18.61 fold enrichment,
P=1.38×10 −4 in fetal brain
promoters/H3K4me3, Supplementary Table 6 ). These results suggest that myeloid cells
specifically modulate AD susceptibility.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that cis -eQTL effects of some AD-associated alleles may be specific
to myeloid cells and thus not easily detectable in cis -eQTL
datasets obtained from brain homogenates where myeloid cells (microglia and
other brain-resident macrophages) represent a minor fraction of the tissue.
Therefore, we analyzed cis -eQTL effects of the AAOS-associated
SNPs and their tagging SNPs in human cis -eQTL datasets composed
of 738 monocyte and 593 macrophage samples from the Cardiogenics
consortium 27 . We
identified 14 genes with cis -eQTLs significantly associated
with these SNPs ( Table 3 ). Notably, the
protective rs1057233 G allele, located within the 3′ UTR of SPI1 , was strongly associated with lower expression of SPI1 in both monocytes
(P=1.50×10 −105 ) and macrophages
(P=6.41×10 −87 ) ( Fig. 1a , 1b , 2a ). This allele was also associated
with lower expression of MYBPC3 (monocytes:
P=5.58×10 −23 ; macrophages:
P=4.99×10 −51 ), higher expression of CELF1 in monocytes
(P=3.95×10 −8 ) and lower NUP160 expression in macrophages
(P=5.35×10 −22 ). Each of these genes lies
within the SPI1/CELF1 locus, suggesting complex regulation of
gene expression in this region. Within the MS4A locus, which
contains many gene family members, the minor allele (C) of rs7930318 was
consistently associated with lower expression of MS4A4A in
monocytes (P=8.20×10 −28 ) and MS4A6A in monocytes
(P=4.90×10 −23 ) and macrophages
(P=1.25×10 −9 , Fig. 1b ). Among the novel AAOS-associated loci,
rs5750677 was significantly associated with lower expression of SUN2 in both monocytes
(P=3.66×10 −58 ) and macrophages
(P=3.15×10 −36 ), rs10919252 was associated
with lower expression of SELL in monocytes
(P=7.33×10 −35 ), and rs1625716 was
associated with lower expression of CISD1 in macrophages
(P=5.98×10 −23 , Table 3 ).

We then sought evidence of replication in an independent dataset of
primary CD14+ human monocytes from 432 individuals 28 . We replicated cis -eQTL
associations with expression of SPI1 , MYBPC3 , MS4A4A , MS4A6A , and SELL (Bonferroni-corrected threshold: P=0.05/15421 probes =
3.24×10 −6 ). We found strong evidence for the
association between rs1057233 and SPI1 expression
(P=6.39×10 −102 ) as well as MYBPC3 expression
(P=5.95×10 −33 , Supplementary Table 7 ).
Rs1530914 and rs7929589, both in high LD with rs7930318 (R 2 =
0.99 and 0.87, respectively), were associated with expression of MS4A4A and MS4A6A (P=3.60×10 −8 ,
6.37×10 −15 ), respectively. Finally, rs2272918,
tagging rs10919252, was significantly associated with expression of SELL (P=8.43×10 −16 ).
Interestingly, the minor allele of all of these SNPs showed protective effects
in both AD risk and survival analyses, as well as lower expression of the
associated genes. Further, SPI1 , MS4A4A , MS4A6A , and SELL are specifically
expressed in microglia based on RNA-Seq data 29 – 31 ( Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. 4 ). However, MYBPC3 /Mybpc3 (a myosin binding protein expressed at high
levels in cardiac muscle cells) is either not expressed or expressed at low
levels in human and mouse microglia, respectively. Amongst all genes probed, MYBPC3 (ILMN_1781184) expression is the most highly and
significantly correlated with SPI1 (ILMN_1696463) expression in
both Cardiogenics datasets (Spearman’s rho = 0.54, qval
= 0.00 in monocytes and Spearman’s rho = 0.42, qval
= 0.00 in macrophages) suggesting that low levels of MYBPC3 expression in human myeloid cells are possibly due
to leaky transcription driven by the adjacent highly expressed SPI1 gene.

We performed the coloc test 32 to determine whether AAOS-associated SNPs co-localize
with myeloid cis -eQTLs at the SPI1/CELF1, MS4A and SELL loci. These analyses ( Supplementary Table 8 )
highlighted SPI1 at the SPI1/CELF1 locus as
the strongest and most consistent colocalization target, and the only gene where
the AD survival and gene expression association signals are likely (posterior
probability ≥ 0.8) driven by the same causal genetic variant, in both
monocytes and macrophages (PP.H4.abf of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively). MYBPC3 in the SPI1/CELF1 locus and MS4A6A in the MS4A locus also showed
evidence of colocalization in both myeloid cell types albeit not surviving
posterior probability cutoff in one of them. MS4A4A and MS4A6E in the MS4A locus showed evidence
of co-localization only in monocytes, while SELL did not show
evidence of colocalization.

In light of the strong cis -eQTL effects and
colocalization results described above, we decided to focus subsequent analyses
on SPI1 as the strongest candidate gene underlying the disease
association in myeloid cells.

The AAOS-association landscape shows that highly associated SNPs at the SPI1/CELF1 locus span multiple genes ( Fig. 1a ). In the previous IGAP GWAS 1 , rs10838725 showed the strongest
association at this locus (P=6.7×10 −6 ,
1.1×10 −8 vs. rs1057233:
P=5.4×10 −6 ,
5.9×10 −7 in IGAP stage I, stage I and II
combined, respectively). Rs10838725 is located in the intron of CELF1 , which was assigned as the putative causal gene at
this locus 1 based on proximity
to the index SNP, a criterion that has often proven to be erroneous 14 . In our survival analysis,
however, rs10838725 showed weak association (P=0.12, HR=1.02,
95% CI=0.99–1.05) whereas rs1057233, located in the
3′UTR of a neighboring gene, SPI1 , showed the strongest
association ( Table 1 ,
P=5.4×10 −6 ). The two SNPs exhibit only
moderate linkage disequilibrium in the ADGC subset of the IGAP GWAS
(R 2 =0.21, D’=0.96). Applying conditional
logistic regression analysis of AD risk in the ADGC dataset, we found that
rs1057233 remained significantly associated with AD after adjusting for
rs10838725 (P=3.2×10 −4 ), whereas rs10838725
showed no evidence of association after adjusting for rs1057233
(P=0.66). This suggests that rs1057233 is in stronger LD with the AD
risk causal variant.

The association landscape in the AD survival analysis highly resembles
that of SPI1 cis -eQTL analysis in myeloid cells ( Fig. 1a ). We reasoned that the associations of
rs1057233 with AD-related phenotypes may be explained by the regulation of SPI1 expression in myeloid cells, and that conditional
analysis of the cis -eQTL signal could help us further dissect
this complex locus. Therefore, we conducted conditional cis -eQTL analyses in both Cardiogenics datasets as we did above
using rs1057233 (the top SNP for AD survival) and rs10838725 (the top SNP for AD
risk). In addition, we also examined rs10838698 (a SNP in high LD with rs1057233
that was directly genotyped in the Cardiogenics dataset) and rs1377416, a SNP in
high LD with rs10838725 proposed to be a functional variant in an enhancer near SPI1 that is active in human myeloid cells and in the brain
of a mouse model of AD 19 . It
should be noted that rs1057233 is a functional variant that has been shown to
directly affect SPI1 expression by changing the target sequence
and binding of miR-569 33 .
Rs1057233 and rs10838698 remained significantly associated with SPI1 expression when adjusting for either of the other two
SNPs in both monocytes and macrophages (P <
8.33×10 −3 ). However, conditioning for either of
these two SNPs abolished the associations of rs1377416 and rs10838725 with SPI1 expression ( Supplementary Table 9 ). Thus, the functional variant(s)
mediating the effect on SPI1 expression and AD risk likely
reside(s) in the LD block that includes rs1057233 and rs10838698 but not
rs10838725 and rs1377416 ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

Using HaploReg 34 to
annotate the top AAOS-associated SNP (rs1057233) and its tagging SNPs
(R 2 >= 0.8, Supplementary Table 3 ),
we identified multiple SNPs (e.g, rs10838699 and rs7928163) in tight LD with
rs1057233 that changed the predicted DNA binding motif of SPI1 (PU.1), raising
the possibility of altered self-regulation associated with the minor allele.
Based on these results, one or more of these or other SNPs in very high LD with
rs1057233, could explain the observed associations with SPI1 expression and AD-related phenotypes.

We also conducted Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and
Heterogeneity In Dependent Instruments (HEIDI) tests 23 to prioritize likely causal genes and
variants by integrating summary statistics from our AAOS GWAS and the
Cardiogenics study ( Supplementary Table 10 ). SMR/HEIDI analysis was performed for the SPI1/CELF1 locus using rs1057233, rs10838698, rs10838699,
rs7928163, rs10838725 and rs1377416 as candidate causal variants. In both
monocytes and macrophages, SPI1 was consistently identified as
the most likely gene whose expression levels are associated with AD survival
because of causality/pleiotropy at the same underlying causal variant
(rs1057233, rs10838698, rs10838699, or rs7928163 in the same LD block) (SMR P
< 4.90E-04, Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 6 SNPs tested against 17
probes and HEIDI P ≥ 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Neither conditional analysis nor
SMR/HEIDI analysis could definitively identify a single functional variant among
this set of 4 SNPs in high LD. Functional analyses will be necessary to
determine which SNPs in this LD block directly affects SPI1 expression. Overall, rs1057233 and tagging SNPs are associated with AD risk and
survival, and CSF Aβ 42 . The strong cis -eQTL
effects and colocalization results point to SPI1 as the most
likely candidate gene underlying the disease association at the SPI1 / CELF1 locus.

SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor essential for
the development and function of myeloid cells. We hypothesize that it may
modulate AD risk by regulating the transcription of AD-associated genes
expressed in microglia and/or other myeloid cell types. First, we tested
AD-associated genes for evidence of expression in human microglia 29 as well as presence of PU.1
binding peaks in cis -regulatory elements of these genes using
ChIP-Seq datasets obtained from human monocytes and macrophages 35 . We specifically investigated
112 AD-associated genes, including the 104 genes located within IGAP GWAS
loci 36 and APOE, APP, TREM2 and TREML2 , TYROBP, TRIP4, CD33 , and PLD3 . Among these
genes, 75 had evidence of gene expression in human brain microglial cells, 60 of
which also had evidence of association with PU.1 binding sites in human blood
myeloid cells 35 ( Supplementary Table 11 ).
Further examination of PU.1 binding peaks and chromatin marks/states in human
monocytes confirmed that PU.1 is bound to cis -regulatory
elements of many AD-associated genes, including ABCA7 , CD33 , MS4A4A , MS4A6A , PILRA , PILRB, TREM2, TREML2 , and TYROBP (as well as SPI1 itself, but
notably not APOE ) ( Fig.
2c , Supplementary Fig.
7 ). Together, these results suggest that PU.1 may regulate the
expression of multiple AD-associated genes in myeloid cells.

To further support that PU.1 target genes expressed in myeloid cells may
be associated with AD risk, we used stratified LD score regression 25 to estimate enrichment of AD
heritability (as measured by summary statistics from the IGAP GWAS 1 ) partitioned on the PU.1
cistrome, as profiled by ChIP-Seq in human monocytes and macrophages 35 . We found a significant
enrichment of AD heritability in both monocytes (47.58 fold enrichment,
P=6.94×10 −3 ) and macrophages (53.88 fold
enrichment, P=1.65×10 −3 ), but not SCZ
heritability [as measured by summary statistics from the PGC
GWAS 26 ] ( Supplementary Table 12 ).
Thus, the contribution of the myeloid PU.1 target gene network to disease
susceptibility is specific to AD. However, since PU.1 is a key myeloid
transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes in
myeloid cells, the enrichment of AD risk alleles in PU.1 binding sites could
simply reflect an enrichment of AD GWAS associations for genes that are
expressed in myeloid cells rather than specifically among PU.1 target genes. To
attempt to address this issue, we performed stratified LD score regression of AD
heritability partitioned by functional annotations obtained from SPI1 (marking the PU.1 cistrome) and POLR2AphosphoS5
(marking actively transcribed genes) ChIP-Seq experiments, performed in
duplicate, using a human myeloid cell line (HL60) by the ENCODE
Consortium 37 . We
observed a significant enrichment for SPI1 (PU.1) (34.58 fold
enrichment, P=1.31×10 −3 in first replicate;
58.12 fold enrichment, P=4.95×10 −3 in second
replicate) much stronger than that for POLR2AphosphoS5 (15.78 fold enrichment,
P=1.71×10 −2 in first replicate; 16.34
fold enrichment, P=1.25×10 −1 in second
replicate), consistent with our hypothesis ( Supplementary Table
12 ).

PU.1 target genes are implicated in various biological processes of
myeloid cells that may modulate AD risk. For example, a microglial gene network
for pathogen phagocytosis has been previously implicated in the etiology of
AD 18 . We modulated
levels of PU.1 by Spi1 cDNA overexpression or shRNA knock-down
in BV2 mouse microglial cells, and used zymosan bioparticles labeled with pHrodo
(a pH-sensitive dye that emits a fluorescent signal when internalized in acidic
vesicles during phagocytosis) to measure pathogen engulfment. Analysis of
zymosan uptake by flow cytometry revealed that phagocytic activity is augmented
in BV2 cells overexpressing PU.1 ( Fig. 3a ),
while knock-down of PU.1 resulted in decreased phagocytic activity ( Fig. 3a ). We confirmed overexpression and
knock-down of PU.1 expression levels by western blotting and qPCR ( Fig. 3 ). Phagocytic activity was not changed
in untransfected cells when analyzed by flow cytometry ( Supplementary Fig. 8d, 8e, 8f,
8g ). These data suggest that modulation of PU.1 expression levels
significant changes microglial phagocytic activity in response to fungal targets
(mimicked by zymosan).

To further explore the functional impact of variation in SPI1 expression, we performed qPCR to test whether
differential Spi1 expression in BV2 cells can modulate
expression of genes thought to play important roles in AD pathogenesis and/or
microglial cell function ( Fig. 3 , Supplementary Fig. 9 , Supplementary Table 13,
14 ). We found that levels of some of these genes were affected in
opposing directions by overexpression and knock-down of Spi1 ( Fig. 4a ), while other genes were
affected only by overexpression ( Fig. 4b )
or knock-down ( Fig. 4c ) or not affected at
all ( Supplementary Fig.
9 ). After knock-down of Spi1 in BV2 cells,
expression of Cd33 , Tyrobp , Ms4a4a and Ms4a6d decreased and expression
of Apoe and Clu/ApoJ increased ( Fig. 4a , 4c ).
These data demonstrate that multiple microglial genes, some already implicated
in AD, are selectively perturbed by altered expression of Spi1 .

## Discussion
By performing a large-scale genome-wide survival analysis, we discovered
multiple loci associated with AAOS ( Table 1 ).
The four genome-wide significantly associated loci, BIN1 (P=7.6×10 −13 ), MS4A (P=5.1×10 −11 ), PICALM (P=4.3×10 −14 ), and APOE (P=1.2×10 −67 ), have been previously reported
to be associated with AD risk 1 .
Notably, this is the first study showing that the MS4A locus is
associated with AAOS. The most significantly AAOS-associated SNP at this locus,
rs7930318, shows a protective effect (HR = 0.93, 95% CI =
0.90–.95) in the survival analysis, consistent with the previous IGAP GWAS
logistic regression analysis for AD risk (OR = 0.90, 95% CI
= 0.87–.93).

By combining AAOS and CSF biomarker GWAS results, we provide evidence of AD
association at additional loci ( Table 2 ). In
particular, rs7867518 at the VLDLR locus shows suggestive
associations with both AAOS (P=9.1×10 −6 ) and CSF
tau (P=3.03×10 −3 ). An adjacent SNP (rs2034764) in
the neighboring gene, KCNV2 , has been previously reported to have
suggestive association with AAO 22 .
VLDLR is a receptor for lipoproteins containing APOE 38 and CLU/APOJ 39 , another AD risk gene. Additionally, the VLDLR -5-repeat allele was found to be associated with
dementia 38 . This genetic
and biochemical evidence suggests VLDLR may be linked to AD.

Cis -eQTL analyses of AAOS-associated SNPs revealed limited
associations when using data from brain tissue homogenates, yet identified multiple
candidate genes when using data from myeloid cells, the top candidate causal cell
types for AD based on the stratified LD score regression analysis of AD heritability
presented here. This calls attention to careful selection of relevant cell types in
eQTL studies of disease associations. In particular, by conducting cis -eQTL analyses using monocyte and macrophage datasets, we
discovered associations of AAOS-associated SNPs with the expression of SELL , SPI1 , MYBPC3 , NUP160 , MS4A4A , MS4A6A and SUN2 ( Table 3 ).
Furthermore, we replicated the cis -eQTL associations of rs1057233
with SPI1, MYBPC3 , rs7930318 with MS4A4A , MS4A6A and rs2272918 with SELL in an
independent monocyte dataset. We further showed that SPI1 myeloid cis -eQTLs and AAOS-associated SNPs are not likely to be
colocalized by chance and thus may be in the causal path to AD ( Fig. 1 ). Notably, the minor allele of rs1057233 (G) is
suggestively associated with lower AD risk
(P=5.4×10 −6 ,
5.9×10 −7 in IGAP stage I, stage I and II combined,
respectively) 1 , later AAO
(P=8.4×10 −6 ) and significantly associated
with higher CSF Aβ 42 (P=4.11×10 −4 ), which likely reflects
decreased Aβ aggregation and β-amyloid deposition in the brain.
Furthermore, it is strongly associated with lower SPI1 expression
in human monocytes (P=1.50×10 −105 ) and
macrophages (P=6.41×10 −87 , Table 3 ).

Colocalization analyses using coloc 32 and SMR/HEIDI 23 support the hypothesis that the same causal SNP(s) influence SPI1 expression and AD risk. However, neither conditional nor
SMR/HEIDI analyses were able to pin-point an individual SNP; both approaches
identified an LD block tagged by rs1057233, in which one or more SNPs may
individually or in combination influence both SPI1 expression and
AD risk. rs1057233 changes the target sequence and binding of miR-569 33 , and its tagging SNPs alter
binding motifs of transcription factors including PU.1 itself ( Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7d ).
rs1377416, is located in a predicted enhancer in the vicinity of SPI1 and altered enhancer activity when assayed in
vitro using a reporter construct transfected in BV2 cells 19 . However, rs1057233 remained
significantly associated with AD after conditioning for either rs1377416
(P=1.2×10 −3 ) or the previously reported IGAP
GWAS top SNP rs10838725 (P=3.2×10 −4 ) in the ADGC
dataset. Further, the cis -eQTL association between rs1057233 and SPI1 expression remained significant after conditioning for
either of these SNPs, whereas conditioning for rs1057233 abolished their cis -eQTL associations with SPI1 ( Supplementary Table 9 ). Thus,
rs1057233 and its tagging SNPs likely represent the underlying disease locus and may
modulate AD risk through variation in SPI1 expression.
Interestingly, rs1057233 was previously found to be associated with systemic lupus
erythematosus 33 , body mass
index 40 and proinsulin
levels 41 and may
contribute to the connection between AD, immune cell dysfunction, obesity and
diabetes.

PU.1 binds to cis -regulatory elements of several
AD-associated genes expressed in human myeloid cells, including ABCA7 , CD33, MS4A4A , MS4A6A , TREM2 , and TYROBP ( Fig. 1e , Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Further, PU.1 binds to active enhancers of Trem2 and Tyrobp in ChIP-Seq experiments using
mouse BV2 cells 42 or bone
marrow-derived mouse macrophages 43 . PU.1 is required for the development and function of myeloid and
B-lymphoid cells 44 , 45 . In particular, PU.1 expression is
dynamically and tightly controlled during haematopoiesis to direct the specification
of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells toward the myeloid and
B-lymphoid lineage by progressively partitioning into CD14+
monocytes/macrophages, CD15+ neutrophils, and CD19+ B
cells 46 , which are the
cell types highlighted by our stratified LD score regression analysis. Given its
selective expression in microglia in the brain ( Fig.
2b ), PU.1 may modify microglial cell function through transcriptional
regulation of target genes that act as downstream modulators of AD susceptibility,
as evidenced by the significant enrichment of AD heritability partitioned on the
PU.1 cistrome in human myeloid cells ( Supplementary Table 12 ).

In support of this hypothesis, we also demonstrate that changes in PU.1
expression levels alter phagocytic activity in BV2 mouse microglial cells ( Fig. 3 , Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Knock-down of PU.1 expression reduced
engulfment of zymosan, whereas overexpression of PU.1 increased engulfment of
zymosan, a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist that mimics fungal pathogens. This is
in line with previous data showing decreased uptake of Aβ 42 (also
a TLR2 agonist) in primary microglial cells isolated from adult human brain tissue
and transfected with siRNA targeting SPI1 47 . Interestingly, several AD-associated genes
(e.g., CD33 , TYROBP , TREM2 , TREML2 , CR1 , ABCA7 , APOE , CLU/APOJ ) have been shown to be involved
in the phagocytic clearance of pathogens or host-derived cellular material (e.g.,
β-amyloid, apoptotic cells, myelin debris, lipoproteins, etc.), suggesting a
strong link between perturbation of microglial phagocytosis and AD pathogenesis. In
addition to Cd33, Tyrobp, Apoe and Clu/ApoJ ,
several genes with roles in phagocytosis are dysregulated by altering Spi1 expression, i.e. Cd36 , Fcgr1 , P2ry12 , Itgam , Cx3cr1 , Axl , Ctsb ( Fig. 4a , 4b , 4c ), suggesting a collective and
coordinated effect of Spi1 on the phagocytic activity of BV2
cells.

Our genetic analyses show that the protective allele at the MS4A locus is associated with lower expression of MS4A4A and MS4A6A in human myeloid cells, and
the BV2 experiment demonstrated that lower expression of Spi1 (which is protective in humans) led to lower expression of Ms4a4a and Ms4a6d (mouse ortholog of MS4A6A ), which are
also associated with reduced AD risk in humans. Transcriptomic and proteomic
analyses of microglial cells suggested a microglial homeostatic signature that is
perturbed during aging and under pathological conditions 48 . It will be valuable to test whether
genetically altered SPI1 levels prime microglia to exacerbate or
alleviate transcriptional responses that occur during aging or disease development.
Together with genetic variation in myeloid genes associated with AD as an amplifier, SPI1 may be a master regulator capable of tipping the balance
toward a neuroprotective or neurotoxic microglial phenotype.

PU.1 expression levels regulate multiple myeloid/microglial cell
functions 47 , including
proliferation, survival and differentiation, that could also modulate AD risk.
Indeed, expression of Il34 and Csf1 , soluble
factors that bind to Csf1r and required for microglial development
and maintenance in vivo 49 , were elevated after knock-down of Spi1 ,
while expression of Csf1r was reduced ( Fig. 4a , 4c ).
Interestingly, inhibition of Csf1r in a 3xTg-AD mouse model led to
a reduction in the number of microglia associated with β-amyloid plaques and
improved cognition 50 . These
findings suggest the importance of analyzing cell proliferation, survival,
differentiation, and migration phenotypes with differential Spi1 expression, because Spi1 levels modulate expression of Ccl2 and Cxcl2 ( Fig. 4a ), which are MCP1 and MIP2α proteins that help
recruitcirculating monocytes and neutrophils to the brain to promote
neuroinflammation. In addition, knocking down Spi1 reduced
expression of a microgliosis marker Aif1 (Iba1) along with Il1b , Nos2 , Ptgs2 , Arg1 and Nlrp3 ( Fig. 4a , 4c ), suggesting that
decreased Spi1 expression may blunt the pro-inflammatory response
of microglial cells to improve disease outcomes. Interestingly, expression of Cx3cr1 and Axl were elevated upon knock-down
of Spi1 ( Fig. 4c ), raising the
possibility that beneficial effects of changes in Spi1 expression
are exerted through modulation of synaptic or neuronal clearance. Further
experimental investigation of these phenotypes may shed light on the mechanisms of SPI1 modulation of AD risk. Of note, overexpression and
knock-down of Spi1 in BV2 cells produce different and often
opposite changes in expression of the genes profiled here, possibly driving
alternative phenotypes that may underlie detrimental and protective roles of
PU.1.

In summary, by combining AD survival and endophenotype GWAS analyses, we
replicated and discovered multiple genetic loci associated with AAOAAOS.
Specifically, we nominate SPI1 as the gene responsible for disease
association at the previously reported CELF1 locus. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor expressed in
microglia and other myeloid cells that directly regulates other AD-associated genes
expressed in these cell types. Our data suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces risk for AD, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach to the
treatment of AD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AAOS-associated SNPs within the
MS4A gene cluster are associated with eQTLs in myeloid cells for both MS4A4A and MS4A6A . Specifically, the allele
associated with reduced AD risk is associated with lower MS4A4A and MS4A6A expression. This is consistent with the observation that
lowering SPI1 expression, which is protective for AD risk, also
lowers MS4A4A and MS4A6A expression. These results
reinforce the emerging genetic and epigenetic association between AD and a network
of microglial expressed genes 2 , 5 , 17 – 21 ,
highlighting the need to dissect their functional mechanisms.

## Online Methods
The final meta-analysis dataset consists of samples from the
Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), Genetic and
Environmental Risk in Alzheimer’s Disease (GERAD), European
Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative (EADI), and Cohorts for Heart and Aging
Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE). The study cohorts consist of
case-control and longitudinal cohorts. For all studies, written informed consent
was obtained from study participants or, for those with substantial cognitive
impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian, or other proxy, and the study
protocols for all populations were reviewed and approved by the appropriate
Institutional review boards. Details of ascertainment and diagnostic procedures
for each dataset extend from details previously described 1 – 5 and are documented below:

The imputed ADGC sample that passed quality control procedures
comprised of 8,617 AD cases and 9,765 control subjects from GWAS datasets
assembled by the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC).
Details of ascertainment and diagnostic procedures for each data set were as
previously described 2 .

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the
Genetic and Environmental Risk for Alzheimer’s disease (GERAD)
Consortium. The imputed GERAD sample comprised 3,177 AD cases and 7,277
controls with available age and gender data. A subset of this sample has
been used in this study, comprising 2,615 cases and 1,148 elderly screened
controls. Cases and elderly screened controls were recruited by the Medical
Research Council (MRC) Genetic Resource for AD (Cardiff University;
Institute of Psychiatry, London; Cambridge University; Trinity College
Dublin), the Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) Collaboration
(University of Nottingham; University of Manchester; University of
Southampton; University of Bristol; Queen’s University Belfast; the
Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA), Oxford
University); Washington University, St Louis, United States; MRC PRION Unit,
University College London; London and the South East Region AD project
(LASER-AD), University College London; Competence Network of Dementia (CND)
and Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Germany; the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)AD Genetics Initiative. 6,129 population
controls were drawn from large existing cohorts with available GWAS data,
including the 1958 British Birth Cohort (1958BC) ( http://www.b58cgene.sgul.ac.uk ), the KORA F4 Study and the
Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. All AD cases met criteria for either probable
(NINCDS-ADRDA, DSM-IV) or definite (CERAD) AD. All elderly controls were
screened for dementia using the MMSE or ADAS-cog, were determined to be free
from dementia at neuropathological examination or had a Braak score of 2.5
or lower. Genotypes from all cases and 4,617 controls were previously
included in the AD GWAS by Harold and colleagues (2009). Genotypes for the
remaining 2,660 population controls were obtained from WTCCC2. Imputation of
the dataset was performed using IMPUTE2 and the 1000 genomes ( http://www.1000genomes.org/ ) Dec2010 reference panel (NCBI
build 37.1). The imputed data was then analysed using logistic regression
including covariates for country of origin, gender, age and 3 principal
components obtained with EIGENSTRAT software based on individual genotypes
for the GERAD study participants.

This study incorporated imputed summary results from the GERAD1
genome-wide association study. GERAD Acknowledgements: Cardiff

All AD cases were ascertained by neurologists from Bordeaux, Dijon,
Lille, Montpelier, Paris, and Rouen, with clinical diagnosis of probable AD
established according to the DSM-III-R and National Institute of
Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria 51 , 52 . Controls were recruited from Lille, Rouen, Nantes
and from the 3C Study 51 .
This cohort is a population-based, prospective study of the relationship
between vascular factors and dementia. It has been carried out in three
French cities: Bordeaux (southwest France), Montpelier (southeast France)
and Dijon (central eastern France). A sample of non-institutionalized,
subjects over 65 years was randomly selected from the electoral rolls of
each city. Between January 1999 and March 2001, 9,686 subjects meeting the
inclusion criteria agreed to participate. Following recruitment, 392
subjects withdrew from the study. Thus, 9,294 subjects were finally included
in the study (2,104 in Bordeaux, 4,931 in Dijon and 2,259 in Montpellier).
At 8 years of follow up, 664 individuals suffered from AD with 167 prevalent
and 497 incident cases. The other individuals were considered as controls.
9863 DNA samples that passed DNA quality control were genotyped with
Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips. Following quality control procedures, a
final sample size of 5,803 3C individuals (387 AD cases and 5,416 controls,
cohort dataset) and 2,298 non-3C individuals (1,420 AD cases and 878
controls, case-control dataset) was included in this study.

Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS): The CHS is a prospective
population-based cohort study of risk factors for vascular and metabolic
disease that in 1989–90, enrolled adults aged ≥65 years, at
four field centers located in North Carolina, California, Maryland and
Pennsylvania. The original predominantly Caucasian cohort of 5,201 persons
was recruited from a random sample of people on Medicare eligibility lists
and an additional 687 African-Americans were enrolled subsequently for a
total sample of 5,8882. DNA was extracted from blood samples drawn on all
persons who consented to genetic testing at their baseline examination in
1989–90. In 2007–2008, genotyping was performed at the
General Clinical Research Center’s Phenotyping/Genotyping Laboratory
at Cedars-Sinai using the Illumina 370CNV Duo ® BeadChip system on
3,980 CHS participants who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at
baseline. The 1,908 persons excluded for prevalent CVD had prevalent
coronary heart disease (n=1,195), congestive heart failure
(n=86), peripheral vascular disease (n=93), valvular heart
disease (n=20), stroke (n=166) or transient ischemic attack
(n=56). Some persons had more than one reason to be excluded and for
these individuals only the initial exclusionary event is listed. Because the
other cohorts were predominantly white, the African American CHS
participants were excluded from this analysis to limit errors secondary to
population stratification. Among white participants genotyping was attempted
in 3,397 participants and was successful in 3295 persons. After excluding
persons that had either died prior to the start of the CHS cognition study
in 1992 (see section 3 for details), could not be evaluated completely for
baseline cognitive status, and persons that had dementia other than AD, a
sample of 2,049 persons was available. The CHS study protocols were approved
by the Institutional review boards at the individual participating
centers.

The AD sample for this study included all prevalent cases identified
in 1992 and incident events identified between 1992 and December 20063.
Briefly, persons were examined annually from enrollment to 1999. The
examination included a 30 minute screening cognitive battery. In
1992–94 and again, in 1997–99, participants were invited to
undergo brain MRI and detailed cognitive and neurological assessment as part
of the CHS Cognition Study. Persons with prevalent dementia were identified,
and all others were followed until 1999 for the development of incident
dementia and AD. Since then, CHS participants at the Maryland and
Pennsylvania centers have remained under ongoing dementia
surveillance 53 .

Beginning in 1988/89, all participants completed the Modified
Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and the DSST at their annual visits,
and the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) from 1994 to 1998. The Telephone
Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was used when participants did not
come to the clinic. Further information on cognition was obtained from
proxies using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the
Elderly (IQCODE), and the dementia questionnaire (DQ). Symptoms of
depression were measured with the modified version of the Center for
Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). In 1991–94, 3,608
participants had an MRI of the brain and this was repeated in
1997–98. The CHS staff also obtained information from participants
and next-of-kin regarding vision and hearing, the circumstances of the
illness, history of dementia, functional status, pharmaceutical drug use,
and alcohol consumption. Data on instrumental activities of daily living
(IADL), and activities of daily living (ADL) were also collected.

Persons suspected to have cognitive impairment based on the
screening tests listed above underwent a neuropsychological and a
neurological evaluation. The neuropsychological battery included the
following tests: the American version of the National Reading test (AMNART),
Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices, California Verbal Learning
Test (CVLT), a modified Rey-Osterreith figure, the Boston Naming test, the
Verbal fluency test, the Block design test, the Trails A and B tests, the
Baddeley & Papagno Divided Attention Task, the Stroop, Digit Span
and Grooved Pegboard Tests. The results of the neuropsychological battery
were classified as normal or abnormal (>1.5 standard deviations
below individuals of comparable age and education) based on normative data
collected from a sample of 250 unimpaired subjects. The neurological exam
included a brief mental status examination, as well as a complete
examination of other systems. The examiner also completed the Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hachinski Ischemic
Scale. After completing the neurological exam, the neurologist classified
the participant as normal, having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or
dementia.

International diagnostic guidelines, including the NINCDS-ADRDA
criteria for probable and possible AD and the ADDTC’s State of
California criteria for probable and possible vascular dementia (VaD) with
or without AD, were followed. CHS identified 3 subtypes: possible/probable
AD without VaD (categorized as pure AD, included in all AD) and mixed AD
(for cases that met criteria for both AD and VaD, included in all-AD), and,
possible/probable VaD without AD (excluded from current study).

Framingham Heart Study (FHS): The FHS is a three-generation,
single-site, community-based, ongoing cohort study that was initiated in
1948. It now comprises three generations of participants including the
Original cohort followed since 1948 (n=5,209) 54 , their Offspring and spouses of the
offspring (n=5,216) followed since 1971 55 ; and children from the largest
Offspring families enrolled in 2000 (Gen 3) 56 . Participants in the Original and
Offspring cohorts are used in these analyses, but Gen 3 participants were
not included since they are young (mean age 40±9 years in 2000) and
none had developed Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The Original cohort
enrolled 5,209 men and women who comprised two-thirds of the adult
population then residing in Framingham, Massachusetts. Survivors continue to
receive biennial examinations. The Offspring cohort comprises 5,124 persons
(including 3,514 biological offspring) who have been examined approximately
once every 4 years. Almost all the FHS Original and Offspring participants
are white/Caucasian. FHS participants had DNA extracted and provided consent
for genotyping in the 1990s. All available eligible participants were
genotyped at Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) through an NHLBI funded SNP-Health
Association Resource (SHARe) project using the Affymetrix GeneChip ®
Human Mapping 500K Array Set and 50K Human Gene Focused Panel ®. In
272 persons, small amounts of DNA were extracted from stored whole blood and
required whole genome amplification prior to genotyping. Cell lines were
available for most of the remaining participants. Genotyping was attempted
in 5,293 Original and Offspring cohort participants, and 4,425 persons met
QC criteria. Failures (call rate <97%, extreme
heterozygosity or high Mendelian error rate) were largely restricted to
persons with whole-genome amplified DNA and DNA extracted from stored serum
samples. In addition, since the persons with whole genome amplified DNA
represent a group of survivors who may differ from the others we included
whole genome amplified status as a covariate in FHS analyses. After
exclusion of prevalent dementia, dementia other than AD, and missing values,
a sample of 2,208 participants was available for this project. The FHS
component of this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Boston Medical Center.

The Original cohort of the FHS has been evaluated biennially since
1948, was screened for prevalent dementia and AD in 1974–76 and has
been under surveillance for incident dementiaand AD since then 57 – 59 . The Offspring have been examined
once every 4 years and have been screened for prevalent dementia with a
neuropsychological battery and brain MRI 60 , 61 . In order
to be consistent with the sampling frame for the AGES and CHS samples, we
excluded FHS subjects with a baseline age <65 yrs at the time of DNA
draw which was in the 1990s. To minimize survival biases, Original cohort
and Offspring participants who developed dementia prior to the date of DNA
draw were treated as prevalent cases, and subsequent events in the Original
cohort occurring prior to December 2006 were included in the incident
analyses.

At each clinic exam, participants receive questionnaires, physical
examinations and laboratory testing; between examinations they remain under
surveillance (regardless of whether or not they live in the vicinity) via
physician referrals, record linkage and annual telephone health history
updates. Methods used for dementia screening and follow-up have been
previously described 57 , 62 . Briefly, surviving cohort
members who attended biennial examination cycles 14 and 15 (May
1975-November 1979) were administered a standardized neuropsychological test
battery to establish a dementia-free cohort. Beginning at examination cycle
17 (1982), the MMSE was administered biennially to the cohort. A MMSE score
below the education-specific cutoff score,a decline of 3 or more points on
subsequent administrations, a decline of more than 5 points compared with
any previous examination, or a physician or family referral prompted further
in-depth testing. The Offspring cohort that was enrolled in 1971 has
undergone 8 re-examinations, one approximately every 4 years. Starting at
the 2nd Offspring examination, participants were questioned regarding any
subjective memory complaints and since the 5th Offspring examination
participants have been administered the MMSE at each visit. In addition
concurrent with the 7th and 8th Offspring examinations (between 1999 and
2004 and then again between 2005 and 2009) surviving Original cohort and all
eligible and consenting Offspring participants have undergone volumetric
brain MRI and neuropsychological testing 60 , 61 . The
neuropsychological test battery included the Reading subtest of the Wide
Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3), the Logical Memory and the Paired
Associates Learning tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Visual
Reproduction and Hooper Visual Organization Tests, Trails A and B, the
Similarities subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence test, the 30-iterm
version of the Boston Naming Test and at the second assessment only, the
Digit Span, Controlled Word Association and Clock Drawing Tests. Offspring
participants suspected to have cognitive impairment based on their MMSE
scores, participant, family or physician referral, hospital records or
performance in the neuropsychological test battery described above were
referred for more detailed neuropsychological and neurological
evaluation.

Each participant thus identified underwent baseline neurologic and
neuropsychological examinations. Neurologists (trained in geriatric
behavioral assessment) supplemented their clinical assessment with a few
structured cognitive tests and administered the Clinical Dementia Rating
(CDR). Persons were reassessed systematically for the onset of at least mild
dementia. A panel consisting of at least 1 neurologist (S.A., P.A.W., or
S.S.) and 1 neuropsychologist (R.A.) reviewed all available medical records
to arrive at a final determination regarding the presence or absence of
dementia, the date of onset of dementia, and the type of dementia. For this
determination, we used data from the neurologist’s examination,
neuropsychological test performance, Framingham Study records, hospital
records, information from primary care physicians, structured family
interviews, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging records, and
autopsy confirmation when available. All individuals identified as having
dementia satisfied the DSM-IV criteria, had dementia severity equivalent to
a CDR of 1 or greater, and had symptoms of dementia for at least 6 months.
All individuals identified as having Alzheimer-related dementia met the
NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for definite, probable, or possible AD. Vascular
Dementia was diagnosed using the ADDTC criteria but the presence of vascular
dementia did not disqualify a participant from obtaining a concomitant
diagnosis of AD if indicated. The recruitment of Original cohort
participants at FHS had occurred long before the DNA collection with the
result that the majority of dementia events in the FHS (although ascertained
prospectively) were prevalent at the time of DNA collection or these persons
had died prior to DNA draw and were thus excluded from analyses of incident
disease. Due to the limited number of incident dementia and AD events in the
Framingham Offspring only the Original cohort were included in our analyses
of incident events.

Rotterdam Study: The Rotterdam Study enrolled inhabitants from a
district of Rotterdam (Ommoord) aged ≥55 years (N=7,983,
virtually all white) at the baseline examination in 1990–93 when
blood was drawn for genotyping 63 . It aims to examine the determinants of disease and
health in the elderly with a focus on neurogeriatric, cardiovascular, bone,
and eye disease. All inhabitants of Ommoord aged ≥55 years (n
= 10,275) were invited and the participation rate was 78%.
All participants gave written informed consent to retrieve information from
treating physicians. Baseline measurements were obtained from 1990 to 1993
and consisted of an interview at home and two visits to the research center
for physical examination. Survivors have been re-examined three times: in
1993–1995, 1997–1999, and 2002–2004. All persons
attending the baseline examination in 1990–93 consented to
genotyping and had DNA extracted. This DNA was genotyped using the Illumina
Infinium II HumanHap550chip v3·0 ® array in
2007–2008 according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Genotyping was attempted in persons with high-quality extracted DNA
(n=6,449). From these 6,449, samples with low call rate
(<97.5%, n=209), with excess autosomal
heterozygosity (>0.336, n=21), with sex-mismatch
(n=36), or if there were outliers identified by the IBS clustering
analysis (>3 standard deviations from population mean, n=102
or IBS probabilities >97%, n=129) were excluded from
the study population with some persons meeting more than one exclusion
criterion; in total, 5,974 samples were available with good quality
genotyping data, 42 persons were excluded since they did not undergo
cognitive screening at baseline, hence their cognitive status was uncertain.
An additional 61 persons were excluded because they suffered from dementia
other than AD at baseline. After exclusion of prevalent dementia, a sample
of 5752 persons was available. The Rotterdam Study (including its brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological components) has been
approved by the institutional review board (Medical Ethics Committee) of the
Erasmus Medical Center and the Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Sports Participants were screenedfor prevalent dementia in 1990–93
using a three-stage process; those free of dementia remained under
surveillance for incident dementia, a determination made using records
linkage and assessment at three subsequent re-examinations. We included all
prevalent cases and all incident events up to 31st December 2007.

Screening was done with the MMSE and GMS organic level for all
persons. Screen-positives (MMSE <26 or Geriatric Mental Schedule
(GMS) organic level >0) underwent the CAMDEX. Persons who were
suspected of having dementia underwent more extensive neuropsychological
testing. When available, imaging data were used. In addition, all
participants have been continuously monitored for major events (including
dementia) through automated linkage of the study database with digitized
medical records from general practitioners, the Regional Institute for
Outpatient Mental Health Care and the municipality. In addition physician
files from nursing homes and general practitioner records of participants
who moved out of the Ommoord district were reviewed twice a year. For
suspected dementia events, additional information (including neuroimaging)
was obtained from hospital records and research physicians discussed
available information with a neurologist experienced in dementia diagnosis
and research to verify all diagnoses. Dementia was diagnosed in accordance
with internationally accepted criteria for dementia (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, DSM-III-R),
and AD using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible, probable and definite
AD. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke–Association Internationale pour la Recherche et
l’Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria were used to
diagnose vascular dementia. The final diagnosis was determined by a panel of
a neurologist, neurophysiologist, and research physician and the diagnoses
of AD and VaD were not mutually exclusive.

To determine the power to detect genetic variants associated with
age at onset, we ran analyses using Proc Power in SAS. The analysis was run
using minor allele frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 0.50, OR 1.1 to 1.75 and
sample size of 45,000. Other factors, such as genetic heterogeneity and
gene-environment interaction are likely to affect these estimates. Alpha was
adjusted to 5×10 −8 . For variants with a MAF of
0.15, we would have approximately 80% power to detect effects for OR
> 1.23 or < 0.81; for variants with a MAF of 0.3, we would
have approximately 80% power to detect effects for OR > 1.18
(or < 0.85).

CSF samples were obtained from the Knight-ADRC (N=805), ADNI-1
(N=390), ADNI-2 (N=397), the Biomarkers for Older Controls at
Risk for Dementia (BIOCARD) (N=184), Mayo Clinic (N=433), Lund
University (Swedish) (N=293), University of Pennsylvania (Penn)
(N=164), University of Washington (N=375), The
Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (500) and Saarland University
(German) (N=105).

Cases were diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT)
according to the NINCDS-ADRDA 20 . Control individuals were evaluated using the same criteria
and showed no symptoms of cognitive impairment. All participants provided
written informed consent and the ethics committee approved the informed consent
procedure (IRB ID #: 201105364). 787 additional samples with biomarker
data used in the analyses were obtained from the ADNI database
(adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership,
led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI
has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and
neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). CSF in
all studies was collected in a standardized manner 12 , 64 – 67 .
Biomarker measurements within each study were conducted using internal standards
and controls to achieve consistency and reliability. However, differences in the
measured values between studies were observed which are likely due to
differences in the antibodies and technologies used for quantification (standard
ELISA with Innotest for Knight-ADRC, UW, Swedish, German, and Mayo versus
Luminex with AlzBio3 for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, BIOCARD and Penn), ascertainment and/or
handling of the CSF after collection. CSF Aβ 42 and
ptau 181 values were log transformed in order to approximate a
normal distribution. Because the CSF biomarker values were measured using two
different platforms (standard ELISA with Innotest and Luminex with AlzBio3), we
did not combine the raw data. For the combined analyses, we standardized the
mean of the log-transformed values from each dataset to zero. No significant
differences in the transformed and standardized CSF values were found between
cohorts. We also performed meta-analyses for the most significant SNPs by
combining the P values for each independent dataset using METAL 68 . No major differences were
found between the joint-analyses and the meta-analyses.

For survival analysis, we excluded cases with AAO below 60 and cases
with prevalent stroke. For CSF analysis, individuals under age 45 years were
removed because prior studies have demonstrated that the relationship between
CSF Aβ 42 levels and age appears to differ in individuals
below 45 years vs. those above 45 years 69 . Of the remaining individuals in both analyses, we
excluded individuals who had > 5% missing genotype rates, who
showed a discrepancy between reported sex and sex estimated on the basis of
genetic data, or who showed evidence of non-European ancestry based on principal
component analysis using PLINK1.9 70 . We identified unanticipated duplicates and cryptic
relatedness using pair-wise genome-wide estimates of proportion identity by
descent (IBD) using PLINK. When duplicate samples or a pair of samples with
cryptic relatedness was identified, the sample with the lower genotyping call
rate was removed. We excluded potentially related individuals so that all
remaining individuals have kinship coefficient below 0.05. Finally, we excluded
individuals with missing disease status, age or gender information.

To control for genotype quality, we excluded SNPs with missing genotypes
in > 5% of individuals in each dataset for survival analysis,
and > 2% for CSF association analysis. For the EADI cohort,
variants with minor allele frequency < 1%, Hardy-Weinberg P
value < 1×10 −6 and missingness >
2% were removed prior to imputation. Genome-wide genotype imputation was
performed using IMPUTE2 71 with
1000 Genomes reference haplotypes. We excluded imputed SNPs with an IMPUTE2
quality score < 0.5 for survival analysis. For CSF association, we
excluded SNPs with an IMPUTE2 quality score of < 0.3 since the dataset
was only used for follow-up. In the ADGC, GERAD, CHARGE, and CSF datasets, we
then removed SNPs that failed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls
calculated based on the imputed best-guess genotypes using a P value threshold
of 1×10 −6 . We excluded SNPs with minor allele
frequency ≤ 0.02. Finally, we excluded SNPs with available statistics in
only one consortium dataset in the meta-analysis. The number of filtered samples
and SNPs in each of the above steps are recorded in Supplementary Table
1 .

We conducted a genome-wide Cox proportional hazards regression 72 assuming an additive effect
from SNP dosage. The Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented in the R
survival analysis package. We incorporated sex, site and the first three
principal components from EIGENSTRAT 30 in all our regression models to control for their
effects. For EADI, sex and four principal components were included in the model.
For the Cox model, the time scale is defined as age in years, where age is age
at onset for cases and age at last assessment for controls. The formula applied
is as followed: h ( t | X ) = h 0 ( t ) exp ( ∑ i = 1 p β i X i ) where X = (X1, X2, …, Xp) are the
observed values of covariates for subject i. The Cox model has previously been
shown to be applicable to case-control datasets without an elevated type 1 error
rate nor overestimation in effect sizes 73 , 74 . The model
assumes log-linearity and proportional hazards. The assumption of log-linearity
is common in the additive logistic regression used in a typical GWAS. We
validated the assumption of proportional hazards assumed by the Cox model by
conducting the Schoenfeld test in the 22 prioritized SNPs. None of the SNPs has
a Schoenfeld P value, which is the P value for Pearson product-moment
correlation between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and time, lower than 0.035
(multiple test correction threshold = 0.00227) in any of the 7 cohorts.
Further, only 3 out of the 148 P values were less than 0.05, suggesting that the
time proportionality assumption is unlikely to be violated in these associations
( Supplementary Table
1 ). Similarly, the Schoenfeld test was conducted for all 22 SNP
association models on the covariates in the ADGC and GERAD cohort ( Supplementary Table 1 ).
We also examined the effect sizes of our candidate SNPs in these cohorts and
found consistent effect sizes ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) in the 3 retrospective case-control cohorts
(ADGC, GERAD, EADI case-control) and 4 prospective cohorts (EADI-prospective,
CHARGE FHS, CHS and Rotterdam).

After the analysis of each dataset, we carried out an inverse-variance
meta-analysis on the results using METAL 26 , applying a genomic control to adjust for inflation in
each dataset. Of the 751 suggestive SNPs (P <
1×10 −5 ), we found these SNPs to show lower
standard errors and confidence intervals with the increasing number of cohorts
showing consistent directionalities of effect. Particularly, the average
standard error for SNPs showing 1 to 7 consistent directionalities ranges from
0.171, 0.109, 0.0744, 0.0346, 0.0234, 0.0173 to 0.01795 ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Thus, we
limited our final analysis to SNPs that showed consistent directionalities of
effect in at least 6 out of the 7 datasets included in the meta-analysis. The
association graphs of results from loci of interest were plotted using
LocusZoom 75 .

For the CSF datasets, we performed multivariate linear regression for
CSF Aβ 42 and tau, and ptau 181 association
adjusting for age, gender, site, and the first three principal components using
PLINK.

We examined the effect of top survival and CSF SNPs on gene expression
using published databases. For general brain expression eQTL analysis, we
queried the BRAINEAC eQTL data provided by the UK human Brain Expression
Consortium (see URLs).

We conducted leukocyte-specific analysis using the Cardiogenics
dataset 27 composed of
738 monocytes and 593 macrophages samples. For each probeset – imputed
SNP pair, a simple linear regression was used to analyze the data separately for
monocytes and macrophages: y i = α + β x i + ε i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n , ε i ~ N ( 0 , σ 2 ) where i is the subject index, x is the effective
allele copy number, and y i is the covariates-adjusted, inverse-normal
transformed gene expression. Significance of cis (SNP within
±1Mb of the closest transcript end) eQTL effects were quantified with a
Wald test on the ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator of the coefficient
β, obtained with R. The distribution of the Wald test P values under the
null hypothesis of no correlation between genotype and gene expression was
estimated by rerunning the same analysis on a null dataset obtained by permuting
the expression samples identifiers. For additional monocyte eQTL analysis, we
queried statistics from Fairfax et al. 28 to validate findings in the Cardiogenics dataset.

For conditional analysis, we performed analysis for SPI1 (probe: ILMN_1696463) against all SNPs within
±2Mb from the closest transcript end, by including the following SNPs
effective allele copy numbers as covariates in the linear regression model, one
at a time: rs1057233, rs10838698, rs7928163, rs10838699, rs10838725, rs1377416.
Significance was again assessed with a two-sided Wald test on the OLS estimator
of the coefficient β.

Cell-type specific gene expression in the human and mouse brain was
queried from brain RNA-Seq databases described in Zhang et al. 29 , 30 and Bennett et al. 31 and plotted using custom R scripts (see URLs). The
mouse astrocytes-FACS and astrocytes-immunopanned in mouse were collapsed into a
single astrocyte cell type.

We utilized HaploReg 34 to annotate the regulatory element of the significantly associated SNPs and
their tagging SNPs. The myeloid chromatin marks/states and PU.1 ChIP-Seq data at
genetic loci were further examined through the Washington University Epigenome
browser 76 using the
public Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium public tracks hub as well as custom track
hubs for human monocytes and macrophages (hg19) (see URLs).

Colocalization analysis of genetic variants associated with AD and
myeloid gene expression was performed using AAOS GWAS SNP and myeloid (monocyte
and macrophage) eQTL datasets from Cardiogenics as inputs. Overlapping SNPs were
retained within the hg19 region chr11:47100000-48100000 for the SPI1/CELF1 locus, chr11:59500000-60500000 for the MS4A locus, and chr1:169300000-170300000 for the SELL locus. Colocalization analysis of AD- and gene
expression-associated SNPs was performed using the ‘coloc.abf’
function in the ‘coloc’ R package (v2.3-1). Default settings
were used as prior probability of association: 1×10 −4 for trait 1 (gene expression), 1×10 −4 for trait 2
(AD) and 1×10 −5 for both traits. SMR/HEIDI (v0.65)
analysis was performed as described in Zhu et al. 23 and the companion website (see URLs).
The ADGC subset of the IGAP GWAS dataset was used to perform the LD
calculations.

We used LDSC (LD SCore, v1.0.0) regression analysis 25 to estimate heritability of AD and
schizophrenia from GWAS summary statistics (excluding the APOE
[chr19:45000000–45800000] and MHC/HLA
[chr6:28477797–33448354] regions) partitioned by PU.1
ChIP-Seq binding sites in myeloid cells, as described in the companion website
(see URLs) and controlling for the 53 functional annotation categories of the
full baseline model. GWAS summary statistics for ADand schizophrenia (SCZ) were
downloaded from the IGAP consortium 1 (stage 1 dataset) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
(PGC) 26 (pgc.cross.scz
dataset), respectively (see URLs). SPI1 (PU.1) bindings sites were downloaded as
filtered and merged ChIP-Seq peaks in BED format from the ReMap
database 77 (GEO:GSE31621, SPI1, blood monocyte and macrophage datasets 35 ). SPI1 (PU.1) and POLR2AphosphoS5
binding sites were downloaded as broad ChIP-Seq peaks in BED format from the
Encode portal 78 37 (DCC:ENCSR037HRJ;
GEO:GSE30567; HL60 dataset) (see URLs).

BV2 mouse microglial cell line was kindly provided by Marc Diamond (UT
Southwestern Medical Center). BV2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11965)
supplemented with 5% FBS (Sigma F4135) and 100 U/ml
penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco 15140). Routine testing of cell lines using
MycoAlert PLUS mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza) showed that BV2 cells were
negative for mycoplasma contamination. pcDNA3-FLAG-PU.1 was a gift from
Christopher Vakoc 79 (Addgene
plasmid 66974). pGFP-V-RS with either non-targeting shRNA or PU.1-targeting
shRNAs was purchased from OriGene Technologies (TG502008). The pHrodo red
zymosan conjugate bioparticles from Thermo Fisher (P35364) were used to assess
phagocytic activity. For transient transfections, 200,000 cells were seeded in a
24-well plate. On the next day, cells were washed with PBS (Gibco 14190) and
medium was changed to 400 μl DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS
without antibiotic. Transfection mixes of 0.5 μg pcDNA3 or 0.5
μg pcDNA3-FLAG-PU.1 with 0.5 μg pCMV-GFP for overexpression of
mouse PU.1 and 1μg pGFP-V-RS-shSCR, -shA, -shB and -shD for knock-down
of mouse PU.1 were prepared with 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, incubated
for 20 min at room temperature and added to each well. After 8 hours of
incubation 1 ml of growth medium was added to each well and plates were
incubated for 2 days. Then the medium was replaced with 500 μl of fresh
medium, and 25 μg of bioparticles were added to cells for 3 hour
incubation. Bioparticles uptake was verified with a fluorescent microscope; then
the cells were collected with trypsin (Gibco #25200), washed with PBS
once and re-suspended in 500 μl PBS with 1% BSA. Cells were kept
on ice and phagocytic activity was analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). At least 30,000 events were collected in each experiment, gated on
FSC-A/SSC-A and further on FSC-A/FSC-W dot plot to analyze populations of viable
single cells. Data were quantified using FCS Express 5 (De Novo Software) and
GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Cells pretreated with 2 μM
Cytochalasin D for 30 minutes before and during the uptake of bioparticles were
used as a negative control. The population of
GFP + /pHrodo + cells in each condition
was used to quantify the phagocytic index: percentage of
pHrodo + cells in GFP + gated population
× geometric mean pHrodo intensity/10 6 ; and represented as
phagocytic activity. Three independent experiments were performed with two
technical replicates without randomization of sample processing, n = 3.
Researcher was not blinded to the samples identification. Differences between
the means of preselected groups were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and
Sidak’s post hoc multiple comparisons test between selected groups, with
a single pooled variance. Values of Cytochalasin D-treated cells were excluded
from the statistical analysis. Adjusted P values for each comparison are
reported, non-significant differences are not reported.

BV2 cells transiently transfected as described for the phagocytosis
assay were collected with trypsin after 48 hours of incubation, washed with PBS
and re-suspended in PBS with 1% BSA. Cells from the same treatment were
pooled and sorted on FACSARIA III (BD Biosciences) into GFP + and GFP − populations, pelleted at 2,000 rpm and lysed in RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and Complete protease inhibitor tablets
(Roche)) with one freeze-thaw cycle and 1 hour incubation on ice. Protein
concentration was quantified using the BCA kit (Thermo Fisher #23225).
Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis in Bolt 4 –
12% Bis-Tris Plus gels with MOPS SDS running buffer and transferred
using the iBlot 2 nitrocellulose transfer stack. Membranes were blocked and
probed with antibodies against PU.1 (Cell Signaling #2266) and
β-Actin (Sigma #A5441) in 3% non-fat dry milk in
TBS/0.1% Tween-20 buffer. Secondary antibody staining was visualized
using WesternBright ECL HRP Substrate Kit (Advansta K-12045) and ChemiDoc
XRS+ (BioRad). Images were quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and GraphPad
Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Two independent experiments were performed without
randomization of sample processing, n = 2. Researcher was not blinded to
the samples identification. Differences between every group mean were analyzed
with one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s post hoc multiple variance test between
selected groups, with a single pooled variance. Adjusted P values for each
comparison are reported.

Sorted GFP + BV2 cells after overexpression or
knock-down of PU.1 were collected as described for western blotting. Cell
pellets were lysed in QIAzol reagent and RNA was isolated with RNAeasy Mini kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen) including the
Dnase treatment step with RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Quantities of RNA were
measured using Nanodrop 8000 (Thermo Scientific) and reverse transcription was
performed with 1–2 μg of total RNA using High-Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed on QuantStudio 7
Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Power SYBR Green
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with one-step PCR protocol. 3 ng of cDNA was
used for all genes except Ms4a4a when 24 ng of cDNA was used in
a 10 μl reaction volume. Primers were from PrimerBank 80 or designed using Primer-BLAST
program (NCBI) and are listed in Supplementary Table 14 . Ct values were averaged from two
technical replicates for each gene. Geometric mean of average Ct for the
housekeeping genes GAPDH , B2M and ACTB was used as a reference that was subtracted from the
average Ct for a gene of interest (dCt). Gene expression levels were log
transformed (2 −dCt ) and related to the combined mean values
of pcDNA3 and pGFP-V-RS-shSCR control samples in each sort giving relative
expression for each gene of interest. Data were visualized in GraphPad Prism 7
(GraphPad Software). Four independent experiments were performed without
randomization of sample processing, n = 4. Researcher was not blinded to
the sample identity. Differences between means were analyzed using one-way ANOVA
and Dunnett’s post hoc multiple comparisons test between experimental
and control groups, with a single pooled variance. Adjusted P values for each
comparison are reported in Supplementary Table 13 .
