Prediction of cognition in Parkinson’s disease with a clinical-genetic score: a longitudinal analysis of nine cohorts

# Abstract
Cognitive decline is a debilitating manifestation of disease progression in Parkinson’s disease. We aimed to develop a clinical-genetic score to predict global cognitive impairment in patients with the disease. A prediction algorithm for global cognitive impairment (defined as Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) ≤25) was built using data from 1,350 patients with 5,165 longitudinal visits over 12.8 (median, 2.8) years. Age at onset, MMSE, education, motor exam score, gender, depression and GBA mutations, machine selected through stepwise Cox’ hazards analysis and Akaike’s information criterion, were used to compute the multivariable predictor. Independent validation was achieved in another 1,132 patients with 19,127 visits over 8.6 (median, 6.5) years. The cognitive risk score accurately predicted cognitive impairment within ten years of disease onset with an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.85 in both the discovery (95% CI, 0.821–0.902) and validation populations (95% CI, 0.779 – 0.913). 72.6% of patients scoring in the highest quartile were cognitively impaired by ten years vs. 3.7% in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 18.4, 95% CI, 9.4 – 36.1). Dementia or disabling cognitive impairment was predicted with an AUC of 0.877 (95% CI 0.788–0.943) and high negative predictive value (0.920, 95% 0.877–0.954) at the predefined cutoff (0.196). Performance was stable in 10,000 randomly resampled subsets. Our predictive algorithm provides a potential test for future cognitive health or impairment in patients with Parkinson’s. It could improve trials of cognitive interventions and inform on prognosis.

## Introduction
Cognitive decline is one of the most debilitating manifestations of disease progression in Parkinson’s and a key determinant of a patient’s quality of life and independence 1 . The ability to predict and manage this complication is highly relevant for recruitment and stratification of clinical trials, particularly those designed to slow disease progression and to prevent dementia. While a multitude of Parkinson’s medications is available to improve motor aspects of the disease, these do not have a major effect on cognitive decline.

Demographic and clinical risk factors for cognitive decline in PD are emerging. Age-at-onset 2 , 3 , depression 2 , and education 2 have been nominated as predictors of dementia in multiple small or medium-sized cohorts (e.g. the largest published study examined 400 subjects for several years) 2 , 3 . Measures of baseline disease severity using motor and cognitive scores are linked to an increased risk of developing future dementia 2 , 3 . Complementing these clinical clues, mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase gene ( GBA ; found in about 10% of patients with gene sequencing) are linked to accelerated cognitive decline in PD 4 , 5 . Other progression loci have been nominated, but remain controversial or await further replication in large, longitudinal studies (e.g. APOE , SNCA , MAPT ; reviewed in Ref. 6 ).

Here we develop a clinical-genetic score predictive of global cognitive impairment in a discovery set of 1,350 participants with PD followed in six longitudinal cohorts and validated in 1,132 participants from three independent longitudinal cohorts. The versatile cognitive risk calculator for PD ( http://scherzerlaboratory.org/tools/login.php ) can be used to calculate a patient’s risk estimate.

## Methods
Figure 1 shows a summary of our workflow. Table 1 describes the cohorts. Details are available in the appendix . 3,200 patients with PD were longitudinally assessed with 27,022 study visits in nine cohorts 2 , 7 – 13 from North America and Europe between 1986 and 2016 ( table 1 and appendix figure 1 ). 96.3% of study visits occurred within 12 years of follow-up with a median follow-up time of 6.4 years from disease onset (inter-quartile range, 4.6 years) ( appendix figure 2 ). We thus focused our primary analysis on the 12-year time frame from disease onset. Serial Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores 14 were longitudinally collected in seven cohorts. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 15 scores were collected in two cohorts and converted to MMSE scores according to a published formula 16 . To ensure consistency across studies, an MMSE score with the cutoff of ≤ 25 was defined as an indicator of significant global cognitive impairment as recommended by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Task Force 17 . Cohort-specific definitions of Parkinson’s disease dementia were used ( appendix table 1 ). The MDS-Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II and III scores were obtained from four cohorts, and estimated for the five remaining cohorts using the UPDRS or SPES/SCOPA-motor scales 18 based on published conversion formulas 19 , 20 ( table 1 ). Hoehn and Yahr scales (HY) 14 were longitudinally collected in all cohorts. Ethnicity was self-reported. GBA mutations were retrospectively genotyped and defined as in Ref. 4 . For several cohorts this analysis evaluated previously collected longitudinal phenotypic data; for the active HBS, PPMI, PDBP, DIGPD cohorts both retro- and prospectively collected longitudinal data elements were included. Because stratification of patients in clinical trials is a potential application of the prognosis score, we a priori assigned the two trial cohorts, DATATOP and PreCEPT, together with PPMI to the validation population ( figure 1 ). Written informed consent for each cohort was obtained from the participants under the supervision of each local ethics committee. The Institutional Review Board of Partners HealthCare approved the current analyses.

## Statistical Analysis
The discovery population was used to evaluate candidate clinical and GBA risk factors and to build the predictive score using a statistic similar to the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk score 21 . A step by step calculation of the score is included in the appendix table 4, figure 6 . Nine clinical and genetic risk factors previously associated with dementia in PD were considered for evaluation based on prior evidence 2 , 3 and applicability to our datasets: GBA mutation status, age at onset of PD, gender, years of education at baseline, baseline MMSE, MDS-UPDRS II, MDS-UPDRS III scores, Hoehn & Yahr stage, and baseline depression status. GBA was included because of unequivocal evidence from multiple, large longitudinal studies (e.g. 4 , 5 ). Other candidate progression loci are controversial and need further longitudinal replication 6 . The Cox proportional hazards statistic was used to estimate the influence of these risk factors on time (years from PD onset) to reaching the endpoint of global cognitive impairment (i.e., duration of diagnosed PD illness at point of cognitive impairment) during longitudinal follow-up in the discovery population. The Cox regression coefficients, which were incorporated into the cognitive predictive score, each index the hazard rate throughout the time period analyzed, which is assumed to be constant throughout that period. This “proportional hazard assumption” was valid for all predictors except the MDS-UPDRS II, which was discarded for this reason. The eight remaining risk factors were entered into a multivariable Cox model. Backward elimination was performed to remove uninformative variables from the model based on the lowest Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). Hoehn & Yahr stage was eliminated from the model during this process (AIC of 2,088.2 without HY vs. 2,089.5 with HY). The final multivariable Cox regression model then included the remaining seven risk factors ( figure 1 ). To adjust for differences among the seven cohorts, a “cohort” term was included as a random effect (using a “frailty” Cox model). The score was then validated in 1,132 patients with 19,127 follow-up visits over 8.6 (median, 6.5; IQR 3.1) years. Cochran’s Q-test and the I 2 index were used to test for heterogeneity across studies ( appendix table 2 ). In all analyses, p values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Dementia is characterized as a loss of cognitive ability s evere enough to interfere with normal activities of daily living 17 . We conservatively tested dementia prediction in individuals with PD (without cognitive impairment at enrollment) in the validation population that was not used to build the predictive score. 1,132 patients with 19,127 longitudinal study visits were available for this analysis.

To test the stability of the predictive score we rebuilt and retested the score in 10,000 training and test sets randomly generated from the entire study population.

To evaluate longitudinal trajectories of serial MMSE and MoCA scores in patients with high (> 0.196) vs. low cognitive predictive scores (≤ 0.196) at enrollment, we performed LMM adjusting for disease duration at enrollment using appropriate cohorts from the validation population.

Detailed methods, statistical analyses, supplemental results, and illustrative case studies are shown in the appendix .

## Results
3,200 patients with PD from nine cohorts were screened for eligibility. 235 patients were excluded because of a MMSE ≤ 25 at baseline; 135 were excluded because their first study visit occurred more than 12 years from disease onset. Six cohorts representing 1,350 patients (after exclusion of an additional 334 patients with missing covariates) with 5,165 longitudinal visits over 12.8 (median, 2.8; interquartile range (IQR) 3.1) years) were assigned to the discovery population ( figure 1 ): HBS, CamPaIGN, PICNICS, PROPARK, DIGPD and PDBP. The proportional variance in the cognitive predictive scores accounted for by the model as a whole was 97.4%. Each of the seven predictors included into the model significantly contributed to the information content of the score. Age at PD onset was responsible for 56.5% of the variance, followed by MMSE at enrollment (7.7%), years of education (5.4%), MDS-UPDRS part III score at enrollment (4.7%), gender (2.6%), depression at enrollment (1.9%), and GBA carrier status (1.5%).

Our cognitive risk score showed high accuracy (quantified by AUC estimates) for predicting, whether a patient will develop global cognitive impairment within ten years from disease onset. In the discovery population, the AUC was 0.863 (95% CI 0.821–0.901; figure 2A ); with a specificity of 0.717 (95%CI 0.652–0.775) and a sensitivity of 0.865 (95%CI 0.802–0.918) at the optimal cutoff (0.196). Patients with cognitive predictive scores in the highest (fourth) quartile had a dramatically increased hazard ratio (HR) for global cognitive impairment of 21.6 (95% CI, 10.9 – 42.9) compared to those in the lowest risk quartile (the reference quartile; p < 0.0001, table 2 ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves of subjects in the highest and lowest risk quartiles, respectively ( figure 2C ), revealed that 95.8% (95% CI 92.7%–99.1%) of patients in the lowest quartile of predictive scores survived for ten years without global cognitive impairment in contrast to only 34.9% (95% CI 26.5%–46.2%) in the highest quartile (a 60.9% difference; p < 0.0001 log-rank test; figure 2C ).

The score built in the discovery study (consisting of the seven predictors and β coefficients from the discovery study) was locked-in and applied “as is” to the new patients. Similarly, the quartile ranges and the optimal cutoff identified in the discovery study were rigorously applied to the validation population. The predictive score was accurate in the validation population with an AUC of 0.854 (95% CI 0.779–0.913) ( figure 2B ). Specificity was 0.744 (95% CI 0.604–0.868) and sensitivity was 0.733 (95% CI 0.617–0.831) at the pre-set cutoff of a score of 0.196. Adjusting for a 26.7% prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment in non-demented patients with PD patients 22 yielded a negative predictive value of 0.884 (95% CI 0.818–0.923) with a positive predictive value of 0.510 (95% CI 0.400–0.639). Patients with predictive scores in the highest (fourth) quartile had a substantially increased HR for global cognitive impairment of 18.4 (95% CI, 9.4 – 36.1) compared to those in the lowest risk quartile ( table 2 ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves of subjects in the highest and lowest quartile of predictive scores, respectively, in the validation population are shown in figure 2D . 96.3% (95% CI 94.1% – 98.6%) of patients in the lowest quartile of predictive scores survived for ten years without global cognitive impairment while only 27.4% (95% CI 12.6%–59.8%) of patients in the highest quartile of predictive scores survived for ten years without global cognitive impairment in the validation population (a 68.9% difference; p < 0.0001 log-rank test; figure 2D ).

Cohort-specific definitions of a clinical diagnosis of PD dementia (PDD) were employed as described in the Methods. The AUC for predicting dementia within ten years from onset was 0.877 (95% CI 0.788–0.943) — even higher than for global cognitive decline ( figure 3 ). At the cutoff of 0.196, dementia was predicted with a sensitivity of 0.861 (95% CI 0.716–0.944) and specificity of 0.721 (95% CI 0.594–0.841). The negative predictive values for dementia ranged from 0.920 (95% 0.877–0.954) to 0.941 (95% CI 0.919 – 0.961) based on systematic estimates of prevalence of dementia amongst patients with PD ranging from 31.1% (high quality studies) 23 to 24.5% (all studies) 23 . Patients with predictive scores in the highest (fourth) quartile had a substantially increased HR for dementia of 21.9 (95% CI, 6.5 – 73.1) compared to those scoring in the lowest quartile ( table 3 ). 98.9 (95% CI 97.6% – 99.9%) of patients in the lowest quartile of predictive scores survived for ten years without dementia while only 48.3% (95% CI 21.3%–62.8%) of patients in the highest quartile of predictive scores survived for ten years without dementia (a 50.6% difference; p < 0.0001 log-rank test).

In 10,000 iterations, age at onset, enrollment MMSE score, and years of education remained in the model after stepwise pruning in 100% of iterations, enrollment MDS-UPDRS III in 98.30%, GBA carrier status in 91.79%, depression in 90.61%, and gender in 78.52% ( figure 4A ). HY stage (which did not make it into our clinical-genetic score) was added to the model in 34.86% of iterations. Across 10,000 re-sampled test sets, the mean AUC was 0.833 (95% CI, 0.785–0.876) consistent with stable performance. Moreover, the score stably and accurately predicted dementia across the 10,000 re-sampled training and test sets with an average training AUC of 0.879 (95% CI 0.837–0.916) and an average testing AUC of 0.872 (95% CI 0.817–0.920) ( figure 4B ).

PD patients with high enrollment predictive scores had a significantly more rapid longitudinal decline in MMSE scores over time with p < 0.0001 compared to the patients with low enrollment predictive scores ( figure 5A ). The MoCA test may be more sensitive than the MMSE for detecting cognitive change in patients with PD 15 . We analyzed the longitudinal trajectories of MoCA scores in PPMI and PreCEPT, two of the validation cohorts, which have included this scale into their assessment battery. Patients with high predictive scores at enrollment had a much steeper decline in MoCA scores over time compared to patients with low predictive scores with p < 0.0001 ( figure 5B ).

We performed a power analysis to estimate sample size requirements for a three-year clinical trial of a hypothetical drug designed to halt cognitive decline (as measured by serial MoCA or MMSE, respectively) in a trial of patients predicted to be at high risk of cognitive decline based on an enrollment cognitive risk scores at or above the cutoff of 0.196. Sample sizes of 137 (152) per placebo and 137 (152) per drug group were sufficient in order to yield 80% power for serial MoCA (or MMSE assessments). By contrast, if instead unselected patients with PD were enrolled to test the same experimental drug (over the same time period, assuming the same α, same standard deviation, and same test-retest correlations), 801 (802) patients would need be enrolled for each of the active treatment and placebo arms to achieve 80% power for serial MoCA (or MMSE assessments) ( figure 5C ). Detailed methods and two illustrative case studies are shown in the appendix . Medications inhibiting acetylcholine esterase activity (AChE) can be used to enhance cognitive function in patients with PD and could conceivably inflate MMSE scores. However, we found no statistically significant influence of AChE inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil and galantamine) on MMSE scores in the three cohorts with pertinent medication information (PPMI, PDBP, HBS), neither at enrollment nor during longitudinal follow-up.

For longitudinal analyses, examining the performance and stability of the prediction accuracy for various time frames (not just the ten-year time frame) using time-dependent ROC curves is of interest. For our score, the time-dependent prediction accuracy (as measured by the incident/dynamic average iAUC 24 ) was stable at various time points (from 1 to 11 years from disease onset; appendix figure 4 ). It somewhat degraded during year 12, likely due to the relatively low number of patients who completed 12 years of follow-up.

Collectively, the clinical-genetic cognitive predictive score was robustly associated with both binary and continuous longitudinal cognitive outcomes, including global cognitive impairment, level 1 dementia, and decline in MMSE and MoCA scores over time.

In settings where GBA genotyping is not easily obtained, a version of the score comprising only the six clinical features (without GBA ) could be used. This clinical score was informative and predicted global cognitive decline with high accuracy in both the discovery population with an AUC of 0.859 (95% CI, 0.816 – 0.898) and the validation population with an AUC of 0.827 (95% CI, 0.741 – 0.893) ( appendix figure 5A, B ). However, in a head-to-head comparison with the clinical-genetic score, the prediction accuracy of the clinical-only score significantly underperformed (p < 0.0001; appendix figure 5E ).

## Discussion
We have developed and replicated a cognitive risk score in 2,830 patients with PD and 25,069 longitudinal clinical assessments. The area under the curve for accurately predicting global cognitive impairment within ten years of disease onset was greater than 85% in both the discovery and validation populations (with 95% CIs of 0.821–0.902 and 0.779 – 0.913, respectively). The AUC for predicting development of dementia within ten years from disease onset was 87.7% (95% CI, 0.788 – 0.943) in the validation population. The cognitive risk score was associated with the binary outcomes of future cognitive impairment and dementia as well as continuous longitudinal measures such as a steeper decline in MMSE and MoCA scores tracked over time.

In addition to the clinical-genetic risk factors here evaluated, reduced levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid have been linked to dementia in PD 25 and this is supported by neuroimaging studies with Amyloid PET 26 . The predictive score is non-invasive, without the risks associated with lumbar puncture and without the restricted availability of PET imaging. The clinical-genetic version can be implemented in any setting with access to a certified gene testing lab. The clinical variables-only version can be nearly universally deployed.

The prediction algorithm developed has strengths. It was built starting from a small set of variables linked to cognitive decline or dementia in PD by prior evidence. This enhances the validity of the variables in the score. The parameters were winnowed down through machine learning. The predictor was built (as well as tested) in longitudinal cohorts, a superior study design compared to time-static, cross-sectional studies. The cohorts included vary in their design, recruitment, and assessments. PICNICS, CamPaIGN, and PROPARK are population-based cohorts designed to represent a community. HBS, PDBP, and PPMI are biomarkers cohorts. DATATOP and PreCEPT are clinical trial cohorts. These cohorts are not representative of the PD patient population as a whole, however, they are similar to “typical” clinical trial populations in the US. The fact that the score was informative across these varying cohorts is a testament to its robustness. It should be usable for other similar cohorts and most importantly, trial populations.

The score has the potential to facilitate clinical trials of experimental treatments designed to ameliorate or slow cognitive decline. Therapeutic trials in PD are hampered by the highly varied rate of progression to clinical endpoints. Because some participants with PD on placebo will experience minimal decline in cognition, it is difficult to demonstrate a therapeutic effect of the experimental therapeutic over a reasonable sample size and time course. The prognostic score represents a simple tool for stratifying and enriching the trial with patients most prone to rapid cognitive decline. Therapeutics that arrest or slow down the cognitive decline leading to dementia (which can be taken as a surrogate marker of advancing pathology) are likely to be disease modifying. Our power analysis estimated that recruiting patients with high cognitive risk scores >0.196 into such a trial will reduce the required samples size by as much as 6-fold ( figure 5C ). Our model should translate into more cost-effective trials, allow for “more shots on target”, and increase chances of success.

Our cognitive predictive score yields substantial negative predictive values of 88.4% for cognitive impairment and 92.0% for dementia within ten years from disease onset, but it is not yet ready for use in routine clinical care. A necessary next step towards use in clinical care will be a large prospective study using a neuropsychological test battery. If further confirmed, a low score could be reassuring for some patients and their families and inform planning decisions. On the other hand, a high score, while beneficial for enriching a research trial population, has a limited positive predictive value for a specific patient (in part due to the modest prevalence of cognitive impairment in the general PD population). It is as yet unknown, whether modification of any of the risk factors comprising the score will impact on cognitive outcome. This raises difficult ethical questions similar to issues surrounding ApoE4 testing in mild cognitive impairment 27 . Education is per definition modifiable, but no ready made interventions have been delineated for PD. Trials of GBA -directed therapeutics are just beginning. As with any medical advance pushing beyond current practice paradigms, the appropriate medical and ethical framework for considering the cognitive predictive score in practice settings will have to be carefully outlined.

In the DATATOP and PreCEPT cohorts, DNA was collected several years after enrollment for a subset of participants 9 . They may underrepresent patients with more rapidly progressive disease, but it is unlikely that this would yield a spurious association between the cognitive predictive score and cognitive decline. The Cochran’s Q-test for heterogeneity of effects across cohorts indicated that any differences in disease progression between studies (due to sampling or selection effects) should not bias the test. We found no evidence that memory enhancing medications or drop outs materially influenced the results of this study.

The frequency of global cognitive impairment (within ten years from disease onset) among patients with PD in the discovery and validation populations was consistent, 24.7% and 26.0%, respectively, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. These estimates are in keeping with reported prevalence estimates, ranging from 18.9% 28 to 57.1% for mild cognitive impairment 29 and from 8.3% to 41% for dementia among patients with PD (reviewed in 23 ). Furthermore, natural history studies have attempted to capture the frequency of cognitive impairment in PD, but due to major design differences, the range of estimates is wide, from 26% 2 to as high as 83% among twenty-year survivors 30 . A definite view has not crystallized due to small sample sizes, variable follow-up lengths, and fundamental differences in the analytical methods.

Going forward, we plan to refine the score and extend its applications. Ongoing efforts to map the genomes and epigenomes of Parkinson’s patients should discover new predictors. Such data can, in theory, be seamlessly integrated into the versatile prediction tool we have here developed. We believe that in the near future, data-driven prediction will inspire a new proactive and preventive approach to PD.
