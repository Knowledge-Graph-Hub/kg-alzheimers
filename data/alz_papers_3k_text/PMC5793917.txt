# Title
Cytosolic Proteostasis via Importing of Misfolded Proteins into Mitochondria

# Abstract
Loss of proteostasis underlies aging and neurodegeneration characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction 1 – 5 . Although many neurodegenerative-disease proteins can be found in mitochondria 4 , 6 , it remains unclear how these disease manifestations may be related. In yeast, protein aggregates formed under stress or during aging are preferentially retained by the mother cell in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps dissociate aggregates to enable refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins 7 – 10 . Here we show that in yeast cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates formed under heat shock (HS) contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after HS, while some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not the proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC ( m itochondria a s g uardian i n c ytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells.

Tdp43 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Jiou Wang’s lab (Johns Hopkins University). Most of the expression plasmids were constructed based on the p404 backbone 33 . The verification of MudPIT hits was done with the strains from the yeast GFP library 34 . Split-GFP system’s DNA fragments were synthesized by gBlocks (Cabantous et al., 2005). GFP1-10 was in frame with mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS) and mCherry. GFP 11 replaced GFP in pFA6a-GFP (S65T)-His3MX6 to serve as the universal C-terminal tagging plasmid. APEX2 was in frame with MTS-GFP. For SIM assay, mitochondrial outer membrane was labeled with mCherry-Fis1TM 35 ; GFP 1-10 was fused with the mitochondrial matrix protein Grx5 (Grx5- GFP 1-10 ); the native aggregate protein Lsg1 was tagged with GFP 11 . For mammalian plasmids, MTS-mCherry-GFP1-10 replaced the DsRed in pDsRed-Monomer-Hyg-N1 vector; GST-HA-GFP 11 , FlucWT-HA-GFP 11 , FlucSM-HA-GFP 11 or FlucDM-HA-GFP 11 replaced the GFP in pAcGFP1-N1 vector, respectively.

Live-cell images of yeast were acquired using either a Yokagawa (Tokyo, Japan) CSU-10 spinning disc on the side port of a Carl Zeiss (Jena, Germany) 200m inverted microscope or Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA) Ultraview VoX system equipped with Zeiss Definite Focus, or a Carl Zeiss LSM-510 Confocor 3 system. 488/561 nm excitation was used to excite GFP/RFPs, and emission was collected through the appropriate filters onto a Hamamatsu C9100-13 EMCCD on the spinning disc systems or the single photon avalanche photodiodes on the Confocor 3. All GFP images were acquired through a 500–550 nm filter. RFP images were acquired with a 580 nm long pass filter on the CSU-10, and a 420–475/502–544/582–618/663–691 multiband filter on the Ultraview. All images were acquired in a multi-track, alternating excitation configuration so as to avoid GFP bleed through. The CSU-10 and Ultraview systems utilized a 100× 1.45 NA Plan-Apochromat objective. Images were acquired using MetaMorph (version 7.0; MDS Analytical Technologies) on CSU-10 spinning disc system, Volocity 6.3 (Perkin Elmer) on Ultraview system and Carl Zeiss AIM software for the LSM 510. Mammalian cell images were acquired using Zeiss LSM780 confocal (Jena, Germany) with 40X/1.4 oil Plan-Apochromat objective.

Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete (SC) or drop-out media containing 2% dextrose overnight at 30 °C (23 °C for ts mutants). The 4 ml (or 8 ml for recovery assays) mid-log culture with OD 600 of roughly 0.5 was transferred to 42 °C to be heat-shocked for 30 min. For 3D fluorescence time-lapse imaging, cells were placed on a thin SC (2% dextrose) agarose gel pad to allow for prolonged imaging at room temperature 36 . 3D image stacks were acquired every minute for 60–90 min. Each z-series was acquired with 0.5-micron step size. All image processing was performed using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For visualization purposes, images in the figure were scaled with bilinear interpolation.

Cycloheximide (C4859, Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Hydrogen peroxide solution (216763, Sigma) was diluted 10 times in H 2 O and added to a final concentration of 0.7 mM at 30 °C to induce protein aggregation. CCCP (C2759, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO or ethanol to 20 mM as stock and 25μM was used to treat cells. MG132 (c2211, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and 80 μM was used to treat cells. PMSF (P7626, Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and 1 mM was used to treat cells. DHE staining was done by incubating cells with 180 μM DHE (D11347, Invitrogen) for 10min at room temperature. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM, T5428, Sigma) was added to a final concentration 1 μM for 30 minutes at 30 °C. Anti-HA-Peroxidase in APEX assay was from Sigma (12013819001). HA-Tag (C29F4) Rabbit mAb #3724 from Cell Signaling Technique was used in all the other immunoblots. Anti-GFP was from MBL International Corporation (#598). Guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma G3272) 3 mM was added during heat shock. Anti-Tom70 antibody, anti-Dld1 antibody and anti-Abf2 antibody were kindly provided by Steven Claypool’s lab (Johns Hopkins University).

Aggregate dissolution assays were done as described previously 37 . Briefly, yeast cells were heat shocked at 42 °C for 30 min and recovered for 15min at 30 °C or 23 °C (for ts mutants) with or without additional drug such as CHX or CCCP before mounted on an agarose gel-pad slide for 3D time-lapse imaging. The major technical flow is as follows: after generating masks of the aggregates, cell areas and cytoplasm were created and used to calculate the average intensity of aggregate regions (including cytosolic background), average cytosolic intensity, and total aggregates area. The average cytosolic intensity was subtracted from the average aggregate region intensity to obtain the corrected average aggregate intensity without cytosolic background. Finally, the total aggregate intensity was calculated by multiplying the corrected average aggregates intensity by the aggregate area and normalized to the initial intensity for comparison between strains or conditions. Aggregate intensities were measured starting at 30 minutes after the start of acquisition because during the early part of the movies aggregates grew in intensity as explained in detail previously 37 .

FRET measurement of cellular ATP level was performed by using the acceptor photobleaching method as described previously 35 . Briefly, yeast cells expressing AT1.03 38 were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 min and recovered with or without indicated compounds for 0 min, 30 min or 60 min. Cells were then immobilized on a glass slide and imaged using a Perkin-Elmer Ultraview spinning disc system with a CSU-X1 Yokogawa disc. A 100X 1.4 NA Plan-apochromatic objective was used, and emission was collected onto a C9100 Hamamatsu Photonics EM-CCD. CFP was excited with a 440 nm laser, and emission was collected through a 456–484 nm band pass filter. All FRET efficiency was normalized to the mean of CHX treated group.

240 mL yeast culture (FlucSM-GFP or FlucSM-GFP-3xFlag) with OD around 0.5 were heat shocked in 42 °C water bath or treated with 0.7 mM H 2 O 2 for desired period of time. After HS or H 2 O 2 , CHX and CCCP were added to prevent aggregate formation and dissolution. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 2 min and the pellet was washed once with water, re-suspended in 1mL 10 mM DTT (100 mM Tris-H 2 SO 4 , PH 9.3) for 5min at 30 °C. Then the cells were washed once with sorbitol buffer (20 mM K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 , PH 7.5, 1.2 M Sorbitol), followed by 5 min digestion with 0.7 mg/mL zymolase100T (US biological) in 1 mL zymolyase buffer. Zymolyase was removed by centrifugation (800 g) and cells were washed twice with zymolyase buffer. Cells were lysed with 800 μl ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES PH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (roche #11836170001) and 10 U/mL RNasin plus RNase Inhibitor (N2611) by pipetting 15–20 times on ice. 2min centrifugation at 800 g was followed by 1min 6,000 g centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was carefully transferred to the top of sucrose gradient consisting of 650 μl 50%, 2 mL 20% and 1 mL 10% sucrose dissolved in the lysis buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 16 min. 18-gauge needles were used to insert into 20% sucrose fraction from the side of centrifuge tube to collect about 900 μl 20% sucrose fraction. The entire 900 μl 20% fraction was directly applied to the column prefilled with about 600 μl M2 resin (A2220, sigma) prepared in cold room according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The column was then washed 20 times with 1 mL cold wash buffer (1xTBS contain 10 U/mL RNasin plus). Then the beads were carefully transferred into a new 2 mL tube, gently inverted 10–15 times and left on rack for about 5 min-10 min to separate beads from wash buffer. The supernatant was replaced with fresh wash buffer. The beads were then loaded back to column and incubated with 650 μl of 1xTBS supplemented with 2% SDS for 5 min on bench before elution. To examine Tom70 and Tom40 in the purified aggregates, we engineered HA tag to the C-termini of Tom40, Tom70, Om45, Mdm10 and Mdm34, respectively, in FlucSM-GFP-3xFlag background; Tom40 and Tom70 in FlucSM-GFP background. Similar amounts of aggregates purified from 7 different strains were used to detect Tom70 and Tom40.

TCA-precipitated proteins were urea-denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche) followed by modified trypsin (Promega) 39 , 40 . Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 250 μm fused silica microcapillary columns packed with strong cation exchange resin (Luna, Phenomenex) and 5 μm C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), and then connected to a 100 μm fused silica microcapillary column packed with 5 μm C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex) 39 . Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoScientific, San Jose, CA). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides, as described in (Florens and Washburn, 2006). Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST 41 against a database consisting of 6019 nonredundant yeast proteins (NCBI, 2013-02-26 release), 160 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes). To estimate false discovery rates (FDR)s, the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein entry was randomized to generate a virtual library. This resulted in a total library of 12038 non-redundant sequences against which the spectra were matched. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect 42 with the following criteria set: Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.0 for doubly-, and 3.0 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least 7 amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least 2 such peptides, or 1 peptide with 2 spectra. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST 42 . To estimate relative protein levels, distributed Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (dNSAFs) were calculated for each detected protein/protein group, as described 43 . Table S1 and S2 were generated by filtering the hits with stringent cutoff (FDR<0.05 and were identified in 3 out of 4 repeats for 30 min HS, 2 out of 2 repeats for other samples). The average dNSAF was used to calculate percentage of aggregate proteins identified in each condition. The aggregate proteins that can be found in a previous published mitochondrial proteome 44 were included to calculate the percentage of mitochondrial protein in 30min HS sample.

Human RPE1 (ATCC CRL4000) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) (GIBCO®), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine® 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. RPE1 cells were double transfected with MTS-mCherry-GFP1-10 and protein of interest that tagged with GFP 11 (2.5μg of each plasmid were applied). After 24 hours of transfection, each sample was equally divided into a new plate and a MatTek (P35G-0-14-C) dish, for western blot and imaging after another 24 hours, respectively. The cell line has been tested as mycoplasma negative.

In yeast, protein of interest was tagged with GFP 11 at C terminus of its genomic locus in the strain that carries MTS-mCherry-GFP 1-10 . Yeast cells were grown and imaged as described above. HS was performed at 42 °C in 4 ml culture for 30 min with shaking of 220 rpm. 1 ml of yeast culture was directly taken out and imaged after HS. Post HS cultures were shaking with 220 rpm at 30 °C when indicated time points were acquired (with new medium were added to the culture to keep the OD600 below 0.5 all the time). For CCCP treatment, log phase yeast was treated with 25 μM CCCP at 30 °C for 15 min. For CHX treatment, log phase yeast was treated with 100 μg/ml CHX at 30 °C for 30 min. All the images were acquired with same laser and exposure setting. RPE1 cells were double transfected with Split-GFP constructs as described above. Cells were located using mCherry channel only.

Quantification of split-GFP fluorescence was done using a custom python code, which can be found within the git repository located at https://github.com/RongLiLab/image_analysis_and_quantification/blob/master/Ruan_Zhou_2016_zstack_analysis.py . Briefly, after reading the mCherry and GFP channel z-stacks, the intensities were summed along the z-axis. The resulting 2D image in the GFP channel was then subject to the random walk segmentation in order to segment out the yeast cells from background and watershed segmentation to separate adjacent cells. The segmentation algorithms were taken from the scikit-image library. Following the segmentation, the median GFP and mCherry intensity in each cell was calculated. Cells whose median GFP is significantly superior to the five cells with lowest GFP in the image are eliminated from further analysis, since they correspond to auto-fluorescence of dying cells. For each cell, mCherry channel was thresholded at 5% of maximal value in order to detect the mitochondria, and median GFP intensity within mitochondria was calculated. This median GFP intensity and mCherry intensity were used in the following analyses.

For yeast quantification of fraction of cells that had the split-GFP signal, all images were acquired with same microscopy setting. Different time points of each sample were set with the same minimum and maximum display value. Maximal z-projection images were used to count the number of total cell and cells with distinct split-GFP that co-localize with mitochondria mCherry. At least 9 fields from 3 different experiments were quantified at each time point. Worth noting is that, when using cells recovered from frozen glycerol stocks, about 5% of yeast in FlucSM-GFP 11 showed nuclear GFP signal, but not mCherry signal. Those cells were eliminated from quantification in both cell counting and GFP/mCherry intensity ratio quantification.

Quantification was done with another custom analysis pipeline and the python code can be found within the git repository located at https://github.com/RongLiLab/image_analysis_and_quantification/blob/master/Ruan_Zhou_2016_zstack_analysis.py . Global Otsu threshold is then applied to the maximum projection of mCherry channel to identify the locations of the mitochondria and the resulting binary mask is then segmented to determine projections of individual mitochondria. Following that, each binary label corresponding to an individual mitochondrion is skeletonized by morphological thinning in order to qualify its morphological structure (circular fragments of mitochondria v.s. elongated mitochondria). Following this, for every binary label, the length of the skeleton and total area covered is computed and used as a basis to classify the region it spans as either intact mitochondria or fragmented mitochondria. Skeleton longer than 20 pixels and total area larger than 25 pixels were used as cutoff for intact mitochondria.

GFP-APEX2 was cloned from a plasmid from Dr. Alice Y. Ting lab (MIT, Massachusetts) and the following protocol was derived from the original protocol for mammalian cell culture 45 . MTS-GFP-APEX2 was introduced into the TRP1 locus of the strains expressing HA-tagged cytosolic proteins identified in aggregates. 4 mL of the mid-log culture was heat-shocked for 30 min at 42°C. The cell wall was reduced by incubating with 10 mM DTT (pH 9.5) for 5 min and cells were washed with zymolyase buffer (pH 7.5, 0.6 M sorbitol, 150 mM NaCl). After re-suspending the cells in zymolyase buffer, zymolyase (0.2 mg/mL), saponin (0.5 mg/mL) and biotin-phenol (BP) (500 μM) were added for 10 min to remove the cell wall and permeabilize plasma membrane to allow BP to access mitochondria. The completion of cell permeablization was verified microscopically. H 2 O 2 (1 mM) was added for 1 min to activate biotinylation of mitochondrial proteomeby APEX2. Cells were then washed three times with reducing buffer (10 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox and 10 mM sodium azide in zymolyase buffer) to stop biotinylation and remove free BP. In this step, the pellet fraction containing organelles, including mitochondria, was separated from cytosolic proteins by centrifugation. After re-suspending the organelles in 100 μl zymolyase buffer, 1 mL cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton x100 and 1x protein inhibitor (04693159001 ROCHE)) was added to lyse the cells for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,500 g, the lysate was incubated 30 min at room temperature with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads® M-280, 11205D) prepared according to manufacturer’s instruction and washed 5×5 min with PBS supplemented with 0.1% tween-20 and 1 mg/mL BSA. The biotinylated proteins were released from beads by incubating with sample buffer (1x NuPAGE sample buffer (NP0007) supplemented with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM D-biotin) for 10 min at 95 °C.

Mitochondria purification was based on a previous protocol 46 . Briefly, yeast cells expressing MTS-mCherry (in wt and tim23 ts background) were cultured in 10 liter lactate medium (3 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L CaCl 2 -H 2 0, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 0.6 g/L MgCl 2 -6H 2 0, 1 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 1 g/L NH 4 Cl, 22 ml/L 90% Lactic acid, adjust to PH 5.5 with NaOH) to OD 600 of 1. Cells were collected by centrifugation and treated with Tris-DTT buffer (0.1 M Tris, 10 mM DTT, adjust PH to 9.4). After washing with SP buffer (1.2 M Sorbital, 20 mM KPi, pH7.4), cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml zymolase100T (US biological) at 30 °C for 40 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted, washed with the SP buffer, and then resuspended in regeneration buffer (1.2 M Sorbitol, 1 x Lactate media without glucose) in order to isolate robust mitochondria. For the protease protection assay, regeneration step was skipped. Spheroplasts were then washed with the SEH buffer (0.6M Sorbital, 20 mM HEPES-KOH of pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EGTA of pH8.0, protease cocktail (P2714, Sigma), 10 μM Benzamidine-HCl (B6506), 1 μg/ml 1,10-Phenanthroline (P9375), PMSF 1 mM was added before use) and broken with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 g (low-speed) for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 g (high-speed) for 10 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated with resuspending the first low-speed pellet and breaking it with Dounce again. The homogenate was centrifuged with low-speed and high-speed as described above. The high-speed pellet was collected and the Dounce homogenization was repeated with a loose-fitting pestle. The final high-speed pellet contained the crude mitochondria was carefully transferred to a Nycodenz gradient in Beckman 14 × 89 mm Ultra-Clear Centrifuge tubes (344059). The gradient consisted of 2.1 ml 25%, 2.1 ml 20%, 2.1 ml 15%, 2.1 ml 10%, and 2.1 ml 5% Nycodenz from bottom to top. The gradient was ultracentrifuged in a Swinging bucket rotor (Beckman SW41 rotor) for 60 min at 4 °C with speed at 30,000 rpm. Mitochondria were concentrated around 16% Nycodenz and appeared as a wide red-brownish band in the fourth layer counting from the top.

Aggregates were purified based on the method described above but with two changes. First, the strains used here (both wt and hsp104 deletion background) expressed FlucSM-HA-GFP-3xFlag-3xFKBP-Myc. The motif 3xFKBP was originally included because we thought induced binding may be necessary for import of aggregate proteins in vitro, but we found that aggregates naturally bind mitochondria without any artificial method needed ( Extended Data Fig. 3c ). Second, we used the crude aggregate fraction from the sucrose gradient without the affinity purification in order to obtain sufficient free aggregates for the in vitro import assay. The mitochondria import assay in vitro was detailed described previously 47 . Briefly, purified mitochondria 10 mg/ml were pre-treated with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P2714, Cell Signaling Technology 5872S) for 15 min and mixed with aggregates in import buffer (3% w/v Fatty acid-free BSA, 250 mM Sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH7.2, 10 μM ATP). We note that the ATP requirement in our assay was much lower than that in previous work 48 , 49 . This could be due to possible ATP production by the mitochondria in the assay, leading to increased ATP levels that are sufficient to support Hsp104 activity, or due to a different mechanistic action of Hsp104 in our assay system. The aggregate to mitochondria volume ratio was 1:10 (3 μl 125 μg/ml aggregates from sucrose gradient to 30 μl 10 mg/ml mitochondria). Aggregates concentration was measured and adjusted by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific #23225) and confirmed by imaging of GFP labeled FlucSM puncta’s density. Same amount of mixture was taken out at indicated time points up to 1.5 hour and boiled 15 min in SDS sample buffer for immune blot analysis.

Mitochondria from the strain expressing FlucSM-HA were purified based on above protocol in “ Mitochondrial isolation and in vitro import assay” , after heat shock at 42°C. The only difference was no regeneration step after inducing spheroplasts. Purified mitochondria was washed 3 time with import buffer without ATP (3% w/v Fatty acid-free BSA, 250 mM Sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH7.2) to get rid of protease inhibitor. Then the mitochondria were spin down in 4°C 13000rpm for 10 minutes. Mitochondria were resuspended and same amount was added to 4 different 1.5 ml tubes. Group 1 without any treatment as total mitochondria. Group 2 was treated with Trypsin for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) continued with protease K treatment for another 1 hour at RT to assess the protection by mitochondrial outer membrane. Group 3 was added with digitonin to permeabilize outer membrane and Group 4 was added with both digitonin and Triton-X100 to permeabilize inner membrane. Then group 3 and 4 underwent same proteases treatment as Group 2. The volume difference was equalized with SEH buffer. Immediately after the treatment, all the samples were added with PMSF and boiled 15 minutes in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis.

Log phase yeast expressing FlucSM-HA in TIM23 and tim23 ts backgrounds, expressing FlucSM-HA or Lsg1-HA in Δpdr5 background were heat-shocked at 42°C for 30 minutes. Recovery at 30 °C (23 °C for tim23 ts groups) was performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml CHX and indicated drugs (50 μM CCCP, 1 mM PMSF, 80 μM MG132). At indicated time points, same amount of yeast cells were collected and lysed followed by 15 minutes boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis.

3 single colonies of both wild type cells and pim1 S1015A : PIM1 cells were inoculated in YPD and YPG (YP plus glycerol) at 30 °C overnight. The cultures were then diluted to same OD of 0.075 to refresh for 3 hours at 30 °C in order to enter log phase. Then the OD adjusted wild type cells and pim1 S1015A : PIM1 cells were plated on YPD and YPG plates. Cells were spotted at 10x serial dilutions from left to right and cultured in 30 °C incubator for 44 hours on YPD plate and 60 hours on YPG plate before scanning.

Mitochondrial outer membrane was labeled with mCherry-Fis1TM. GFP1-10 was fused with the mitochondrial matrix protein Grx5 (Grx5-GFP1-10). The native aggregate protein Lsg1 was tagged with GFP11. After 30 min heat shock at 42 °C, the split GFP signal was imaged with mitochondria by using the Nikon structured illumination microscope (Nikon, N-SIM) with the 100x TIRF objective. 3D reconstruction was done using the Elements N-SIM software.

Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 6.0. For the yeast cell data, unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine significant differences between samples. For the mammalian cell imaging data, Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (nonparametric distribution) was used to determine significant differences between samples; for the mammalian cell immunoblot results, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test nonparametric distribution) was used to determine significant differences between samples (significance levels: (*) for p < 0.05, (**) for p < 0.01, (***) for p < 0.001).

Loading control: GAPDH. g , Working model of MAGIC. Cytosolic aggregates are attached to mitochondria through interaction with import receptors such as Tom70. Individual aggregate proteins, which may be dissociated from aggregates by Hsp104, are imported through the OM import complex to the intermembrane space, where they are either degraded by intermembrane proteases and peptidases, or continued to be imported through an IM channel to be degraded by matrix proteases such as Pim1.
