Defective Transcytosis of APP and Lipoproteins in human iPSC-derived neurons with Familial Alzheimer’s Disease Mutations

# Abstract
We investigated early phenotypes caused by familial Alzheimer’s Disease (fAD) mutations in isogenic human iPSC-derived neurons. Analysis of neurons carrying fAD PS1 or APP mutations introduced using genome editing technology at the endogenous loci revealed that fAD mutant neurons had previously unreported defects in the recycling state of endocytosis and soma-to-axon transcytosis of APP and lipoproteins. The endocytosis reduction could be rescued through treatment with a β-secretase inhibitor. Our data suggest that accumulation of β-CTF fragments of APP, but not Aβ, slow vesicle formation from an endocytic recycling compartment marked by the transcytotic GTPase Rab11. We confirm previous results that endocytosis is affected in AD, and extend these to uncover a neuron-specific defect. Decreased lipoprotein endocytosis and transcytosis to the axon suggests that a neuron-specific impairment in endocytic axonal delivery of lipoproteins and other key materials might compromise synaptic maintenance in fAD.

## Introduction
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 30 million people worldwide including 11% of those over 65 years of age and 32% of those over 85 ( Fargo and Bleiler, 2014 ). AD is characterized by progressive cerebral dysfunction, memory loss, synapse loss, and neuronal impairment leading to cell death. To date, there are no disease-modifying treatments that can cure or reduce the progression of AD. Genetically, AD is segmented into two populations: sporadic AD (sAD) where the underlying primary cause is not known and rare, autosomal-dominant mutations causing familial AD (fAD) ( Gatz et al., 2006 ). The common pathological features of sAD and fAD patients are the accumulation of senile plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau ( Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014 ). Importantly, many experimental findings regarding AD have come from overexpression studies or studies of non-neuronal cells that lack the unique polarization and compartmentalization of neurons.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD posits that extracellular Aβ fragments of proteolytically processed amyloid precursor protein (APP) and intraneuronal tau accumulate abnormally in sAD and fAD. These accumulations are proposed to drive cellular stress, neurotoxicity, and ultimately synapse loss and neurodegeneration ( Toyn and Ahlijanian, 2014 ). Previous work also reported apparent defects in early endocytosis in post-mortem brains of AD patients ( Cataldo et al., 2001 ; Ginsberg et al., 2010 ). Complementary investigations in overexpression and non-neuronal cellular models also pointed to defects in early endocytosis and endocytic dysfunction driven not by Aβ, but instead by β C-terminal fragments (β-CTF) of APP ( Von Bartheld, 2004 ; Cataldo et al., 2000 ; Ginsberg et al., 2010 ; Karch and Goate, 2014 ; Lee et al., 2010 ; Maxfield, 2014 ). In addition, unbiased screens in non-neuronal cells consistently identified regulators of endocytic trafficking as key to normal levels of APP processing ( Cataldo et al., 2000 ; Ginsberg et al., 2010 ; Treusch et al., 2011 ). However, many of the key investigations did not utilize normal expression levels of AD-related proteins or did not fully examine sorting pathways in highly polarized neurons. Thus, while several important insights on the role of endocytosis in regulating APP processing and sorting have been obtained from various cell models, there is little known about endocytic-dependent trafficking in polarized human neurons with mutations expressed at normal levels.

We tested whether isogenic iPSC-derived human neurons with fAD PS1 and APP mutations induced by genome editing mutagenesis (TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9) at the endogenous loci display amyloid-independent cellular trafficking and transport phenotypes, beyond the known effects on APP processing, that could account for the development of fAD ( Von Bartheld, 2004 ; Cataldo et al., 2000 ; Ginsberg et al., 2010 ; Karch and Goate, 2014 ; Lee et al., 2010 ; Maxfield, 2014 ). Human neurons expressing fAD mutant PS1 and APP at normal expression levels from the endogenous loci, alter subcellular distribution and trafficking of APP and internalized lipoprotein, leading to elevated levels of APP in the soma and reduced levels in the axons. The redistribution of APP is accompanied by the concurrent accumulation of Rab11 endosomal vesicles in the neuronal soma and reduced Rab11 axonal staining, suggesting that the reduction in axonal APP and lipoproteins can be explained by reduced Rab11-dependent soma-to-axon transcytosis and defects in the recycling endosome ( Ascaño et al., 2009 ; Von Bartheld, 2004 ; Buggia-Prévot et al., 2014 ). Knockdown of Rab11 also leads to reductions in APP axonal density and lipoprotein endocytosis and transcytosis. Our study reveals that a common early defect among fAD PS1 and APP mutations is APP β-CTF accumulation-induced impairment of a key neuron-specific traffic pathway, soma to axon transcytosis caused by defects in the recycling endosome.

## Results
PS1 has been reported to have a role in APP trafficking in primary neurons and in non-neuronal cell types ( Burns et al., 2003 ; Cai et al., 2003 ; Gandy et al., 2007 ; Zhang et al., 2006 ). PS1 knockout has been reported to increase cell surface APP ( Leem et al., 2002 ), while PS1 fAD mutations have been shown to delay APP arrival at the cell surface ( Cai et al., 2003 ; Gandy et al., 2007 ). To determine whether the PS1 ΔE9 mutation affects APP localization in human neurons, we generated purified neurons from isogenic iPSC lines from wild-type (PS1 wt/wt ) and lines heterozygous (PS1 wt/ΔE9 ) and homozygous (PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 ) for the PS1 ΔE9 mutation ( Woodruff et al., 2013 ). We stained with an APP antibody, which has minimal staining in cells from APP knockout mice ( Guo et al., 2012 ; Weissmiller et al., 2015 ). We found that PS1 wt/ΔE9 and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons exhibited a modest but significant increase in intracellular APP staining in the cell body ( Figure 1A ). To determine whether APP was also increased on the surface of PS1 ΔE9 neurons, we stained unpermeabilized purified neurons with an N-terminal APP antibody that recognizes the extracellular portion of APP (22C11) ( Figure 1B ). We observed increased APP on the soma surface of PS1 ΔE9 neurons ( Figure 1B ). As a control, we also stained unpermeabilized neurons with a C-terminal antibody and observed minimal staining, as would be expected since the C-terminus of APP would not be present on the cell surface ( Figure 1C ).

We previously published that PS1 ΔE9 human neurons do not exhibit changes in total levels of full-length APP though there are increases in the APP CTFs ( Woodruff et al., 2013 ). The increase in soma APP suggests that APP CTFs are accumulating in the soma of purified neurons and/or that APP is missorted possibly at the expense of axonal APP. We therefore assessed APP staining in the axons of PS1 ΔE9 neurons. To ensure that we were quantifying staining in axons and not dendritic processes, we made use of microfluidic compartments, which separate axons from the bulk somatodendritic population ( Figure 1E ) ( Niederst et al., 2015 ; Selfridge et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2006 ). Neurons grown in microfluidic devices extend long processes into the axonal space that do not stain for the somatodendritic marker Map2 and that do stain for the axonal marker neurofilament-H (SMI31) ( Selfride et al., 2015 ) ( Figure 1E and Figure S1A ). We observed that PS1 ΔE9 axons grown in microfluidic devices have decreased axonal APP puncta and APP puncta intensity ( Figure 1D ); this decrease is sensitive to PS1 ΔE9 gene dose.

To further characterize APP fragments that are present in axons, we also measured soluble APP (sAPP) fragments, sAPPα and sAPPβ. To quantify secreted sAPP, we plated neurons in compartments and allowed them to extend their axons into the axonal space. We then performed a full media change, kept the axons in fluidic isolation, and harvested media from the soma and axon sides. When we measured the sAPPα/sAPPβ ratio from the soma side of the cultures we observed no significant differences between PS1 wt/wt and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 genotypes ( Figure 1F ). Additionally, there were no significant differences in the total levels of sAPPα or sAPPβ from the soma side ( Figure S1B ). However, when we quantified the sAPPα/sAPPβ ratio from axons only, we observed a significant increase from the PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 axons compared to PS1 wt/wt ( Figure 1F ). Upon quantification of the total levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ, we determined that the ratio was increased in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 axons primarily due to a reduction in sAPPβ ( Figure 1F ). To test whether the phenotypic differences that we observed in PS1 ΔE9 neurons might be due to differences in neuronal subtypes in our cultures we stained neurons of each genotype with the neuronal subtype markers GABA, GAD65/67 and vGlut ( Figure S1C ). We found no significant differences in the proportion of cells that stained positive for GABA, GAD65/67 or vGlut between different genotypes ( Figure S1C ).

There are at least two pathways by which APP can be delivered to the axon. The first is by direct delivery from the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the second is by an indirect pathway where APP first arrives at the cell surface of the somatodendritic compartment, then undergoes endocytosis and sorting to the axon. The indirect pathway is a process known as transcytosis and multiple cargo including TrkA ( Ascaño et al., 2009 ) and L1/NgCAM ( Anderson et al., 2005 ; Yap et al., 2008 ) have been demonstrated to be sorted along this pathway in neurons.

An endocytic regulator that functions at the intersection of the TGN and transcytotic pathways is the Rab GTPase Rab11 ( Welz et al., 2014 ). Rab11 has a well-established role in mediating recycling of many receptors including transferrin receptor ( Ullrich et al., 1996 ), and LDL receptors ( Sakane et al., 2010 ; Takahashi et al., 2007 ). In addition to its role in recycling, Rab11 has also been shown to mediate transcytosis in epithelial cells and neurons. Specifically, in neurons, TrkA receptors undergo Rab11-dependent transcytosis to the axon ( Ascaño et al., 2009 ; Lazo et al., 2013 ). Rab11 may also be involved in trafficking of BACE1 to the axon ( Buggia-Prévot et al., 2014 ), colocalizes with some APP in axons ( Niederst et al., 2015 ), and was recently identified in an unbiased Rab GTPase screen in non-neuronal cells as a regulator of Aβ and sAPPβ production ( Udayar et al., 2013 ). Intriguingly, presenilins have also been reported to interact directly with Rab11 through their hydrophilic loop ( Dumanchin et al., 1999 ).

To determine if Rab11 could be playing a role in the reduction of axonal APP in PS1 ΔE9 cells, we stained neurons with a Rab11 antibody and measured Rab11 in the somatodendritic and axonal compartments. The Rab11 staining was reminiscent of the altered APP distribution such that PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons exhibited increased soma Rab11 intensity, Rab11 puncta, and Rab11 puncta area ( Figure 2A ). In axons, both the PS1 wt/ΔE9 and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 genotypes had decreased Rab11 puncta density and puncta intensity ( Figure 2B ). In support of a role of Rab11-dependent trafficking of APP to the axon, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab11 on the soma-side of neurons grown in microfluidic devices resulted in a ~40% reduction in APP axonal density ( Figure 2C ). In keeping with a transcytotic route of APP to the axon, somatodendritic inhibition of endocytosis with Dynasore led to reduced APP (~25% less) and Rab11 (~40% less) density in axons ( Figure 2D ).

Previous publications have implicated alterations in early endosomes and lysosomes in PS1 knockout cells ( Coen et al., 2012 ; Lee et al., 2010 ; Neely et al., 2011 ). We, therefore, looked at the early endosome effector, EEA1, and the lysosomal marker, Lamp2, even though they are not thought to traffic substantially to axons ( Wilson et al., 2000 ). Despite evidence in the literature that early endosomes and lysosomes are dramatically affected in fAD and sAD, EEA1 and Lamp2 staining in PS1 ΔE9 neurons was not obviously different suggesting that they are not playing an active role in sorting APP to the axon ( Figure S2 A and B ).

Since we observed alterations in the subcellular distribution of both APP and Rab11 in PS1 ΔE9 neurons, we investigated whether endocytosis and/or transcytosis could account for the APP localization changes. To assess endocytosis of APP we treated purified neurons with an N-terminal APP antibody (22C11) and allowed cells to internalize antibody for 30 minutes, 2 hours or 4 hours and fixed cells at each of those time points. We then stained with a secondary antibody and quantified the amount of APP endocytosis at each time point ( Figure 3A ). We observed a decrease in APP puncta in the PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 genotype starting at 30 minutes compared to PS1 wt/wt and this decrease was more prominent at both 2 and 4 hours ( Figure 3A ). The PS1 wt/ΔE9 genotype also exhibited decreased APP puncta compared to PS1 wt/wt at the 2 and 4 hour time points. As a control to confirm whether the APP antibody was being endocytosed uniquely via antigen binding, we performed an endocytosis assay with a non-specific antibody and found minimal uptake ( Figure S3A ). To assess whether this endocytosis defect was specific to APP or common to other cargo, we also measured uptake of fluorescently labeled LDL at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours ( Figure 3B ). Similar to what was observed with APP, LDL puncta intensity and LDL puncta density were reduced in PS1 wt/ΔE9 and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons at 2 hours and 4 hours ( Figure 3B ). To test if the differences observed were due to a non-specific defect in endocytosis, we also quantified uptake of fluorescently labeled dextran as a marker of bulk endocytosis. We did not observe any significant differences in dextran endocytosis at any time point ( Figure 3C ). Additionally, we quantified endocytosis of fluorescently labeled transferrin and similar to dextran we did not observe any significant differences ( Figure S3B and C )

We measured transcytosis of APP and LDL by growing neurons in microfluidic compartments. The axon side of the compartment was kept in fluidic isolation from the soma side and APP antibody or labeled LDL was added only to the soma side. Transcytotic delivery of cargo from the soma to the axon is a relatively slow process since internalized cargo has to travel long distances (on the order of millimeters in cultured neurons). After 4 hours of endocytosis, cells were fixed and we quantified the amount of anterogradely transcytosed APP by using an anti-mouse secondary antibody; fluorescent LDL was measured directly ( Figure 3D, E ). We observed that both the PS1 wt/ΔE9 and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 genotypes exhibited decreased APP axonal density and APP intensity after 4 hours of transcytosis ( Figure 3D ). Similarly, LDL axonal density and intensity were also decreased in PS1 wt/ΔE9 and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 axons after 4 hours ( Figure 3E ). These results suggest that the reduction in basal axonal APP in PS1 ΔE9 neurons is due to a decrease in a constitutive transcytosis pathway.

To further investigate the role of Rab11 in endocytosis of LDL and transcytosis of APP and LDL, we used shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab11 in wild type neurons ( Figure 4B ). Knockdown of Rab11 in PS1 wt/wt neurons almost completely abolished LDL endocytosis in the somatodendritic region ( Figure 4A ) and transcytosed LDL was undetectable under Rab11 knockdown conditions ( Figure 4C and D ). Further support for a role of Rab11 mediated transcytosis of APP comes from co-staining experiments where axonal transcytosed APP (22C11) were stained with Rab11. As seen in Figure S4 , 35% of Rab11 overlapped with transcytosed APP in PS1 wt/wt axons and about 25% of transcytosed APP overlapped with Rab11 in PS1 wt/wt axons. The percent of Rab11 with transcytosed 22C11 was reduced in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 axons (as expected given the reduced density of transcytosed 22C11), but the percent of 22C11 with Rab11 remained steady ( Figure S4A ).

The absence of a lipoprotein endocytic defect at early time-points in PS1 ΔE9 neurons suggested that transcription, levels, degradation, or recycling of the LDL receptor may be driving the reduction in transcytosis. While there are many potential LDL receptors, LRP1 was an attractive candidate because of its high expression in brain and neuronal samples ( Zhang et al., 2014 ). To determine if transcription or degradation of LRP1 was affected in PS1 ΔE9 neurons, we treated purified human neurons with unlabeled LDL and harvested neurons for mRNA and protein. We did not observe differences in LRP1 mRNA or protein levels ( Figure 5A ) at baseline or after LDL treatment, suggesting that transcription, total levels, or degradation of LRP1 after LDL treatment are not playing a role in the reduced endocytosis of LDL. Though PS1 has been hypothesized to drive reduced degradation of proteins because of alterations in lysosomal pH ( Nixon and Mcbrayer, 2013 ; Nixon and Yang, 2011 ), we did not observe changes in lysosomal pH in the PS1 ΔE9 neurons as assessed by the two ratiometric pH probes LysoSensor Yellow/Blue Dextran and fluorescein-tetramethylrhodamine Dextran ( Figure S5A ). In addition, degradation of full-length APP is not different in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons treated with cycloheximide ( Figure S5B ) or when lysosome degradation is blocked with chloroquine.

To determine if the amount of lipoprotein receptors at the somatodendritic surface are driving endocytosis defects at later timepoints, we measured LDL receptor amount at baseline and after 4 hours of LDL treatment using two different methods. Purified neurons were incubated at 4°C with labeled LDL for 30 minutes and then fixed (0h time point, this gives a measure of total LDL receptors at the cell surface ( Figure 5B ). Neurons were also incubated for 4 hours with unlabeled LDL, then brought to 4°C, unlabeled LDL was washed off and then cells were incubated with labeled LDL followed by fixation. This gives a measure of LDL receptors at the surface after 4 hours of endocytosis ( Figure 5B ). Under these conditions, there were no differences in surface LDL puncta count in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons compared to PS1 wt/wt neurons ( Figure 5B ). Since LDL could be binding non-specifically to surface proteins, we evaluated specific receptor populations by biotinylating the surface of neurons with a cleavable biotin and used streptavidin beads to pull down surface proteins before and after LDL treatment. Probing for LRP1 demonstrated that the surface levels of LRP1 at baseline were not significantly different between PS1 wt/wt and PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 . However, after 4 hours of LDL treatment, LRP1 receptor levels trend to decreased in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 (p= 0.1293) ( Figure 5C ). Thus, the decrease in LDL endocytosis we observed in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons ( Figure 3B ) can in part be accounted for by the modest (~50%) LRP1 reduction at the neuronal surface after 4 hours of LDL treamtment.

We previously demonstrated that the PS1 ΔE9 mutation impairs γ-secretase activity and APP CTFs accumulate in human PS1 ΔE9 neurons ( Woodruff et al., 2013 ). A previous study also demonstrated that γ-secretase inhibition in MEFs reduces LDL endocytosis ( Tamboli et al., 2008 ). To determine if γ-secretase activity or if the β-CTF fragment might be responsible for the impaired LDL endocytosis in human neurons, we treated PS1 wt/wt neurons with β- and γ-secretase inhibitors and measured LDL endocytosis ( Figure 6A and B ). Inhibition of γ-secretase severely decreased LDL endocytosis at 4 hours while β-secretase inhibition had no significant effect ( Figure 6A and B ). Treatment with both β- and γ-secretase inhibitors caused a marked accumulation of α-CTFs while ablating β-CTFs ( Figure 6C ), but had no effect on LDL endocytosis at 4 hours ( Figure 6B ). These results suggest that the β-CTF, not α-CTF, of APP is responsible for impairing LDL endocytosis in ΔE9 neurons. To further test this possibility, we treated PS1 ΔE9 neurons with a β-secretase inhibitor and measured LDL endocytosis ( Figure 6A and D ). We observed that upon treatment with a β-secretase inhibitor, PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons were rescued in the ability to endocytose LDL ( Figure 6D ). Treatment of PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons with both β- and γ-secretase inhibitors, which abolishes β-CTF and increases α-CTF, also rescued the LDL endocytosis defect ( Figure 6D ), which suggests that accumulation of only the β-CTF is responsible for impaired LDL endocytosis. To test whether β-secretase inhibition could rescue the transcytosis defect that we observed, we treated PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons grown in microfluidic compartments with a β-secretase inhibitor and then measured LDL transcytosis ( Figure 6E and F ). Similar to the endocytosis result, we also observed that β-secretase inhibition significantly increased the amount of transcytosed LDL in PS1 ΔE9/ΔE9 neurons ( Figure 6E ).

Accumulation of APP β-CTFs is a phenotype shared by many APP and PS1 fAD mutations ( Chang and Suh, 2005 ; De Jonghe et al., 2001; McPhie et al., 1997; Sinha and Lieberburg, 1999 ; Wiley et al., 2005). To assess whether other fAD mutations might share a common phenotype of impaired LDL endocytosis, we generated additional isogenic cell lines harboring either the APP V717F (APP V717F ) or APP Swedish (APP swe ) mutations ( Sherrington et al., 1995 ). In neurons homozygous for the APP V717F mutation, there was significantly reduced LDL endocytosis after 4 hours and this defect was rescued by β-secretase inhibition ( Figure 7A and B ). Similar to both the PS1 ΔE9 and APP V717F mutations, neurons homozygous for the APP swe mutation also exhibited decreased LDL endocytosis ( Figure 7A and B ). In contrast to the other fAD mutations, β-secretase inhibition in the APP swe neurons did not rescue the LDL endocytosis defect ( Figure 7A and B ). However, mutant APP Swedish protein has previously been reported to decrease the potency of β-secretase inhibitors (Yamakawa et al., 2009), which could explain why in our study β-secretase inhibition did not rescue the APP swe neurons. These findings demonstrate that the reduction in LDL endocytosis is not specific to the PS1 ΔE9 mutation, but is a phenotype common to fAD APP mutations. Similar to PS1 ΔE9 axons, we also observed reduced basal levels of axonal APP and Rab11 densities and reduced endocytosis of 22C11 at 4h in APP V717F neurons ( Figure S6 ). Thus, endocytosis defects, and perhaps transcytosis defects, are common among at least one fAD PS1 mutation and two fAD APP mutations.

## Discussion
Here we demonstrate that in human neurons with endogenous expression of fAD mutations, induced with genome editing technology, increased β-CTF of APP alters the subcellular localization of APP, the distribution of Rab11, and decreases endocytosis and soma-to-axon transcytosis of LDL. LDL endocytosis and transcytosis defects are rescued by β-Secretase inhibition in at least some of the fAD mutations. Our results show that impaired LDL endocytosis and transcytosis is present in multiple types of fAD mutations ( Figure 7C ) and they together define an apparent defect in the Rab11 recycling endosome. Epidemiologic evidence implicating cholesterol as a major player in AD also dovetails with these molecular and cellular findings (reviewed in Fonseca et al., 2010 ; Wolozin, 2004 ).

We demonstrate that APP β-CTFs may cause impaired LDL uptake by reducing recycling of LRP1 receptors back to the cell surface. One possible mechanism is that β-CTFs bind to LRP1 ( Kounnas et al., 1995 ; Pietrzik et al., 2002 ; Tamboli et al., 2008 ), or other LDL receptors and retain LDL receptors in a Rab11 containing compartment until the β-CTF is cleaved by γ-secretase. This possibility would explain why γ-secretase inhibition impairs LDL uptake and why that defect can be rescued by β-Secretase inhibition. The observation that basal Rab11 is reduced in axons of fAD mutant neurons suggests that a common constitutive recycling/transcytotic pathway is impaired and raises the possibility that modulating Rab11 activity could also rescue fAD phenotypes. While we cannot rule out proteolysis of the 22C11 or labeled LDL probe following endocytosis as a possible explanation for the reduced transcytosis, our data are most consistent with the possibility reported in previous work that early endocytosis is affected ( Cataldo et al., 2000 ).

The finding that fAD neurons have defects in lipoprotein transcytosis is intriguing in light of previous work showing that neurons are dependent on uptake of extracellular cholesterol from lipoprotein particles to perform functions such as axon elongation and synapse formation and maintenance ( Barres and Smith, 2001 ; Lane-Donovan et al., 2014 ; Mauch et al., 2001 ; Nägler et al., 2001 ; Pfrieger, 2003 ; Pierrot et al., 2013 ). In fact, glia-derived cholesterol was reported to enhance synaptogenesis of adult rat CNS ( Mauch et al., 2001 ; Nägler et al., 2001 ) suggesting that a defect in endocytosis and transcytosis of extracellularly-derived cholesterol could have long-term functional consequences leading to impaired neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. For instance, many studies of APOE function have focused on its potential role in mediating Aβ clearance, but APOE has also been identified as the major lipoprotein carrier in the brain and the e4 allele is less efficient in transporting brain cholesterol ( Liu et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, post-mortem studies comparing sAD patients to age-matched controls found that brain cholesterol levels are reduced in the areas of learning and memory, the hippocampus and cortex ( Svennerholm and Gottfries, 1994 ).

Previous work implicated early endosome dysfunction in sAD and some forms of fAD ( Cataldo et al., 2001 ; Ginsberg et al., 2010 ). In contrast to previous studies, we report abnormalities in a Rab11 marked recycling endosome in fAD mutations, which is consistent with previous work on transcytosis that identified Rab11 as an endocytic regulator with a unique role in polarized cells including neurons ( Ascaño et al., 2009 ; Buggia-Prévot et al., 2014 ; Welz et al., 2014 ). Thus, we describe a defect in a neuron-specific pathway that could contribute to the reported early endosomal defects, and could produce AD pathology. In contrast, other recent findings have suggested that lysosomal pathology is the major driver of pathology in PS1 fAD mutations ( Lee et al., 2010 ; Lee et al., 2015 ). Our data suggests that dysfunction in endosomal sorting could drive changes in lysosomal function, rather than an original defect in the lysosome that drives such changes ( Peric and Annaert, 2015 ).

We thus propose that transcytotic trafficking defects could be at the root of many types of fAD and potentially sAD. In fact, endocytic trafficking changes have been reported for APOE4 relative to APOE3 and 2 ( Chen et al., 2010 ). These types of defects could lead to previously reported axonal amyloid-dependent and independent transport defects ( Kim et al., 2015 ; Stokin et al., 2008 ; Vossel et al., 2015 ). Similarly, many fAD mutations thought to act solely by changing Aβ production may in fact also act by changing sorting and trafficking signals in β-CTF of APP leading to changes in constituents of axonal vesicles derived by transcytotic trafficking of lipoproteins and other key synaptic constituents. Although it may seem counter-intuitive that cleavage of β-CTF is needed to generate axonal vesicles containing β-CTF or full-length APP, we suggest that β-CTF cleavage happens in the portion of the recycling endosome that remains in the soma and that buds off axonal vesicles with APP, lipoproteins, and other components ( Figure 7C ). Finally, we note that the defects we report occur in the absence of overexpression of any of the proteins involved and thus may accurately reflect the earliest changes from normal behavior generated by fAD.

## Experimental Procedures
Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism. Normality for each data set was assessed using D’Agostino-Pearson test. When data were normally distributed, a two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare genotypes. For precise p-value comparisons, a multiple t-test was done after ANOVA calculations. Most immunofluorescence data were non-normally distributed and a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison was used to compare genotype medians. Data are depicted with bar graphs of the mean ± SEM of all values in an experiment or box plots where the median is depicted with a line and whiskers indicate the Tukey distribution as determined by GraphPad Prism.

Microfluidic compartments were made in house as previously described ( Niederst et al., 2015 ). Briefly, Sylgard 182 (Ellsworth Adhesives, Germantown, WI) was used to mold devices. Once cured, devices were cut and then washed with isopropanol, water, and 70% ethanol. Devices were plasma treated and mounted onto glass coverslips. The mounted device was this coated with PO/L as described above.

sAPP was measured from conditioned media from microfluidic compartments from the soma side (contains soma, axons, dendrites) and the axon side (axons only) 48 hours after a full media change in which the axons were kept in fluidic isolation. sAPP was measured using the MSD sAPPα/sAPPβ human kit (Meso Scale Discovery). The kit has sensitivity down to 120 pg/mL for sAPPα and 52 pg/mL for sAPPβ, and all measurements were in the linear range.

Purified neurons were grown in 384-well imaging plates at a density of 25,000 cells per well for 7–9 days post-sort. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 30 min at 37°C, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked (10% donkey serum, 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). For surface labeling experiments, neurons were not permeabilized. For compartment experiments, PDMS microfluidic devices were plasma bonded directly onto glass coverslips ( Niederst et al., 2015 ). Neurons were seeded at a density of 1–3 million cells per compartment and grown for 7–10 days (until axons passed through the channels). Compartments were then fixed as above and imaged. Antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments were anti-Rab11 (1:1000, Life Technologies 71-5300), anti-APP Y188 (1:200, Abcam ab32136), anti-APP 22C11 (1:100, EMD Millipore, MAB348), anti-EEA1 (1:100, BD 610457), anti-NF-H (1:1000, Biolegend SMI-31r), and anti-Map2 (1:500, ab5392). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and Dylight 405 donkey anti-chicken IgY from (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-475-155) were used at 1:200. Images were acquired on a Zeiss confocal microscope.

For constitutive uptake endocytosis assays, neurons were incubated with LDL-BODIPY (20 μg/ml, Invitrogen L3483) or Dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) MW 10,000 (250 μg/ml, Invitrogen D1817), at 37°C for indicated times, fixed, and imaged. For all fixed endocytosis assays, a custom ImageJ program was used to identify Map2-positive soma and automatically generate region of interests (ROI) corresponding to soma. Mean intensity and puncta count per soma were determined and averaged across images and experiments. All endocytosis assays were repeated at least three times. In experiments where secretase inhibitors were used, cells were treated with the inhibitor 24 hours prior to the experiment and kept in the presence of the inhibitor for the duration of the experiment. Compound E (GSI, EMD Chemicals) was used at 200nM in endocytosis assays and at 100nM and 1μM for Western blot. βIV Inhibitor (β Inh, Millipore) was used at 4μM.

For transcyctosis experiments, neurons were grown in compartments and treated on the soma side with LDL-Bodipy (20 μg/ml), LDL-DiI (12.5 μg/ml), or mouse anti-22C11 (1:100) for 4 hours with axons in fluidic isolation. Axonal puncta analysis was done as previously described ( Szpankowski et al., 2012 ). Axons were imaged at 100x and a custom Guassian-fitting colocalization package in MATLAB (MathWorks) was used to calculate axonal density, puncta intensity, and percent colocalization per axon.

Neuronal media was changed to warm fresh media or media supplanted with 12.5 μg/ml of unlabeled LDL for 4 hours. At the end of the incubation, neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated at 4C with 2mM EZ-Link ™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Life Technologies) in PBS for 30 minutes. Cells were then lysed in equal volumes of RIPA buffer. For pulldown experiments, 200 μg of harvested protein at 0.5 μg/μl was incubated with 50 μl of pre-washed Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Life Technologies, 88817) overnight at 4°C. The next day, beads were washed to remove residual, unbound proteins and biotinylated proteins were released from the streptavidin beads by boiling samples in loading buffer at 100°C. Westerns were run with 5% of input, 5% of supernatant, and 50% of pull down. Quantification of recycling was determined based on input signal(Pull down/Input).
