# Title
Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study

# Abstract
Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. So far, to our knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder. In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we collected samples from white participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to established clinical or pathological criteria. In the discovery stage (with the case cohort recruited from 22 centres in ten countries and the controls derived from two publicly available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes studies [phs000404.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1] in the USA), we performed genotyping and exploited the recently established Haplotype Reference Consortium panel as the basis for imputation. Pathological samples were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. We did association analyses in all participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, and also only in participants with pathological diagnosis. In the replication stage, we performed genotyping of significant and suggestive results from the discovery stage. Lastly, we did a meta-analysis of both stages under a fixed-effects model and used logistic regression to test for association in each stage. This study included 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (1324 with pathological diagnosis) and 4454 controls (1216 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies vs 3791 controls in the discovery stage; 527 vs 663 in the replication stage). Results confirm previously reported associations: APOE (rs429358; odds ratio [OR] 2·40, 95% CI 2·14–2·70; p=1·05 × 10 −48 ), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0·73, 0·66–0·81; p=6·39 × 10 −10 ), and GBA (rs35749011; OR 2·55, 1·88–3·46; p=1·78 × 10 −9 ). They also provide some evidence for a novel candidate locus, namely CNTN1 (rs7314908; OR 1·51, 1·27–1·79; p=2·32 × 10 −6 ); further replication will be important. Additionally, we estimate the heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies to be about 36%. Despite the small sample size for a genome-wide association study, and acknowledging the potential biases from ascertaining samples from multiple locations, we present the most comprehensive and well powered genetic study in dementia with Lewy bodies so far. These data show that common genetic variability has a role in the disease.

## Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. 1 Despite this fact, very little attention has been devoted to understanding the pathogenesis of this disorder, particularly when compared with the other common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

So far, the only fully penetrant genetic variants that have been identified and replicated as a specific cause of dementia with Lewy bodies are SNCA point mutations and gene dosage. Three major factors might have contributed to this low number of causative mutations. First, dementia with Lewy bodies, often a disease of old age, is not commonly seen in multiplex kindreds, meaning that successful linkage studies have been rare. 2 Second, the accurate clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is complex, with a high rate of misdiagnosis. 3 Third, even the largest cohorts of dementia with Lewy body samples have been generally small, in many instances including as few as 100 patients. 4 , 5 However, the fact that dementia with Lewy bodies has a strong genetic component is currently indisputable. The ε4 allele of APOE is recognised to be a strong risk factor, 6 , 7 as are heterozygous mutations and common polymorphisms in the glucocerebrosidase gene ( GBA ). 8 Both of these results have stemmed from candidate gene association studies; APOE was known to be strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and GBA was known to be a strong risk factor for Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body disorders. In addition to these genetic associations with susceptibility, in 2016, our group provided evidence that dementia with Lewy bodies has a heritable component. 9

No overlap in common genetic risk has been shown to exist between Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, 10 a fact that is not entirely surprising in view of the differences in phenotype. However, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the overlaps and differences in clinical and pathological presentation between dementia with Lewy bodies and both Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease stem, at least in part, from aspects in their underlying genetic architecture and, consequently, disease pathobiology. Specific genes and loci associated with disease and the strength of association are factors that can be expected to modulate these phenotypic overlaps and differences. However, despite these encouraging findings, large-scale, unbiased genetic studies of dementia with Lewy bodies have not yet been done, which is probably due to the difficulty in identifying large, homogeneous cohorts of people with the disease.

To address the need for more powerful and comprehensive genetic studies of dementia with Lewy bodies, we performed the first large-scale genome-wide association study in this disease.

## Methods
In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we examined data from white participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to either clinical or pathological consensus criteria. 11 Most participants were diagnosed using pathological criteria and were included only when the likelihood of a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies was “intermediate” or “high”. 11 Samples were collected at 22 different centres across ten countries in Europe, North America, and Australia. Pathological samples were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. White control participants in the discovery stage are part of the “general research use” controls from the two studies publicly available at the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (The Genetic Architecture of Smoking and Smoking Cessation [phs000404.v1.p1] and Genetic Analysis of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis [phs000982.v1.p1]). For the replication stage, white controls were from the Mayo Clinic Florida control database. Investigators at every site obtained written informed consent from patients and control individuals and approval from a local ethics committee.

Participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped in either the Illumina Omni2.5M array or the Illumina OmniExpress genotyping array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Controls were genotyped in either the Illumina Omni2.5M array or the Illumina Omni1M array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Autosomal variants with GenTrain scores of more than 0·7 were included in the quality control stage. We removed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a call rate of less than 95%, a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p value in controls of less than 1 × 10 −7 , or a minor allele frequency of less than 0·01. Samples were removed if they had substantial non-European admixture, were duplicates or first-degree or second-degree relatives of other samples, had a genotype call rate of less than 98%, or had substantial cryptic relatedness scores (PI_HAT >0·1).

We determined population outliers by principal components analysis, using SNPs passing the aforementioned quality-control filters. We used PLINK (version 1.9) 12 to do linkage disequilibrium-based pruning. Genotypes for remaining SNPs were combined with 1000Genomes phase 3 genotypes for samples from the YRI, CEU, JPT, and CHB reference populations, and subjected to principal components analysis. Individuals lying farther than a quarter of the distance between CEU and JPT/CHB/YRI when plotted on the axes of the first two principal components were deemed to have substantial non-European admixture and were excluded ( appendix p 8 ).

Because samples were genotyped in a variety of arrays, we selected only variants that intersected between all arrays to be included in the imputation stage. We performed imputation using the most recent reference panels provided by the Haplotype Reference Consortium (version 1.1, 2016). We used Eagle (version 2.3) to prephase haplotypes on the basis of genotype data. 13 , 14 We did the imputation using the Michigan Imputation Server. 15 Following imputation, we kept variants passing a standard imputation quality threshold ( R 2 ≥0·3) for further analysis.

We used logistic regression, implemented in PLINK1.9, 12 to test for association of hard-call variants with the binary case–control phenotype using sex as a covariate. We examined variants under an additive model (ie, effect of each minor allele) and estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. To control for population stratification, we used coordinates from the top six principal component dimensions as additional covariates in the logistic regression models. We used Q–Q plots and the genomic inflation factor (λ) to test for residual effects of population stratification not fully controlled for by the inclusion of the principal components analysis and cohort covariates in the regression model. Additionally, we have done a subanalysis in the discovery stage, including only participants with pathologically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies.

Moreover, to take into account the uncertainty of imputation, we have done the same association in PLINK1.9 using dosage data.

We did gene-wise burden tests using all variants with an effect in protein sequence and a maximum minor allele frequency of 5%, using SKAT-O 16 , 17 as implemented in EPACTS. 18 We used the top six principal components and sex as covariates in the burden test.

Replication was attempted for top variants showing a p value in the discovery stage of less than 5 × 10 −6 . We tested a total of 32 signals for replication using a Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX SNP panel (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA; appendix p 4 ). We did power calculations for replication sample size selection using the R package RPower. We estimated a mean statistical power of 81% for the 32 signals on the basis of sample size, variant frequency, and effect size in the discovery stage, and used a replication p value threshold of 0·05. We tested associations in the replication stage using logistic regression models adjusted for age (age at onset for the patients with clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies, age at death for the patients with a high pathological likelihood of dementia with Lewy bodies, and age at recruitment to study for controls) and sex.

We did a combined meta-analysis of stage 1 and 2 with GWAMA 19 under a fixed-effects model, using estimates of the allelic OR and 95% CIs.

To estimate the phenotypic variance explained by the genotyped SNPs in this cohort, we used genetic restricted maximum likelihood analysis as implemented in the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis tool. 20 , 21 We used the first ten principal components as covariates and a disease prevalence of 0·1%. 22 We also estimated the partitioned heritability by chromosome, for which a separate genetic relationship matrix was generated for each chromosome. Each matrix was then run in a separate restricted maximum likelihood analysis. We applied linear regression to determine the relation between heritability and chromosome length.

## Results
This study included a total of 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and 4454 controls. The majority of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies were neuropathologically assessed (n=1324), providing a greater level of diagnostic detail. 987 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped with the Illumina Omni2.5M array and 700 with the Illumina OmniExpress genotyping array. 1523 controls were genotyped with the Illumina Omni2.5M array and 2847 with the Illumina Omni1M array. Application of quality control filters to the dataset at the discovery stage yielded high-quality genotypes at 448 155 SNPs for 1216 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies and 3791 controls ( table 1 ). A total of 52 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were excluded for cryptic relatedness, 20 for genetic ancestry, and the remaining 399 for low call rates or poor genotyping. After imputation and quality control, genotypes for 8 397 716 variants were available for downstream analyses. After linkage disequilibrium-based pruning with PLINK (version 1.9) 12 to quasi-independence (variance inflation factor=2), 130 715 SNPs remained in the dataset. The Q–Q plot and genomic inflation factor (λ=1·01) indicated good control of population stratification ( appendix p 9 ).

Five regions were associated with dementia with Lewy bodies risk at genome-wide significance (p<5 × 10 −8 ) in the discovery stage ( figure 1 ; table 2 ). These regions included the previously described Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease loci APOE (rs429358; OR 2·40, 95% CI 2·14–2·70; p=1·05 × 10 −48 ), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0·73, 0·66–0·81; p=6·39 × 10 −10 ), and GBA (rs35749011; OR 2·55, 1·88–3·46; p=1·78 × 10 −9 ). Additionally, loci overlapping BCL7C/STX1B (rs897984; OR 0·74, 0·67–0·82; p=3·30 × 10 −9 ) and GABRB3 (rs1426210; OR 1·34, 1·21–1·48; p=2·62 × 10 −8 ) were also genome-wide significant. A subanalysis including only participants with pathologically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies revealed that all but GABRB3 maintained their genome-wide significance in that smaller dataset ( table 2 ; appendix p 11 ). Furthermore, when undertaking the same associations in PLINK1.9 to take into account the uncertainty of imputation, results were identical to the best-guess calls ( appendix p 8 ).

A total of 527 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies and 663 controls from the Mayo Clinic were included in the replication stage ( table 3 ). The replication stage of the genome-wide association study design provided independent replication (p<0·05) for three of the loci ( APOE , SNCA , and GBA ), all of which were also genome-wide significant in the combined analysis of both stages ( table 2 ; appendix p 4 ).

In the discovery stage, suggestive evidence of an association (p<5 × 10 −6 ) with dementia with Lewy bodies was also seen for two loci: SOX17 and CNTN1 . The association at SOX17 did not replicate ( appendix p 4 ). For CNTN1 , the association with dementia with Lewy bodies (rs7314908; 1·51, 95% CI 1·27–1·79; p=2·32 × 10 −6 ) improved slightly when performing the subanalysis on the participants with pathologically confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies (rs7314908; OR 1·58, 1·32–1·88; p=4·32 × 10 −7 ), and this candidate locus showed evidence of replication with very similar effect size to that in the discovery stage (rs79329964; OR 1·54, 1·32–1·79; p=0·03; rs79329964 was used in replication as a proxy for rs7314908).

A systematic assessment of genetic loci previously associated with Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease showed no evidence of other genome-wide significant associations in this dementia with Lewy bodies cohort ( appendix p 5 ). These loci include the TREM2 locus, where the p.Arg47His variant has been shown to have a strong effect in Alzheimer’s disease. 24 In our cohort this variant did not show genome-wide significant levels of association (OR 3·46, 95% CI 1·54–7·77; p=0·002), despite the over-representation in people with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with controls. Similarly, MAPT , which is strongly associated with Parkinson’s disease and has been previously linked to dementia with Lewy bodies, 25 shows no strong evidence of association in this study (rs17649553; OR 0·86, 0·76–0·96; p=0·0126).

To examine whether the association with SNCA is independent of that seen in Parkinson’s disease, we conditioned our analysis on the top Parkinson’s disease variant (rs356182), which showed only a negligible effect on the DLB association (conditioned OR 0·70, 95% CI 0·63–0·78; p=2·89 × 10 −10 ; figure 2 ). To gain insight into potential regulatory effects of this distinct SNCA signal, we used expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project Consortium and the Harvard Brain Bank Resource Center to determine whether rs7681440 and rs7681154 (a variant shown to have an independent association for Parkinson’s disease that is in strong linkage disequilibrium [ R 2 =0·91] with the rs7681440 SNCA variant) affect gene expression as eQTLs. In the GTEx data, the most associated SNP in dementia with Lewy bodies is a strong eQTL in the cerebellum for RP11-67M1.1 , a known antisense gene located at the 5′ end of SNCA , with the alternative allele showing a reduction in expression of RP11-67M1.1 ( figure 3 ). Additionally, rs7681154 was associated with SNCA expression in the cerebellum using the Harvard Brain Bank Resource Center results (p=2·87 × 10 −11 ; figure 3 ), with the alternative allele associated with increased SNCA expression.

We assessed linkage disequilibrium across the LRRK2 locus region and that analysis revealed that rs79329964 is in equilibrium with both p.Gly2019Ser ( R 2 =0·000043) and with the Parkinson’s disease hit at this locus, rs76904798 ( R 2 =0·003), suggesting rs79329964 to be an independent association from the Parkinson’s disease risk. Although samples were not screened for p.Gly2019Ser directly, the variant was well imputed ( R 2 =0·94). The exclusion of all samples that carried the p.Gly2019Ser variant showed no significant effect on the association at the CNTN1 locus. Notably, the p.Gly2019Ser variant showed a higher minor allele frequency in participants with dementia with Lewy bodies (0·0021) than in controls (0·0003).

Gene-based burden analysis of all low frequency and rare variants (minor allele frequency <0·05) changing the aminoacid sequence, showed a single genome-wide significant result comprised of six variants at GBA (p.Asn409Ser, p.Thr408Met, p.Glu365Lys, p.Arg301His, p.Ile20Val, and p.Lys13Arg; p=1·29 × 10 −13 ). No other gene showed evidence of strong association with disease or overlapped single variant analysis results ( table 4 ).

Using the first ten principal components as covariates and a disease prevalence of 0·1%, estimation of the phenotypic variance attributed to genetic variants showed a heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies of 36% (SD 0·03). As expected for a common complex disease, we found a strong correlation between chromosome length and heritability (p=6·88 × 10 −5 ; figure 4 ).

The heritability for dementia with Lewy bodies at chromosome 19 is much higher than what would be expected considering the chromosome’s size and probably reflects the role of APOE . Notably, chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 13 all have higher heritability for dementia with Lewy bodies than expected, although none of them has variants with genome-wide significant results.

## Discussion
This is the first comprehensive, unbiased study of common and intermediate frequency genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies. We identified five genome-wide significant associations in the discovery stage ( APOE , BCL7C / STX1B , SNCA , GBA , and GABRB3 ), with the associations regarding APOE , SNCA , and GBA being confirmed in the replication stage and in the combined analysis of both stages.

The most significant association signal is seen at the APOE locus ( APOE ε4), which has been previously shown to be highly associated with dementia with Lewy bodies. 6 , 7 As described, APOE ε4 is the major genetic risk locus for Alzheimer’s disease and has been implicated in cognitive impairment within Parkinson’s disease, although not with the risk of Parkinson’s disease itself. The locus has also been reported to affect the levels of both β-amyloid and Lewy body pathology in brains of patients. 27 In a small Finnish dataset, 28 the ε4 allele association with dementia with Lewy bodies was largely driven by the subgroup with concomitant Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

The second strongest association is seen at the SNCA locus. Results from our conditioned analysis confirmed the different association profile between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease that we had previously reported. 7 SNCA is the most significant common genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease, with rs356182 having a meta-analysis p value of 1·85 × 10 −82 (OR 1·34, 1·30–1·38) in PDGene. This variant is located 3’ to the gene, 29 whereas in dementia with Lewy bodies, no association was found in that region ( figure 2 ). The most associated dementia with Lewy bodies SNP for the SNCA locus (rs7681440) has a Parkinson’s disease meta-analysis p value of more than 0·05 in PDGene. When doing a conditional analysis on the top Parkinson’s disease SNP (rs356182), Nalls and colleagues 29 reported an independent association at the 5′ region of the gene (rs7681154), and this variant is in strong linkage disequilibrium ( R 2 =0·91) with the rs7681440 SNCA variant identified in our study. It is tempting to speculate that these differences might reflect pathobiological differences between the two diseases, perhaps mediated by differential regulation of gene expression. The results in the GTEx data, showing that the most associated SNP in dementia with Lewy bodies is a strong eQTL in the cerebellum for RP11-67M1.1 , are compatible with a model in which rs7681440 genotypes affect the expression levels of SNCA indirectly through the action of RP11-67M1.1 . More specifically, the alternative allele associates with a decreased expression of RP11-67M1.1 and consequently reduced repression of SNCA transcription (increased SNCA expression), which is in accordance with an increased frequency of the alternative allele in participants with dementia with Lewy bodies when compared with controls. Additionally, the relationship between rs7681154 and SNCA expression is supported by the high expression of SNCA in the brain and the association of rs7681440 with increased SNCA expression in whole blood (p=2·13 × 10 −38 ). 30 , 31 However, further investigation of the identified significant eQTLs is needed because the effect was seen for only one brain region. This localised effect could plausibly result from low overall expression of RP11-67M1.1 and higher RNA quality in the cerebellum than in other assayed brain regions in these datasets. Notably, both eQTLs’ effects fit with a model of increased SNCA expression in participants with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with controls.

The most significant marker at the GBA locus (rs35682329) is located 85 781 base pairs downstream of the gene and is in high linkage disequilibrium (D′=0·9; R 2 =0·8) with p.Glu365Lys (also reported in the scientific literature as E365K, E326K, and rs2230288), which has been suggested as a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies. 8 The top associated variant for Parkinson’s disease at this locus is the rs71628662 (PDGene meta-analysis OR 0·52 [95% CI 0·46–0·58; p=6·86 × 10 −28 ]). This variant is also in high linkage disequilibrium with the top SNP identified here (D′=0·9 and R 2 =0·8). In this study, we show similar effect sizes for APOE (OR 2·40) and GBA (OR 2·55) in dementia with Lewy bodies. Gene burden-based analysis showed GBA as the only genome-wide significant association with dementia with Lewy bodies risk. The inexistence of other associations should be interpreted with some caution. Because we were not ascertaining the complete spectrum of genetic variability, other genes could have had a significant burden of genetic variants that were simply not captured in our study design, despite our use of the most recent imputation panel.

Although in our meta-analysis we saw a genome-wide significant association with dementia with Lewy bodies at the BCL7C/STX1B locus, this association was mostly driven by the discovery-stage data (replication-stage results were OR 0·98; p=0·83) and further replication is needed. That being acknowledged, an association at the BCL7C/ STX1B locus has been previously reported for Parkinson’s disease. 29 , 32 The top Parkinson’s disease-associated variants at this locus were rs14235 (synonymous; located at BCKDK ) and rs4889603 (intronic; located at SETD1A ). The top SNP identified in dementia with Lewy bodies at this locus (rs897984) shows the same direction of association seen in Parkinson’s disease (OR 0·93, 95% CI 0·90–0·96), a Parkinson’s disease meta-analysis p value of 1·34 × 10 −5 (data from PDgene), and strong linkage disequilibrium with both Parkinson’s disease hits ( R 2 =0·28–0·32; correlation p values<0·0001). This is a gene-rich region of the genome ( appendix p 9 ), making accurate nomination of the gene driving the association difficult. Mining data from the GTEx project showed that rs897984 is not an eQTL for any gene in the locus. Nonetheless, in both Parkinson’s disease studies, the nominated gene at the locus was STX1B , probably due to its function as a synaptic receptor. 33 Additionally, STX1B has a distinctive pattern of expression across tissues, presenting the highest expression in the brain. In this tissue, when compared with the closest genes in the locus ( HSD3B7, BCL7C, ZNF668, MIR4519, CTF1, FBXL19, ORAI3, SETD1A, STX4 ), STX1B also shows the highest levels of expression ( appendix p 10 ). In 2014, mutations in STX1B were shown to cause fever-associated epileptic syndromes 34 and myoclonic astatic epilepsy. 35

Although not quite genome-wide significant in the discovery stage, the association between CNTN1 and dementia with Lewy bodies risk replicated with a very similar association OR as the discovery stage. Interestingly, the locus has been previously associated with Parkinson’s disease in a genome-wide study of identical-by-descent segments in an Ashkenazi cohort, 36 and with cerebral amyloid deposition, assessed with PET imaging in APOE ε4 non-carriers. 37 This locus also did not reach genome-wide significance with clinicopathological Alzheimer’s disease dementia (p=5·21 × 10 −6 ). 38 The contact in 1 protein, encoded by CNTN1 , is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neuronal membrane protein that functions as a cell-adhesion molecule with important roles in axonal function. 39 , 40 Mutations in CNTN1 were found to cause a familial form of lethal congenital myopathy. 41 Contactin 1 drives Notch-signalling activation and modulates neuroinflammation events, possibly participating in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders. 42 A functional protein association network analysis of CNTN1 using STRING shows contactin 1 is in the same network as PSEN2 ( appendix p 11 ), supporting its potential role in neurodegeneration. Further replication will be important in view of the absence of a genome-wide significant association in the discovery stage; however, this association seems promising. Notably, LRRK2 is located less than 500 000 base pairs away from the most associated SNP at this locus, which could suggest that the association might be driven by variation at the LRRK2 locus. Further validation of the involvement of CNTN1 variation in modifying risk of dementia with Lewy bodies will be important.

In addition to performing a genome-wide association study with clinicopathological Alzheimer’s disease dementia, Beecham and colleagues 38 also analysed commonly comorbid neuropathological features seen in elderly individuals with dementia, including Lewy body disease. In this latter analysis, only the APOE locus was found to achieve genome-wide significance. However, when testing known common Alzheimer’s disease risk variants with coincident neuropathological features, Beecham and colleagues identified hits at SORL1 and MEF2C , finding them to be nominally associated. In our cohort of participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, we found no genome-wide significant associations between these variants and disease. Similarly, we had previously reported an association at the SCARB2 locus with dementia with Lewy bodies. 7 In the larger dataset of the present study, the association remained at the suggestive level and did not reach genome-wide significance (most significant SNP in the present study, rs13141895; p=9·58 × 10 −4 ). No other variant previously reported to be significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease in recent genome-wide association study meta-analyses showed a genome-wide significant association with dementia with Lewy bodies. The most significant Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease variants at the following loci showed nominal (p<0·05) association levels: MAPT , BIN1 , GAK , HLA-DBQB1 , CD2AP , INPP5D , ECHDC3 , and SCIMP . Additionally, variants previously suggested to be associated with Lewy-related pathology in a Finnish cohort, 28 did not show evidence of association in this study ( appendix p 5 ). See appendix pp 12–70 for colocalisation plots of association between dementia with Lewy bodies and either Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease.

This study has notable limitations. The control population is not perfectly matched to the case cohort because it was derived from publicly available data. To address this, we have used all available information (both clinical and genetic) to create a control cohort that is as similar as possible to the case cohort. Additionally, despite using the same diagnostic criteria for all included participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, diagnostic measurements were collected in a variety of locations, suggesting that diagnostic accuracy might have been variable, with contamination from participants with Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, we do not see an over-representation of genetic risk factors from those diseases in our results (eg, MAPT , CLU , or CR1 ), suggesting minimum inclusion. Similarly, population stratification could bias the results because samples were collected in various countries. In the present study, we have used standard methodology to correct for any such bias and, consequently, our results show no evidence of population stratification as evidenced by the Q–Q plot as defined by the acquired unbiased genotype data. Additionally, participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped at three locations and controls were all derived from publicly available datasets, using a mixture of genotyping arrays, which could provide a source of genotyping bias. However, our approach was to select variants that were at the intersection of all used arrays before imputation, which makes use, effectively, of the same genotyping probes for all samples. This approach has been shown to remove any bias from this type of result and any effects of using different array scanners are negligible for high-quality variants. 43

This is the first large-scale genome-wide association study in dementia with Lewy bodies. We estimate the heritability of dementia with Lewy bodies to be approximately 36%, which is similar to what is known to occur in Parkinson’s disease. 44 This finding shows that, despite not having multiple causative genes identified so far, genetics has a relevant role in the common forms of dementia with Lewy bodies. Additionally, we provide evidence suggesting that novel dementia with Lewy bodies loci are likely to be found at chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 13 in view of the high heritability estimates at these chromosomes. A significant majority of our case cohort in the present study was comprised of participants with neuropathological diagnoses, which provide a greater level of information for diagnostic accuracy. These results provide us with the first glimpse into the molecular pathogenesis of dementia with Lewy bodies; they reveal that this disorder has a strong genetic component and suggest a unique genetic risk profile. From a molecular perspective, dementia with Lewy bodies does not simply sit between Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease; instead, the combination of risk alleles is unique, with loci that are established risk factors for those diseases having no clear role in dementia with Lewy bodies (eg, MCCC1 , STK39 , CLU , CR1 , or PICALM ). Further increases in the size of dementia with Lewy body cohorts will probably reveal additional common genetic risk loci, and these will, in turn, improve understanding of this disease, its commonalities, and differences with other neurodegenerative conditions, ultimately allowing the identification of disease-specific targets for future therapeutic approaches.
