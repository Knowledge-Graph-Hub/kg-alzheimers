# Title
A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies 17 new Parkinson’s disease risk loci

# Abstract
Common variant genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have, to date, identified >24 risk loci for Parkinson’s disease (PD). To discover additional loci, we carried out a GWAS comparing 6,476 PD cases with 302,042 controls, followed by a meta-analysis with a recent study of over 13,000 PD cases and 95,000 controls at 9,830 overlapping variants. We then tested 35 loci ( P < 1 × 10 −6 ) in a replication cohort of 5,851 cases and 5,866 controls. We identified 17 novel risk loci ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) in a joint analysis of 26,035 cases and 403,190 controls. We used a neurocentric strategy to assign candidate risk genes to the loci. We identified protein-altering or cis –expression quantitative trait locus ( cis -eQTL) variants in linkage disequilibrium with the index variant in 29 of the 41 PD loci. These results indicate a key role for autophagy and lysosomal biology in PD risk, and suggest potential new drug targets for PD.

## ONLINE METHODS
The PDWBS is a genome-wide analysis of 6,476 PD cases and 302,042 control subjects, all of whom were customers of 23andMe Inc. and consented to participate in research. The study protocol was approved by the external AAHRPP-accredited institutional review board, Ethical and Independent Review Services (E&I Review). Cases and controls were designated on the basis of surveys 10 . Controls were selected from 23andMe Inc. research participants who did not self-report as having been diagnosed with PD. Although the use of self-reported controls can result in a reduction of power, the effect of this on the current study was probably minimal ( Supplementary Note 1 ). Any samples present in the PDGene study 8 were removed from the PDWBS analysis. The average age of cases and controls was 67.6 and 50.8 years, respectively. The study also included 147 cases (2.3%) and 554 controls (0.18%) that were LRRK2 G2019S carriers. Removing LRRK2 G2019S carriers from the analysis removed genome-wide significant associations at the LRRK2 locus.

DNA extraction and genotyping were performed on saliva samples by CLIA-certified CAP-accredited clinical laboratories of the Laboratory Corporation of America. Samples were genotyped on one of the following four platforms: V1 and V2, two variants of the Illumina HumanHap550+ BeadChip, with ~25,000 custom SNPs and ~950,000 total SNPs; V3, Illumina OmniExpress+BeadChip with custom SNPs to increase overlap with the V2 chip, with a total of ~950,000 SNPs; and V4, a custom chip that included SNPs overlapping V2 and V3 chips, low-frequency coding variants and ~570,000 SNPs. Samples with a call rate lower than 98.5% were reanalyzed, and research participants with samples that failed repeatedly were re-contacted and asked to provide additional samples.

Research participants were restricted to those of mainly (>97%) European ancestry 10 , 45 . All research participants in the study were also required to share <700 cM identity by descent (IBD) (estimated by a segmental IBD estimation algorithm 46 ), corresponding approximately to the sharing expected between first cousins. We additionally excluded individuals who shared >700 cM IBD with any 23andMe research participant whose data was used in the PDGene GWAS. Data were imputed on 1000 Genomes phase 1 haplotypes (September 2013 release) with Minimac2 on default settings 11 , 47 . Imputation was run separately on data from each genotyping platform.

For genotyped SNPs, SNPs were removed if they were genotyped on only the V1 and/or the V2 chip, if they failed a parent–offspring transmission test on trio data, if they were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( P < 10 −20 ), or if they had a call rate < 0.90. For imputed SNPs, SNPs were removed if they had an average r 2 < 0.5 or minimum r 2 < 0.3 in any imputation batch, or failed a test for imputation batch effect (testing imputation dosage with imputation batch; P < 10 −50 ).

We applied logistic regression assuming an additive model to test for association between case/control status and either genotypes or imputed dosages (for imputed SNPs). Only SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.1% were analyzed. Covariates were added to adjust for age, sex, the first five principal components, and genotyping platform version. A total of 12,896,220 variants (11,933,700 SNPs) were analyzed. The genomic inflation factor was calculated from the median P value of analyzed variants. Scaling of the genomic inflation factor by sample size was carried out as described previously for 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls 48 .

Summary odds ratios, 95% CIs, and P values of the 10,000 most significant GWAS meta-analysis results were obtained from PDGene (“URLs”). Cohort descriptions, quality control, and meta-analysis for this study have been described previously 8 . SNP s.e. was derived from the reported P values and odds ratios. More specifically, the z -statistic was calculated as the square root of the inverse χ-square transformation of the P value, and the s.e. was calculated as follows: s.e.m. = ln(odds ratio)/absolute( z -score).

There were 9,830 SNPs in common between the PDGene and the PDWBS data sets. A fixed-effects model based on inverse-variance weighting, as implemented in METAL, was used to combine summary statistics from the two studies 14 . Heterogeneity values ( I 2 and Q ) were obtained with PLINK 49 . Novel signals of association were defined as genome-wide significant associations in the meta-analysis that did not overlap loci associated with PD at genome-wide significant thresholds in the PDGene data (35 loci with P < 1 × 10 −6 ).

The NeuroX cohort was previously described 8 , 17 . Briefly, 5,851 cases and 5,866 controls of European ancestry were genotyped on a semi-custom NeuroX array. A logistic regression was carried out to test for association, with covariates to adjust for age, sex, and population ancestry (the first five principal components). Twenty-five of the 35 novel loci were directly genotyped on the chip, and four additional SNPs had suitable proxies ( r 2 > 0.9). At these 29 SNPs, we carried out a fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis14 for all three studies (PDGene, PDWBS, and NeuroX) as described above.

Conditional analysis was run on all 17 loci that were significantly associated with PD in the joint meta-analysis ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) and the 24 previously reported PD loci using the PDWBS study. For each locus, SNPs within 500 kb of the index SNP (the SNP with the most significant P value) were tested for association by the same methods as described above for the PDWBS GWAS with the index SNP added as an additional covariate.

We used LD score regression (LDSC) 50 , 51 to compute the narrow-sense heritability ( h 2 ) estimates of PD in the PDWBS GWAS data (described above). Several methods exist for estimating h 2 with GWAS data 50 – 52 . We used LDSC to estimate h 2 in this study because it requires only summary-level data and is more computationally efficient for larger data sets. Reference LD scores were computed with the European ancestry subset of the 1000 Genomes data for SNPs within 500 kb of the SNP to be scored. Strict filtering was applied to ensure the robustness of heritability estimates as recommended 50 , 51 . After filtering, Z -scores for 7,629,099 SNPs from the 23andMe study were used as input to LDSC. We further used the stratified LD-score regression approach to partition heritability into 24 different cell-type-agnostic annotation categories including conserved regions, histone marks, DNase I hypersensitivity sites, ENCODE chromatin states, and enhancers 51 , as well as 10 different cell-type-specific histone annotations. Significant enrichment was assessed at a strict Bonferroni threshold of 0.0021 (0.05/24) for the 24 general categories, and 0.005 for the cell-type-specific enrichment.

Data were downloaded from the EBI-NHGRI catalog15 (version available on 17 April 2016). If a variant in the meta-analysis was within 500 kb and in LD ( r 2 > 0.8) with an association ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) in the catalog, the meta-analysis signal was considered to be overlapping the reported signal.

Associated index SNPs were paired to candidate genes on the basis of two broad levels of evidence: variant-level support and gene-level support (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for a graphic representation). In the former category, index SNPs were paired with candidate genes if there was evidence that the index SNP or an SNP in LD ( r 2 > 0.6) with the index SNP was annotated with a putative high-impact variant (chromosome number variation, exon loss variant, frame-shift variant, rare amino acid variant, splice donor or acceptor variant, start-lost, stop-gained or stop-lost, and transcript ablation) or moderate-impact variant (3′ or 5′ UTR truncation and exon loss, coding sequence variant, disruptive in-frame deletion or insertion, in-frame deletion or insertion, missense variant, regulatory region ablation, splice region variant, and transcription factor binding-site ablation). We obtained variant annotations by running SnpEff 53 on dbSNP build 142. A second source of variant-level support consisted of cis -eQTL evidence. Cis -eQTLs as pre-computed by GTEx (v6) 28 were downloaded directly from the GTEx portal (“URLs”). Although eQTL results were available for 46 tissues, including ten regions from the brain, our search for eQTLs was limited by the sampled tissues and cell types, and therefore we might have missed any eQTLs that are cell-type or tissue specific, in addition to eQTLs that are present only under certain stimuli (for example, ‘response’ eQTLs). The index SNP was tested for significant association with any gene where the TSS was within 250 kb of the index SNP. As roughly 90% of eQTLs are within 250 kb of a gene 28 , it is likely that we captured the majority of eQTLs while missing rarer, more distal events. For brain eQTLs, a strict Bonferroni correction was applied to the raw eQTL P values to adjust for multiple testing of genes within 250 kb of the index SNP. For other tissues, only eQTLs with a false discovery rate of <0.05 as determined by GTEx 28 were considered. We weighted brain and non-brain eQTLs equally.

Gene-level support was used when an index SNP had no candidate genes supported by variant-level data as described above. A list of genes within 250 kb of the index SNP was obtained (gene models used by GTEx were downloaded from the GTEx portal), and each gene was scored for neurological relevant features or annotations. Genes were first weighted for neurological relevant phenotypic annotations. Genes were (i) scored for being differentially expressed between PD patients and healthy controls (see Supplementary Note 1 for further details) (311 genes total genome-wide); (ii) annotated with ‘neuro’-associated phenotypes in FlyBase 54 (1,521 genes); (iii) scored for behavioral, neurological, and olfactory phenotypes annotated in MGI55 (3,890 genes); and (iv) annotated with any phenotypes related to neurological disorders or the brain in OMIM 56 (521 genes). Lastly, genes were scored for being expressed (median expression across samples > 2 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) in any cohort of GTEx brain region samples (15,197 genes) or in at least one brain cell type in the mouse expression data set 29 (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, or oligodendrocyte) (12,092 genes). For the gene-level support, we used a tiered scoring scheme to weight phenotypic annotations more heavily than expression in the brain (scores demarked in Supplementary Fig. 4 ) to enrich for genes with demonstrated neurological related roles. At each locus, the gene (or tied genes) with the highest score was nominated as the candidate gene for the region.

All protein-coding genes within 250 kb of PD-associated loci ( Supplementary Table 13 ) were used as input to STRING 57 . Gene pairs that were either coexpressed or involved in experimentally validated protein–protein interactions with a medium score or higher (score ≥ 0.4) are reported in Supplementary Table 10 .

Previously reported PD loci and novel PD associations were tested for enrichment in particular pathways or gene sets. First, the nominated candidate genes for these PD-associated loci were tested for enrichment in several targeted gene sets by a hypergeometric test. The background list of genes for comparison was matched to the neurological-centric candidate-gene nomination pipeline. The background list thus consisted of genes that had mouse knockout phenotypes, had fly mutant phenotypes, had OMIM-related phenotype annotations, had nominally significant cis -eQTLs in GTEx, were differentially expressed in PD patients versus controls, and were expressed in GTEx brain tissue or mouse brain cell types in the Barres data set.

We obtained mitochondrial genes from MitoMiner 58 using the MitoCarta 59 , 60 reference set after excluding genes that mapped to the mitochondria (genes that map to the mitochondria were not included in this metaanalysis). Lysosomal genes were obtained from the hlGDB 61 using only the proteomics and literature resources. Finally, we obtained autophagy genes from the Human Autophagy Database 62 , as well as ten additional genes reported in a recent siRNA screen of autophagic flux modulators 35 . A list of all genes in each pathway is provided in Supplementary Note 1 . The minimum P value per gene (for genes that an SNP within the 9,830 variants assayed in this meta-analysis mapped to) is provided in Supplementary Tables 14–16 .

Second, we applied a non-targeted gene-set enrichment approach using INRICH 36 to assess whether regions associated with PD were enriched for genes in KEGG 63 and Gene Ontology (GO) 64 gene sets. The 24 previously reported PD index variants and the 17 novel PD-associated variants reported in this study were used as input into PLINK’s 65 “show-tags” function. The European 1000 Genomes 12 samples were used for reference LD patterns. An interval for each PD-associated variant was defined as the region from the leftmost tag variant to the rightmost tag variant in the 1000 Genomes data.

We ran INRICH on these 41 intervals with the default settings, with the exception of increasing the number of replicates and bootstraps to 5,000 (-r 5000 --q 5000) and setting the pre-compute feature to false for software stability (-c). Enrichment for KEGG and GO gene sets was assessed separately.
