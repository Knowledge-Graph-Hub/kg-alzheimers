# Title
Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer

# Abstract
Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing 1 – 3 . However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence 4 , 5 , a form of terminal cell cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses 6 . The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway, leading to both short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogene and chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.

## Methods
Primary IMR90 and BJ fibroblasts were described previously and were authenticated by genome-wide sequencing analyses 5 , 7 . The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and were intermittently tested for mycoplasma. The cells were cultured under physiological oxygen (3%), and were used within population doubling of 35, except for replicative senescence experiments. For etoposide-induced senescence, IMR90 cells at ~60–70% confluency were treated with 100 uM etoposide for 48 h. The media were then replaced and cells were harvested at Day 7. For BJ cells, 40 uM etoposide were added to the culture media throughout the treatment. IMR90 stably expressing ER:HRas was described previously 5 . Senescence-associated β-galactosidase was performed as previously described 5 , 31 . dsDNA90 was described elsewhere 32 , and transfected using lipofectamine 2000; transfected cells were harvested 1 day post transfection for analysis of interferon β and 4 days for pro-inflammatory cytokines.

STING +/+ and STING −/− mice in C57BL/6 background were described elsewhere 15 . Mice were fed ad libitum on a regular diet, and all procedures were approved and performed following institutional regulations and guidelines (University of Pennsylvania and University of Glasgow). Both sexes were included in the study. Hydrodynamic tail vein injection was performed as previously described 33 . Briefly, 20 ug of NRasV12/luciferase and 10 ug of transposase constructs were injected to mice that are 8 to 12-week-old in Ringer's solution that corresponds to 10% of the body weight (e.g., 2.0 ml for a 20 g mouse, but not over 2.5 ml if the mouse is more than 25 g) within 6 s. Mouse Sting cDNA was purchased from Origene and was cloned into the NRas/IRES/luciferase vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For in vivo luciferase imaging, luciferin was intraperitoneally injected to mice at 150 mg/kg body weight. The mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and imaged under an IVIS Spectrum imager every minute for a duration of 15 min. Images with peak signals were used for data analyses. Identical parameters were used for longitudinal study and for comparisons between the two cohorts of mice. For ionizing radiation, mice were subjected to a sub-lethal dose of 4 Gy irradiation, and were harvested 7 days post the procedure for IHC studies. Presented images of mice post IR are representative of no less than five mice per condition. Isolation of primary hepatocytes is described elsewhere 33 . Liver tumor studies were performed following institutional regulations and guidelines (University of Pennsylvania, animal protocol #805175). A maximal loss of 20% of body weight is considered as an endpoint. None of the experiments exceeded the limit. Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard procedure at the institutional histology core facilities and was scored in a double-blinded manner.

Etoposide, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, puromycin, and polybrene were purchased from Sigma. Hygromycin was from Gemini Bio Products, and luciferin was from PerkinElmer. Recombinant human IL1α protein (used at 20 ng/ml) was from R&D Systems, and p38 MAPK inhibitor from Selleck Chemicals.

The following antibodies were described previously: Flag, p16, Lamin B1, GAPDH, and GFP 5 . Other antibodies used include: γH2AX (Abcam #ab2893 and Cell Signaling Technology #9718), STING (Cell Signaling Technology #13647 and LSBio #LS-B7237), cGAS (Cell Signaling Technology #15102 and Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-245858), human IL1α (Abcam #ab9614), IL8 (Abcam #ab18672), p-ATM S1981 (Abcam #ab81292), p-p53 S15 (Cell Signaling Technology #9284), p-p65 S536 (Cell Signaling Technology #3033), p65 (Cell Signaling Technology 8242), NRas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-31), CD3 (Abcam #ab16669), Mac2 (BioLegend #125401), mouse IL1α (R&D Systems #AF-400), p21 (#sc-471), and H3 (Active Motif #39763).

Retroviral GFP, GFP-Lamin B1, WZL-HRasV12 constructs, and production of virus for stable expression was performed as previously described 5 . Retroviral constructs (including LPC-cGAS-Flag) were transfected to phoenix packaging cell line. Lentiviral pLKO constructs were transfected with packaging plasmids to HEK293T cells. Viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-µm filter, supplemented with 8 µg/ml polybrene, and mixed with trypsinized recipient cells. The infected cells were then selected with puromycin or hygromycin.

pLKO-based shRNA was from Sigma. The following shRNA were used: STING (TRCN0000163296: GCCCGGATTCGAACTTACAAT and TRCN0000161345: GTCCAGGACTTGACATCTTAA), cGAS (TRCN0000149984: CAACTACGACTAAAGCCATTT and TRCN0000128706: CGTGAAGATTTCTGCACCTAA), IFI16 (TRCN0000364688: GGAAACTCTGAAGATTGATAT and TRCN0000364735: CTGGATGTCATTGACGATAAT), and Lamin B1 (TRCN0000029269: CCAGGGAAGAACTGATGGAAA and TRCN0000029271: GCATGAGAATTGAGAGCCTTT).

STING (TRCN0000163296: GCCCGGATTCGAACTTACAAT and TRCN0000161345: GTCCAGGACTTGACATCTTAA), cGAS (TRCN0000149984: CAACTACGACTAAAGCCATTT and TRCN0000128706: CGTGAAGATTTCTGCACCTAA), IFI16 (TRCN0000364688: GGAAACTCTGAAGATTGATAT and TRCN0000364735: CTGGATGTCATTGACGATAAT), and Lamin B1 (TRCN0000029269: CCAGGGAAGAACTGATGGAAA and TRCN0000029271: GCATGAGAATTGAGAGCCTTT).

Western blotting was described previously 5 , with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% SDS, supplemented with 1:100 Halt Protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The lysates were briefly sonicated, and supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis using NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast gels (Life Technologies). For p-ATM S1981 blotting, cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with 1:100 Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and benzonase (Novagen) at 12.5 U/ml. The lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and supernatants were loaded. For immunoblotting of STING dimer, reducing reagent was not added to the lysates before loading. After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane, 5% milk in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) was used to block the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in TBST, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBST, each for 10 min, followed by incubation of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, in 5% milk/TBST. The membrane was washed again 3 times, and imaged by films or by a GE Amersham Imager 600.

Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously 5 . Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing two times, cells were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cells were washed four times with PBST, each for 10 min, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies), in 5% BSA/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed four times in PBST, incubated with 1 µg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min, and washed twice with PBS. The slides were mounted with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies), and imaged with Leica TCS SP8 fluorescent confocal microscope. Quantification of % positive cells of SAHF, p-ATM, IL8, γH2AX, and p65 was done under identical microscopy settings between samples. Cells with over 5 visible spots at the expected location were considered positive. Over 200 cells from 4 randomly-selected fields were analyzed.

mRNA from cells or tissues were extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), with a DNase I (Qiagen) digestion step to minimize genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription (RT) was done using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (ThermoFisher), and then quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the 7900HT Fast-Real-Time PCR platform (ABI). Results were normalized to GAPDH for human cells.

ChIP was described previously 5 with slight modification. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde diluted in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After glycin quenching, the cell pellets were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), and sonicated with a Covaris sonicator, resulting in chromatin fragments of 250 bp average size. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with the above buffer without SDS, and subjected to immunoprecipitations with 1 ug of p65 antibody or control IgG conjugated with Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were then washed 4 times with buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and 1 time with final wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl), followed by elution with incubation of elution buffer (final wash buffer plus 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min with agitation in a thermomixer. The ChIP and input were then purified and used for qPCR analysis. The following primers were used for qPCR of gene promoter regions: IL8: CCACCGGAAGGAACCATCT, GGCCAGCTTGGAAGTCATGT; IL6: CACCTGGAGACGCCTTGAAG, TGCCTGGCCATCCTCAAAT; MMP3: TGGATTTGCTGGTTCTTGAGG, TTTGTTCTATTCTGCCCATGAGG; β-actin: CTGGGTTTTATAGGGCGCC, AAGTTGCCTTTTATGGCTCGAG.

RNA-seq was performed as previously described 7 , 8 with modifications. Total RNA was isolated from IMR90 cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and 1 ug of RNA was used as input in the Scriptseq Complete kit (Epicentre). Briefly, total RNA was ribo-depleted using a Ribozero magnetic protocol (Epicentre). The ribo-depleted RNA was then ethanol-precipitated, fragmented, and tagged at both ends for stranded library preparation, using the Scriptseq v2 library preparation protocol. The PCR amplification step was used to index the libraries and multiplexed libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems). The RNA-seq run was performed on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina).

Single-ended, 75 bp reads were mildly trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.32) to remove leading or trailing nucleotides whose sequencing quality was below 3. Reads whose length fell below 30 bp after trimming were also removed from downstream analysis. STAR (version 2.3.0e) was used for mapping reads to reference genome (hg19), requiring a minimum alignment score of 10. The expression level of RefSeq genes was quantified using featureCounts (version 1.5.0) and normalized using DESeq2.

Gene expression of RNA-seq data were compared in log2-CPM (i.e. log2 read per million mapped reads) as reported by DESeq2. The average log2-CPM values were used for biological replicates. Genes with over three fold change in expression between etoposide-treated sh-NTC and sh-cGAS were uploaded to DAVID for GO analysis. Genes contributed to the top four down-regulated GO terms were combined with known SASP genes 34 for heatmap visualization, where expression of each gene was scaled to between 0 and 1 based on its minimum and maximum values in proliferating, etoposide-treated sh-NTC and sh-cGAS. SASP genes that are induced less than three-fold (comparing etoposide-treated sh-NTC and proliferating) and those that are not induced in IMR90 DNA damage conditions 34 are not included for the heatmap.

RNA-sequencing data were uploaded to GEO under accession number GSE99028.

For western and cytokine-array analysis of secreted cytokines, cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 h. The cultured media were then collected, and the cell numbers were counted for normalization. The media were filtered with a 0.45 µm PVDF filter (Millipore) to remove cells and debris. The resulting supernatant was further concentrated with a 3kDa Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filter (Millipore), and was subjected to immunoblotting of IL8 or cytokine-array assay (RayBiotech, Human Cytokine Array C1) following manufacturer’s guidelines. The intensities of array dots were quantified with Fiji and were normalized against the positive controls on the blots.

Extraction of chromatin fragments was described previously 35 with modifications. Briefly, proliferating IMR90 cells were incubated with hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% NP40), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, on ice for 10 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 300 g, 4 °C, for 3 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the resulting pellets were incubated with benzonase buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) with protease inhibitor cocktail, supplemented with 10 U of benzonase, on ice, for 30 min. The product was centrifuged again at 300 g, 4 °C, for 3 min, and benzonase was inactivated by addition of 15 mM EDTA. The resulting supernatant contains chromatin fragments and soluble nuclear proteins. The product was then diluted 5 times with PBS. As a control, buffer without benzonase was used, which yielded soluble nuclear proteins but no chromatin fragments. The chromatin fragments or the control were transfected to proliferating IMR90 cells using lipofectamine 2000. Successful transfection was confirmed by immunofluorescence with an H3 antibody and DAPI. Transfected cells were harvested 4 days post transfection, and were analyzed by RT-qPCR for cytokine production.

cGAMP extraction was performed as reported by Chen et al 36 , with slight modifications. IMR90 cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes, and the culture media were removed and replaced with 2 ml 80:20 methanol:water. The dishes were incubated at −80 °C overnight, and cells were scraped, subjected to 2 vortex, freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and sonicated in a Bioruptor sonicator in ice water bath. The product was clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was concentrated by a SpeedVac concentrator and subjected to sample clean-up and LC-MS analysis. For mouse hepatocytes and liver, tissues were homogenized in 80:18:2 methanol:water:acetic acid, and were processed similarly as afore-mentioned. The pellets from the centrifugation step were dissolved in 1% SDS followed by sonication, and the concentration of proteins were measured by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit, allowing normalization to total proteins.

Dried supernatants were re-suspended in 50 µL 0.1% acetic acid and subjected to solid phase extraction. Briefly, the bottom of a P200 pipette tip was sealed with a small disk of C18 material (Millipore). To the pipette tip, 200 µL of phenyl-hexyl resin (5 µm, 100 Å, Phenomenex) resuspended in acetonitrile was added. A centrifuge adaptor was used to hold stage-tips in place in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. The resin was flushed with 50 µL of acetonitrile by slow centrifugation. The resin was then equilibrated with 50 µL of 0.1% acetic acid and samples were loaded onto the equilibrated resin. Samples were washed once with 0.1% acetic acid and eluted into a clean microcentrifuge tube by flushing 50 µL of 20 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid twice. Samples were collected, dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 0.1 % formic acid for LC-MS analysis.

LC-MS analysis was carried out using an EASY-nLC nano HPLC (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), equipped with a nano-electrospray source. Ionization source parameters were optimized using a 2’3’- cGAMP standard (InvivoGen) and set to: positive mode; capillary temperature, 275 °C; spray voltage, 2.3kV. Analytes were separated on an in-house analytical column (150 µm ID, 370 mm length) packed with a phenyl-hexyl resin 5 µm, 100 Å (Phenomenex). The mobile phases were 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (B). Analytes were eluted using the following gradient: 0 – 20% B in 20 min, 20 – 98% B in 5 min and maintained over 10 min at 600 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was set to perform a full MS scan (300 – 700 m/z) in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z), followed by targeted MS/MS scans of the precursor ion of cGAMP (m/z = 675.10 [M + H] 1+ ). Fragment ions were scanned from 185 – 700 m/z. All MS/MS scans were performed in the orbitrap mass analyzer (15,000 resolution) using HCD fragmentation (collision energy = 25), and an isolation window of 1.0 m/z. Maximum injection times of 50 and 100 ms were defined for MS and MS/MS scans, respectively. AGC values were set to 5 × 10 5 for MS and 5 × 10 4 for MS/MS. MS data were collected in profile mode and MS/MS data were collected in centroid mode.

The results of TCGA were based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.gov . For TCGA analyses, RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from cBioportal ( www.cbioportal.org ). For a given cancer type, tumor samples were ranked based on their targeted gene expression values, and were evenly divided into four groups accordingly. Statistical comparisons were then performed between the first group (samples with the lowest 25% expression) and the last group (samples with the highest 25% expression) for inflammatory genes or the house-keeping gene (GAPDH), as denoted. Similarly, for analyses of the CCLE samples, RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from the Broad Institute data portal ( www.portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home ). The samples were ranked as described above for TCGA samples, and likewise, comparisons were carried out between the first group and the last group for inflammatory genes or GAPDH. For box plots displayed in this study, the central rectangle spans a range from the first quartile to the third quartile (this range is also known as the interquartile range, IQR). A line inside the rectangle shows the median. Outliers were defined as data points that are either 1.5×IQR or more above the third quartile or 1.5×IQR or more below the first quartile. If either type of outlier is present, the whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5×IQR from the quartile rather than the maximum or minimum. Outliers were not displayed in the box plots, but all data points were included in P-value calculations. One-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compute statistical significance. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for comparison between two groups. One-way ANOVA coupled with Tukey’s post hoc test was used for comparisons over two groups. All bar graphs show mean values with error bars (s.d. or s.e.m., as defined in figure legends), unless specified otherwise. 95% confidence intervals were used, and significance was considered when p value was less than 0.05.
