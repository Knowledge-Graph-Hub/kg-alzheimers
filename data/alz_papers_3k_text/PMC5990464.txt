Atomic Structures of Segments from TDP-43 LCD and insight into Reversible and Pathogenic Aggregation

# Abstract
The normally soluble TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) is found aggregated both in reversible stress granules and irreversible pathogenic amyloid. In TDP-43, the low complexity domain (LCD) is believed to be involved in both types of aggregation. To discover the structural origins of these two modes of β-sheet rich aggregation, we have determined ten structures of segments of the LCD of human TDP-43. Six of these segments form steric zippers characteristic of the spines of pathogenic amyloid fibrils; four others form LARKS, the labile amyloid-like interactions characteristic of protein hydrogels and proteins found in membrane-less organelles, including stress granules. Supporting a hypothetical pathway from reversible to irreversible amyloid aggregation, we found that familial ALS variants of TDP-43 convert LARKS to irreversible aggregates. Our structures suggest how TDP-43 adopts both reversible and irreversible β-sheet aggregates, and the role of mutation in the possible transition of reversible to irreversible pathogenic aggregation.

## Introduction
The role of low complexity domains (LCDs) in proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases is a topic of intense current investigation 1 – 3 . LCDs are regions of proteins that exhibit biased compositions of amino acids and frequently no secondary structure 4 – 6 . In some cases the LCDs are the result of nucleotide expansions that cause duplications of short sequences, as in Huntington’s Disease 7 . In other cases the LCDs are intrinsic to the protein and believed to have a functional role as in the RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), Fused in sarcoma (FUS) and hnRNPA1 8 , whose LCDs participate in formation of stress granules 1 , 9 , 10 .

Stress granules (SGs) are aggregates of RNA and RNA binding proteins that form in the cytoplasm when the cell experiences physical, mechanical or chemical stress 11 , 12 . This process is often initiated by a halt in translation and puts the cell in a hibernating state until the stress subsides 13 . SGs are reversible, meaning that SG-proteins disaggregate when the stress is relieved, the disaggregated proteins and RNA are then free to return to their normal functions in the cell 1 , 2 , 14 , 15 . Phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in these SG-proteins dynamics 16 , 17 . Over the last decade, researchers have studied how this process occurs and what biophysical properties these aggregates exhibit. Recent studies on G3BP-1, a SG protein, have demonstrated that the SGs exist in a biphasic state with the mRNA packed at the center and the RNA-binding proteins on the periphery 18 . Also, foci composed entirely of RNA have been observed as a product of phase transition in human cells 19 . The mechanism of SGs assembly and the role of RNA are still being investigated 1 , 3 , 15 , 20 . Studies on FUS and hnRNPA1 have demonstrated that the LCDs are sufficient for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 1 , 15 . Despite progress, questions remain about the structures of the aggregates and how these may differ between SG assemblies and pathogenic states 4 .

Our recent study determined atomic structures of five segments of low-complexity domains of FUS, hnRNPA1, and nup98 21 . All of these displayed kinked β-sheets with weak interactions between sheets. We gave these structures the acronym LARKS (Low-complexity Aromatic-Rich Kinked Segments), and proposed that these LARKS act as Velcro to provide adhesion between LCDs to form SGs or other membrane-less organelle assemblies. These structures contrast with steric-zippers which act as molecular glue to fasten together amyloidogenic segments in amyloid fibrils(reviewed in 22 ). Our study of LARKS offered an atomic-resolution hypothesis about the molecular mechanism of SG formation.

In addition to studies aimed at determining the structure of SG assemblies, researchers have focused on the role of SG-associated proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. One of the major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases is the deposition of proteinaceous amyloid fibrils in cells 23 . Different from SG assembly, aggregation of proteins into the amyloid state in disease seems a virtually irreversible process 22 , 24 . Variants found in TDP-43, FUS and hnRNPA-1 have all been linked to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) among other diseases 25 .

TAR DNA Binding Protein (TDP-43) is a 43kD protein composed of four domains: an N-terminal domain, two RNA recognition domains and a C-terminal low complexity domain (LCD) 26 – 28 . This protein is involved in a number of cellular functions including mRNA shuttling, transcription, miRNA processing and alternative splicing among others 29 , 30 . Over the past decade, research into TDP-43 has found aggregates of the protein in patients with ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Huntington’s Disease 31 – 34 . These aggregates are irreversible, ubiquitinated, hyper-phosphorylated, C-terminal cleavage products ranging in size from 25–35kD 35 . Thus it is hypothesized that the LCD of TDP-43 plays a role in both this irreversible disease aggregation and reversible SG aggregation.

Of proteins that participate in SGs and also form pathogenic amyloid fibrils, TDP-43 stands out for four reasons. First, TDP-43 has over 45 variants that are linked to ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases 25 , 36 , 37 . Second, the majority of the variants that cause disease are localized to the LCD 38 , 39 . Third, the majority of the aggregates found in the cytoplasm of cells of patients are cleavage products inclusive of the LCD 40 , 41 . Finally, TDP-43 is found to aggregate in 97% of sporadic cases and 45% of familial case of ALS 42 , 43 . This makes TDP-43 an intriguing candidate for understanding how its LCD participates in both reversible SG assembly and irreversible, pathogenic assembly.

Through structure determination, we can learn which segments of TDP-43 may drive aggregation and how familial variants affect this process. Here we use x-ray diffraction and micro-electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the atomic resolution structures of ten peptide segments, seven in the reference sequence and three variants, from the LCD of TDP-43. We show that the LCD is capable of forming typical steric-zipper β-sheet structures characteristic of pathogenic aggregation. Also we show that segment 312–317 forms a kinked, labile structure—a LARKS, predicted as a protein interaction motif consistent with properties of SG assemblies 21 . We also show how this structure is perturbed by the familial mutants A315T and A315E, which provides an opportunity for understanding the interplay of formation of membrane-less organelles with pathogenic amyloid.

## Results
For structural studies we targeted segments throughout the LCD because there is no consensus of which region is the amyloidogenic core. The LCD of TDP-43 is an unstructured domain composed of approximately 140 amino acid residues. Researchers have demonstrated that this region plays a role in aberrant mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm in mice and neuroblastoma cell lines 44 , 45 . It was initially suggested that the entire LCD, residues 277–414, served as a prion like domain and was the minimum fragment required for aggregation 46 . However, additional studies suggested smaller regions within the LCD are sufficient for aggregation and neurodegeneration. In the first study, segment 286–331 was identified and shown to form amyloid fibrils and confer neurotoxicity on primary cortical neurons 47 . A second study identified residues 311–360, illustrating through NMR and CD studies that this segment undergoes a helix to β-sheet transition that initiates aggregation and cytoplasmic inclusion 48 , 49 . A third study suggested that segment 342–366 is the minimum toxic core that transitions from a random coil to a β-sheet 50 . In short, these studies illustrated that there are several regions of the LCD that can be responsible for amyloid-like aggregation.

Our previous studies demonstrated that adhesive cores of amyloid fibrils are composed of 6–11-residue segments that stack together as steric-zippers 22 , 51 . To identify which segments from the LCD of TDP-43 might be responsible for TDP-43 aggregation, we consulted ZipperDB 52 , (URL: https://services.mbi.ucla.edu/zipperdb ). We selected the top 10 hits scored by their adhesive energies ( supplementary table 1 ). Additionally, we also selected segments rich in glutamine and asparagine because the C-terminus of TDP-43 is a prion-like sequence and these two residues are important for prion aggregation 53 , 54 . Lastly, we selected two segments based on a double mutation reported to reduce TDP-43 aggregation 48 (see methods and materials section for detailed segment selection), In total, we targeted fifteen segments in the LCD of TDP-43 ( supplementary table 1 ).

Crystal structures revealed that six of the segments formed steric-zippers: 300 GNNQGSN 306 , 321 AMMAAA 326 , 328 AALQSS 333 , 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 , 370 GNNSYS 375 , and 396 GFNGGFG 402 ( Fig. 1A and B , Table 1 ). These structures demonstrated tight side chain interdigitation, like the previously reported zippers in other amyloidogenic proteins, such as β-amyloid 51 and Tau 55 . All three six structures are composed of in-register sheets 22 . Segments 321 AMMAAA 326 and 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 form anti-parallel sheets ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) while the other four segments form parallel sheets.

Segments 300 GNNQGSN 306 , 328 AALQSS 333 and 370 GNNSYS 375 all form Class 1 steric zippers in which the β-sheets are mated face-to-face with the same edges of the sheet oriented up the fibril ( Fig. 1B ) 22 , 51 . These Class 1 structures have two distinct interfaces (labeled as IF1 and IF2 in Fig.1B ). Segments 321 AMMAAA 326 and 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 are Class 7 steric zippers with face-to-back and up-up orientation. Segment 396 GFNGGFG 402 forms a Class 4 steric zipper with face-to-back β-sheets and up-down orientation ( Fig. 1B ) 51 . These Class 7 and Class 4 structures have one unique interface. The area buried (Ab) and shape complementary (Sc) of all interfaces are labeled in Fig. 1B 51 .

To investigate the connection between our steric-zipper structures and the pathogenic aggregates of TDP-43, we designed mutations to disrupt the zipper structures and tested their influence on aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. The segment we chose to represent pathogenic TDP-43 aggregation contains residues D-414 because it is a pathogenic segment of TDP-43 that was identified from FTLD brains 40 . We term this segment TDP-CTF, where CTF stands for C-terminal fragment. We disrupted steric-zipper formation by substituting tryptophan at the central residue of the sheet-sheet interface; its bulk imposes steric hindrance. We designed 8 mutations, Q303W and G304W targeting interface 2 and 1 of 300 GNNQGSN 306 , respectively; A324W targeting the interface of 321 AMMAAA 326 ; L330W and Q331W targeting interfaces 1 and 2 of 328 AALQSS 333 , respectively; M337W targeting the interface of 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 ; S373W targeting interface 2 of 370 GNNSYS 375 ; and G399W targeting the interface of 396 GFNGGFG 402 .We did not design a mutation in interface 1 of 370 GNNSYS 375 , since the interaction is relatively weak as judged by its small area buried.

Our mutagenesis results indicate that all six short segments are important for TDP-43-CTF aggregation. We achieved an aggregate-free starting point by conjugating TDP-CTF wild type and its mutants with a SUMO tag ( Fig.2a , top panel). Aggregation was initiated by ULP1 protease removal of the SUMO tag ( Supplementary Fig.2 ). After 30 min of incubation on ice approximately half of the SUMO-free TDP-CTF aggregated, as judged by the pellet fraction after centrifugation ( Fig.2a , middle panel). In contrast, most of the SUMO-free mutants remained soluble, except G304W. After overnight incubation, cleavage of the SUMO-tag was nearly complete and all SUMO-free TDP-CTF wild type was in the pellet ( Fig.2a , bottom panel). However, aggregation was incomplete for several mutants, displaying soluble TDP-CTF mutant material in the supernatant, including Q330W, A324W, M337W, L330W, Q331W and G399W. These results indicate that interface 2 of 300 GNNQGSN 306 , the interface of 321 AMMAAA 326 , interfaces 1 and 2 of 328 AALQSS 333 , the interface of 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 , interface 2 of 370 GNNSYS 375 , and the interface of 396 GFNGGFG 402 are important for pathogenic aggregation of TDP-43. Potentially, these segments could facilitate pathogenic aggregation of wild type TDP-43 by forming the same steric-zipper structures we report here. Three of these zippers are located within the region 318–343, previously identified as the amyloidogenic core essential for TDP-43 aggregation 48 . This correlation is significant given that it covers a relatively small region compared to the whole LCD (26 residues out of 140). Moreover, a previous discovery that the double mutation A324E-M337E reduces TDP-43 aggregation 48 is consistent with our expectation that these substitutions create steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, thereby disrupting steric-zipper interfaces of 321 AMMAAA 326 and 333 SWGMMGMLASQ 343 . These results suggest that these segments are important for pathogenic aggregation of TDP-43, and the steric-zipper structures we report here may represent the structure of the aggregation core.

To further validate the role of these segments in TDP-43 aggregation, we compared the fibril diffraction of the low complexity domain of TDP-43 with the simulated diffraction of the zipper structures. We carried out fibril diffraction on TDP-LCD that contains residues 274–414 and was expressed using the same SUMO-tag strategy employed previously ( Supplementary Fig.2 ). TDP-LCD formed long extended amyloid-like fibrils around 15 nm in diameter ( Fig.2B ), similar to the fibrils formed by TDP-43 in ALS patients 41 . The fibril diffraction pattern shows the rings at 10 Å and 4.8 Å, the signature feature of amyloid fibrils 22 . In comparison, electron micrographs of the six zipper-forming segments reveal microcrystals ( Fig. 2B ). We have shown these crystals are composed of cross-β assemblies. That is, the architecture revealed by the crystal structures of the segments is consistent with the cross-β signature of the TDP-LCD. Simulated fibril diffraction patterns calculated from their crystal structures are comparable with experimental diffraction of the TDP-LCD fibril ( Fig. 2B ); the differences correspond to variation in sheet-to-sheet distance among segments.

In addition to pathogenic aggregation, TDP-43 is also involved in functional aggregation, such as SG formation. In SG assembly, the LCDs of SG-proteins are reported to be the key regions responsible for this reversible aggregation 1 – 3 . To further explore the role of the LCD in the functional aggregation of TDP-43, we focused on segments that have the potential to contribute to SG formation. The McKnight laboratory previously discovered that glycine residues flanked by aromatic side chains are features of hydrogel formation of the LCD of the protein FUS 2 . The hydrogel they studied is a reversible aggregate formed in vitro composed of reversible amyloid fibrils that trap a large amount of water, and is potentially relevant to SG formation in vivo 56 . They showed that replacement of aromatic residues in the LCD disrupted this hydrogel formation 2 , which led to the hypothesis that aromatic residues play a role in SG assembly. For this reason, our recent study focused on the segments of the LCD of SG proteins that contain an aromatic residue and two proximal small or polar residues 21 . Structural studies of these segments in FUS and hnRNPA1 revealed pairs of kinked sheets, defined as LARKS (Low complexity, Aromatic-Rich, Kinked Segments), that display weak van der Waals interactions between mating sheets. Further research suggests the connection of LARKS with protein adhesion of LCDs in reversible aggregation formation 21 .

In the present study, we find 312 NFGAFS 317 , in the LCD of TDP-43, has similar amino acid composition and also forms labile aggregates and LARKS ( Fig. 3 ). This suggests that TDP-43 can adopt the same mechanism of SG-formation previously hypothesized for FUS and hnRNPA1. Under EM, 312 NFGAFS 317 forms microcrystals ( Fig. 3A ). These microcrystals are labile, meaning they fully dissolve when treated with ≥1% SDS and heat to 70°C for 15 minutes. Their lability was observed by diminished turbidity ( Fig. 3B ). This behavior is similar to hydrogels formed by LCDs of SG-proteins, which re-solubilize by treatment with SDS and heat 2 , unlike pathogenic amyloid fibrils such as β-amyloid fibrils ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ). The structure of 312 NFGAFS 317 reveals a kinked backbone ( Fig. 3C ), similar to other LARKS 21 . The kink occurs at Phe316 and has a Ramachandran angles of a left-handed α-helix. The kinked backbone makes two phenylalanine residues at positions 2 and 5 face the same side of the sheet, whereas a canonical β-sheet places the odd numbered sidechains on one face and the even numbered sidechains on the opposite face 51 . The subsequent packing of mating strands creates two different interfaces. Here we see that all the aromatic residues pack near to each other creating a hydrophobic, aromatic interface. The other interface is held together by the hydrogen-bonded interactions of the asparagine side chains. Both interfaces are weaker than most zipper structures as indicated by the relative low surface area buried, and consistent with the observation that these assemblies are labile under treatment with SDS and heat.

We observe that 312 NFGAFS 317 forms a LARKS structure and its microcrystalline aggregates are labile, thus providing another example of LARKS with a potential role in SG formation, and an opportunity to investigate the influence of pathogenic variants of the putative key segment of functional aggregation. Within the NFGAFS segment, there are two ALS-linked familial variants: A315T and A315E 47 , 57 . Both of these variants have been shown to increase redistribution of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm and increase neuronal death as compared to the reference sequence 58 – 61 . Additionally, previous studies have shown that disease-causing mutations in SG-proteins are associated with accumulation of persistent SGs 62 – 64 . However the molecular mechanism of transformation of SGs to irreversible aggregates has remained elusive. Here we studied the structure and biochemical behavior of 312 NFGTFS 31 , 312 NFGEFS 317 , and 312 NFGpTFS 317 where pT stands for phosphorylated threonine. We studied 312 NFGpTFS 317 because TDP-43 is found to be hyperphosphorylated in ALS patients 35 , and the A315T mutation may create a new phosphorylation site in vivo .

All three of these mutant segments formed microcrystals under EM ( Fig. 3A ). 312 NFGEFS 317 and 312 NFGpTFS 317 aggregates were irreversible under the same SDS and heat denaturing assay as 312 NFGAFS 317 . 312 NFGTFS 317 aggregates, however, were still labile ( Fig. 3B ). These results indicated that the stabilities of the mutant segments A315E and A315pT were significantly enhanced as compared to that of 312 NFGAFS 317 .

To better understand the biochemical findings, we determined the structures of all three mutant segments. All three structures are composed of kinked, in-register, parallel sheets; however the kink positions differ. In 312 NFGAFS 317 the kink occurs at Phe316. In the case of 312 NFGTFS 317 and 312 NFGEFS 317 , the kink occurs at Gly314; and the 312 NFGpTFS 317 structure is kinked at two residues, Phe313 and Gly314. Despite the different positions of the kinks, all of the kinks result in the two phenylalanine residues facing the same side of the sheet ( Fig. 3C ).

Further analysis of the structures illustrates that the packing of sheets in both 312 NFGTFS 317 and 312 NFGpTFS 317 are face-to-face, as in 312 NFGAFS 31 . Both have two distinct interfaces of mating strands, one dry interface formed by hydrophobic residues (mainly phenylalanine residues, labeled as IF1 in Fig. 3C ) and one wet interface formed by mostly hydrophilic residues (labeled as IF2 in Fig. 3C ). The packing of 312 NFGEFS 317 is face-to-back so its two interfaces are identical, with hydrophobic interactions in the middle and hydrophilic interactions on both sides. For the 312 NFGpTFS 317 structure, the phosphate is clearly observed in the Fo-Fc omit map ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ). To our knowledge, this is the first time a post-translational modification has been reported for an amyloid mimetic structure. The enhanced stability of the A315E and A315pT of 312 NFGAFS 317 assemblies can be explained by the increased interface strengths, indicated by area buried for the dry interface and hydrogen network of the wet interface. The area buried for the dry interface increased significantly from 63.0 Å 2 /chain in 312 NFGAFS 317 to 137.0 Å 2 /chain in 312 NFGEFS 317 and 175.6 Å 2 /chain in 312 NFGpTFS 317 ( Fig. 3C ). In the case of 312 NFGpTFS 317 , increased buried area results from the four phenylalanine residues of two strands perfectly interdigitating with each other. Additionally, on the wet interface, the side chains of Glu315 and pThr315 create a hydrogen bonding network, which further strengthens the assembly ( Supplementary Fig. 3C ). This stacking of negatively charged Glu315 and pThr315 is facilitated by the acidic pH of crystallization conditions, in which the residual TFA from peptide synthesis significantly decreases the pH, and results in partially protonated glutamate and P-threonine side chains (see discussion). For 312 NFGTFS 317 , the area buried for dry interface and hydrogen network for the wet interface is similar that of 312 NFGAFS 317 , which is consistent with the observation that 312 NFGTFS 317 has similar behavior in our denaturing assay as 312 NFGAFS 317 .

In summary, we find that the 312 NFGAFS 317 segment of TDP-43 forms a kinked β-sheet structure—a LARKS—which is labile. We find that two familial variants within this segment, A315T and A315E, together with phosphorylation, strengthen the reference sequence assembly and making it irreversible by creating a more stable structure with stronger interaction between each the sheets. These results further support our hypothesis that LARKS are the potential molecular mechanism of functional, reversible aggregate formation, by showing that LARKS exist in another SG-forming protein, TDP-43. Moreover, these results indicate that the pathogenic mutations and or post-translational modifications can strengthen LARKS and drive SG-proteins towards pathogenic aggregation.

## Discussion
Our previous studies suggested connections of cross-β structures to both amyloid aggregation through steric-zippers forming irreversible pathogenic fibrils 22 and LARKS forming reversible hydrogels and possibly membrane-less organelles 21 . In this study, we determined structures of segments from the LCD of TDP-43 and found that that this domain has the capacity to form both steric-zippers and LARKS. This is consistent with the dual nature of the TDP-43 LCD which can drive aggregation of the protein into either functional SG aggregates or into pathogenic amyloid fibrils as in ALS or FTLD. In Figure 4 we present a speculative model that incorporates our findings and explains how SG assembly might lead to pathogenic assembly. In physiological conditions, TDP-43 can execute its normal functions without irreversible aggregation, even though steric-zipper (red bars) and LARKS (kinked blue bars) segments exist in their sequences ( Fig. 4 , top panel). In pathogenic conditions, the steric-zipper forming segments interact with each other to form irreversible assemblies, driving the protein into pathogenic amyloid fibrils ( Fig. 4 , left pathway). In stress conditions, the LARKS forming segments interact with each other to form reversible assemblies and drive the protein to functional aggregates such as SGs. Since functional assemblies are reversible 1 , 2 , 14 , the aggregation of proteins can be reversed when stress is relieved ( Fig. 4 , right pathway). Numerous factors are believed to influence the fate of the proteins, including intra/inter-cellular signals, chaperones, RNA binding, protein folding, microenvironments such as pH, protein concentration, etc. Here, our study suggests that the mutations and or post-translational modifications can also change the pathway of assembly by directly changing the character of assembly-driving segments ( Fig. 4 , middle pathway). As exemplified by A315E and A315pT, the mutation and phosphorylation strengthen the 312 NFGAFS 317 assembly, converting a labile LARKS to irreversible aggregates. Our hypothesis is that under conditions that favor SGs, LARKS segments interact with each other, and should one or more of them convert to an irreversible structure, the protein may form a pathological, irreversible assembly.

The mechanism represented in Figure 4 may apply for other regions of TDP-43 and other SG-forming proteins. The 312 NFGAFS 317 segment is not the only region proposed to be important for reversible aggregation of TDP-43; residues 320–340 have been reported to be involved in granule formation 3 , 65 . Applying a threading algorithm for predicting LARKS from amino acid sequence, we predicted additional LARKS in the LCD of TDP-43 21 . We compared the LARKS predictions with the familial variants reported on TDP-43 LCD, and found that 28 out of 42 reported familial variants are in the regions of predicted LARKS ( supplementary table 2 ). This observation supports our hypothesis that the mechanism of conversion of A315E and A315pT on 312 NFGAFS 317 may be a general mechanism.

Notice that both 312 NFGEFS 317 and 312 NFGpTFS 317 crystals were grown at acidic pH, which facilitated the stacking of glutamate and phosphorylated threonine residues. A recent study also shows that decrease in pH drives phase separation in yeast and in in vitro systems 66 . This observation suggests the importance of pH on SG formation and the role of pH in transition of SG to pathogenic aggregation.

In this study, we also reported six steric-zipper structures from LCD of TDP-43, and showed the connection between these structures with pathogenic aggregates of TDP-43 by mutagenesis experiments. The observation that all six segments are important for TDP-43 aggregation, suggests a segmental polymorphism, meaning the aggregation of TDP-43 can be formed via multiple cores. Although recent structural studies have shown that the amyloid fibril core usually contains tens of residues (e.g. cryo-EM structures of Tau 67 ), our study on short peptides facilitates the research of amyloidogenic proteins by identifying the high-resolution structures of core aggregation-prone segments, and more importantly, by providing structural insights for inhibitor designs. By designing peptide inhibitors that bind to the ends of steric-zipper structures and cap their growth, we have successfully developed the inhibitors for aggregation of several amyloidogenic proteins, including p53 68 and Tau 55 . The zipper structures we reported here will provide the opportunity for structure-based design of TDP-43 inhibitors.

In summary, the present study provides atomic-resolution structures of irreversible and reversible aggregates of segments of TDP-43, and the possible roles of familial mutations and or post-translational modifications in the interconversion of these two distinct aggregation pathways.

## Online Methods
We chose our peptides of interest by a combination of computational prediction and literature reports ( supplementary table 1 ). For computational prediction, we selected the segments that contain high rank predictions from ZipperDB (ranked by the predicted Rosetta energy). From literature reports, we have selected the segments containing the features important for LCD aggregation. First, the LCD of TDP-43 is believed to be a prion-like domain, and glutamine and asparagine residues are found to be important for prion aggregation 53 , 54 , so we selected three segments from LCD of TDP-43 that have the highest Gln and Asn density. These three segments are GNNQGSN (4 out of 7), ASQQNQ (4 out of 6) and GNNQNQ (5 out of 6); the latter two were also identified by ZipperDB. Second, aromatic residues are reported to be important in LCD aggregation 2 , so we selected two segments from the LCD of TDP-43 that have multiple aromatic residues close to each other; these are NFGAFS (two residues between two phenylalanine residues) and GFNGGFG (three residues between two phenylalanine residues). Third, the A324E-M337E double mutation is reported to reduce TDP-43 aggregation 48 , so AMMAAA and SWGMMGMLASQ were selected to study the molecular mechanism of this double mutation. All peptides were purchased from Genscript at a purity of 95% or higher. Notice that from fifteen peptides we selected, we determined the structures for ten of them. The other segments we selected ( supplementary table 1 ), failed to generate structures because of poor crystal formation or poor quality of crystal diffraction.

All peptide segments were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 20mM. Samples were then incubated at 37°C in a Torrey Pine Scientific shaker at level 9 for 80 hours. Samples were examined by TEM following fibril formation.

TDP-CTF (208–414) was designed to mimic the pathological fragment of TDP-43 found in FTLD brain, and the low complexity domain of TDP-43 (TDP-LCD, 274–414) was also designed. Both TDP-43 fragments was conjugated to the carboxyl-terminus of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to increase its solubility and prevent its aggregation during expression and purification. The SUMO protein was also conjugated with (His) 6 -tag on its amino-terminus for easier purification. The SUMO-TDP constructs were inserted into a pET28a vector with following expressed sequences:

Both SUMO-TDP-CTF and SUMO-TDP-LCD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Bacterial cells were cultured in LB media supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25 °C for 3 hours. Cells were harvested and re-suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, supplemented with 1% (v/v) Halt Protease Inhibitor single-use cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The re-suspension solution was sonicated (3s on/3s off cycle, 10 mins) and the supernatant solution was collected after centrifugation (24,000 × g for 20 mins). The supernatant solution was mixed with homemade NucA nuclease (5000 U per liter of cell culture) and filtered before load to HisTrap HP column (GE health care). The HisTrap column was equalized with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole before loading of supernatant solution, and washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 200 mM Imidazole after loading. The protein expected was eluted by 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole and concentrated by Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (Millipore) to at least 2 mg/ml (10 fold higher than the working concentration of aggregation assays). SUMO-TDP-LCD was concentrated to 10 mg/ml (10 fold higher than its fibril formation concentration).

To validate the cleavage of SUMO-tag and existence of TDP fragment, purified SUMO-TDP-CTF and SUMO-TDP-LCD was diluted into 0.2 mg/ml with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT, mixed with 100:1 (weight basis) homemade ULP1 protease, and incubated on ice. Samples were taken before and 1 hour after adding ULP1 protease, and separated by NuPAGE 4–12% Bir-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The pellet of SUMO-TDP-LCD was also collected and sampled from fibril formation assay and loaded to the same gel. The SDS-PAGE was stained by coomassie blue, or probed with TDP-43 polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen, catalog number PA5-27221, 1:1000 dilution) and Anti-Rabbit IgG (whole molecule)-Peroxidase antibody (Sigma, catalog number A0545, 1:5000 dilution) after transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membrane was visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Thermo Scientific) and BIOMAX Light Film (Carestream).

SUMO-TDP-LCD was diluted into 1 mg/ml with the same dilution buffer used in aggregation assays of TDP-CTF, and mixed with 100:1 (weight basis) homemade ULP1 protease. The fibril was formed by shaking the solution at 37 °C for 3 days and sitting it on bench for another 2 days. The fibril was collected by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 5 mins and washed by water for 2 times. The fibril was sampled for TEM analysis and SDS-PAGE, and then concentrated to 2% of the original volume by centrifugation and removal of supernatant. The concentrated solution was loaded between two siliconized glass capillaries with their heads facing each other. The solution was then dried out and the fibril remained on one of the capillary heads in solid form. The capillary with fibril was mounted on an in-house X-ray machine and the fibril was shot by X-ray for 3 mins. The diffraction pattern was detected and recorded by a CCD detector.

The crystal structures of zipper forming segments were used for generation of fibril diffraction simulation. To simulate the fibril diffraction patterns, the space group of each crystal structure was expanded into P1, and structure factors were calculated using the CCP4 program sfall 69 . The diffraction patterns were cylindrically averaged 180 degrees around the fibril axis using custom written software.

Samples for TEM were prepared by applying 5 µL of sample on hydrophilic 400 mesh carbon-coated formvar support films mounted on copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.). The fibrils were allowed to adhere for 4 min and washed twice with water. The samples were then stained for 2 min with 2% uranyl acetate, leaving a few nanoliters of stain on the grid. Grids were allowed to dry for 1 minute before storage. Each grid was inspected on a T12 (FEI) microscope.

SUMO-TDP-CTF wild type and its mutants were diluted into 0.2 mg/ml with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT and filtered by 0.1 µm Ultrafree-MC-VV centrifugal filters (Millipore). The filtered solution was mixed with 100:1 (weight basis) homemade ULP1 protease and incubated on ice to remove the SUMO-tag from TDP-CTF. The samples were taken before and 30 mins after adding the protease, and the 30-minute-samples were divided into supernatant and pellet fraction by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 3 mins at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was re-suspended with the same buffer used in dilution and with the same volume of the original samples. The samples were mixed with 3:1 (v/v) of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heated to 100 °C for 10 mins. After the 30-minute-samples were taken, the cleavage solutions were moved to refrigerator (4 °C) and incubated overnight. The overnight samples were then taken and prepared same as 30-minute-samples. All samples were loaded to and separated by NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and stained by coomassie blue. To make better comparisons, the samples of wild type TDP-CTF were loaded to both gels when the samples taken from the same time point were split into two gels because of loading well limitation.

SDS-PBS stocks with varies SDS content were mixed with 20 mM peptide-PBS solution in 1:1 volume ratio to get final peptide solutions with 2%, 1.5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0% (m/v) SDS. All solutions were divided into 3 PCR tubes (5 µl per tube), and the solutions contain 2%, 1.5%, 1% and 0.5% (m/v) SDS were heated to 70 °C for 15 mins by a thermocycler. The OD340 of solutions in each tube were measured by P330 NanoPhotometer (Implen), and the readings from same peptide were normalized to the mean values of the solutions contain no SDS and without heating.

Aβ purification and preparation please see our previous study 70 . Aβ1–42 was diluted into 50 µM with PBS buffer, and incubated at 37 °C overnight to form Aβ fibrils. The fibril solution was mixed with 10% (v/v) of 20% (m/v) SDS stock to make 2% (m/v) final SDS concentration, and heated to 70 °C for 15 mins. The samples were taken before and after adding SDS and heating, and analyzed by TEM.

These R-factors are higher than expected for a data set of this quality. We think the discrepancy is due to a disorder in the crystal. The P1 unit cell dimensions of SWGMMGLASQ allow pseudo-merohedral twinning (pseudo space group C2). Also, the native Patterson map suggests that the crystal contains a translocation disorder (peak at 0.379, −0.264, −0.471 with height of 36% of the origin peak). Attempts to correct for these disorders did not improve the R-factors significantly.
