# Title
Progranulin, lysosomal regulation and neurodegenerative disease

# Abstract
The discovery that heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the gene encoding progranulin are causally linked to frontotemporal dementia and lysosomal storage disease, respectively, reveals previously unrecognized roles of the progranulin protein in regulating lysosome biogenesis and function. Given the importance of lysosomes in cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that progranulin deficiency has pleiotropic effects on neural circuit development and maintenance, stress response, innate immunity and ageing. This Progress article reviews recent advances in progranulin biology emphasizing its roles in lysosomal function and brain innate immunity, and outlines future avenues of investigation that may lead to new therapeutic approaches for neurodegeneration.

## Evolution of progranulin
Progranulin is a phylogenetically ancient, cysteine-rich, secreted protein with several interesting features. First, progranulin serves as a precursor protein (or holoprotein) that can be cleaved into granulin. Granulins seem to oppose the activity of the holoprotein, at least in wound healing, inflammation and neuroprotection 12 – 14 . Each granulin consists of an approximately 60 amino-acid motif repeated in a tandem manner throughout the protein. Most commonly, a granulin domain consists of 12 cysteines (two individual cysteines at the amino and carboxyl ends bookending four sets of vicinal pairs) that form six disulfide bonds. The disulfide bonds formed by cysteines confer granulins with a stable, structurally compact, stacked β-sheet configuration that is potentially protease resistant 15 . However, granulin variants are found with fewer cysteines. For example, the human petite granulin has 6 cysteines, and granulin G has 10 cysteines. The structural and functional differences conferred by differential cysteine number are currently not known.

The number of granulin repeats are highly variable through phylogeny: whereas Dictyostelium discoideum and flowering plants have a single granulin, Caenorhabditis elegans has 3 granulin repeats, humans have 7 granulin repeats (apart from petite granulin), and exon duplications in zebrafish have expanded the number of granulin repeats to at least 11, possibly 12 (REF. 16 ) ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 1 ). This diversity in granulin repeats suggests that they have an active biological role, with different granulins taking on distinct specificities. Structurally, granulins belong to a larger family of cysteine-rich mini-proteins, which includes oxytocin, epidermal growth factor and defensins 17 . These small cysteine-rich proteins function as hormones, growth factors, ion channel modulators and enzyme inhibitors. Exploring potential analogies to other cysteine-rich mini-proteins could shed light on the function of both the progranulin holoprotein and the cleaved granulins.

Progranulins are evolutionary ancient proteins that emerged about 1.5 billion years ago 1 . Granulin-domain-containing proteins are found in unicellular eukaryotes, plants, metazoan animals and vertebrates, and they are among the first extracellular regulatory proteins still used by multicellular animals 16 . Across species, the granulin domains share conserved cysteine residues. However, the number of granulin domains per progranulin is highly variable from species to species. A single granulin domain is found in basal eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium discoideum , whereas Caenorhabditis elegans has 3 granulin repeats, Xenopus tropicalis has 14 and the purple sea urchin has 27 granulin domains 90 . This domain diversity is achieved by the duplication and/or loss of the combination of exons encoding granulin peptides 16 . In some lineages, granulins are also associated with other domains, such as a cysteine protease domain in many plants including Arabidopsis thaliana . No progranulin gene has been identified in Drosophila species.

In addition to duplication of its granulin domains, the progranulin gene family has expanded in many vertebrate lineages, and this evolutionary history may provide hints about progranulin functions. Whereas most vertebrates have a single copy of GRN (which encodes progranulin), fish genomes contain multiple grn paralogues, often comprising long-form paralogues with multiple granulin domains and short-form paralogues with only one or two granulin domains 91 . For example, killifish and zebrafish have two long-form grn and one or two short-form grn , respectively. These two sets of paralogues have distinct origins. Short-form progranulins originated in vertebrates, were lost in tetrapods but were preserved in some teleost for more than 500 million years 16 . Fish long-form progranulins were created by whole-genome duplication about 300 million years ago, and the duplicated paralogues were preserved, a pattern consistent with vertebrate genes that show greater association with disease 92 . The evolutionary dynamics of GRN reflect its crucial regulatory function and may be instrumental to understanding how a primitive regulatory protein is employed in complex tissue functions during metazoan evolution.

Although progranulin can be cleaved into individual granulin domains, one must be mindful not to conflate progranulin levels with that of its cleavage products. In other words, levels of progranulin and granulin may be independently regulated, tethered in the same direction (progranulin↑, granulin ↑) or in opposite directions (progranulin ↓, granulin ↑). Progranulin also undergoes regulated glycosylation 18 , 19 , protecting it from lysosomal enzyme-mediated degradation and adding a layer of complexity to its localization and half-life.

Progranulin is broadly expressed by many cell types, although the expression is low in muscles or resting endothelium 20 , 21 . Within the CNS, GRN mRNA is produced by a wide range of cell types including neurons, microglia, endothelial cells and astrocytes 22 . Although its putative role is in the lysosome, an amino-terminal secretion signal directs progranulin to secretory vesicles in which it undergoes regulated exocytosis 23 . This confers both potential autocrine and endocrine roles to progranulin. A case in point is progranulin in microglia, in which basal progranulin levels and secretion are low; upon activation, microglial progranulin expression increases significantly and is likely to have an impact on neuronal function and synaptic density 24 . Thus, when examining progranulin levels, it is important to consider the source of progranulin and whether it is derived from an intracellular or an extracellular source, or some combination of both. Indeed, results from a large-scale study show poor correlations of progranulin levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 25 .

In addition to its potential roles as a growth factor, structural similarities between progranulin and other secreted proteins have led to the hypothesis that progranulin, and perhaps the cleaved granulins, may function as neurotrophic factors to promote neuronal survival and differentiation. In support of this idea, progranulin levels are reduced in the CSF of patients with FTD with GRN mutations 25 . Further, some reports found that human recombinant full-length progranulin and granulin E peptide (amino acids 494–594) can seemingly promote survival and neurite outgrowth in rat spinal motor neurons, cortical neurons and hippocampal neurons in vitro 26 – 29 , whereas exogenous progranulin rescues the neurite outgrowth phenotypes in G rn −/− neurons. By contrast, FTD-associated pathogenic mutations in progranulin interfere with the neurite outgrowth promoting activity 27 – 29 . Although these results suggest that progranulin functions as an exogenous trophic factor to promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival, it is interesting to note that knocking down progranulin in hippocampal neurons and SH-SY5Y cells also compromises their survival, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation 28 , 30 , further suggesting that progranulin functions via autocrine mechanisms. Indeed, progranulin has been shown to be co-transported with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dendrites and axons of cultured hippocampal neurons in both anterograde and retrograde manners, and the secretion of progranulin seems to be modulated by neuronal activity 23 .

Despite these observations, one major challenge in validating the neurotrophic property of progranulin is the lack of evidence for a definitive receptor that interacts with progranulin and initiates signal transduction pathways to promote survival and neurite outgrowth in neurons. Although tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and sortilin have been implicated as progranulin receptors 31 , 32 , evidence supporting these proteins as the bona fide receptors that transduce progranulin signals is still elusive. Sortilin traffics extracellular progranulin to the lysosome rather than serving as a signalling hub. Further, the reported interactions between progranulin and TNF receptor were not reproduced by co-immunoprecipitation or surface plasmon resonance 33 . Thus, it is unclear how progranulin could regulate neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth via the TNF-mediated mechanism. Curiously, recombinant progranulin continues to promote neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons lacking sortilin in vitro 29 , and inhibition of the granulin E–sortilin interaction does not diminish the ability of granulin E to promote neurite outgrowth 34 . Interestingly, a recent study showed that progranulin binds to ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2) on the cell surface and that such interaction activates the tyrosine kinase activity of EPHA2 and the downstream kinase AKT 35 . The interaction between progranulin and EPHA2 promotes capillary morphogenesis and the autoregulation of GRN mRNA, which does not require sortilin. Although these new results provide novel insights into the role of progranulin as a growth factor that promotes angiogenesis, the role of EPHA2 in neurite outgrowth and in neurodegeneration remains to be determined.

## Progranulin dosage and disease
Several lines of evidence indicate that progranulin has gene-dosage-dependent effects on neurodegeneration. As previously indicated, GRN haploinsufficiency causes familial forms of FTD 2 , 3 . GRN mutations that are associated with neurodegenerative disease (for a list of mutations, see http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/FTDmutations/ ) largely result in premature stop codons and nonsense mediated decay, although a few familial mutations impair secretion or produce full-length protein with loss of a key cysteine residue 27 , 36 , 37 . GRN -mutation carriers have serum levels of progranulin that are more than 50% lower than the levels in non-carriers 38 , and pathologically these patients develop FTLD with neuronal cytoplasmic protein aggregates enriched in hyperphosphorylated, cleaved TDP43 (REF. 39 ) ( BOX 2 ).

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) describes a clinical condition of progressive neurodegenerative syndrome causing cognitive changes in the frontal executive, language and/or behavioural domains 93 . The neuropathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) ranges from diffuse symmetric atrophy in bilateral frontal and temporal lobes to lobar atrophy that asymmetrically affects one cerebral hemisphere and to focal lesions that selectively affect the language areas. Microscopically, FTLD can be further classified based on the accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons or glia, including tau (FTLD-tau), TAR DNA-binding protein 43(TDP43; which is encoded by TARDBP ) (FTLD-TDP) and FUS (FTLD-FUS) 94 , 95 . A small number of patients with FTLD show no definitive proteinopathy but have clear evidence of abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (FTLD-UPS).

Following the discovery of mutations in GRN (which encodes progranulin), it was reported that TDP43 is an abundant polyubiquitylated protein in the brain tissues of patients with FTLD-UPS 4 , 5 . Depending on the distribution and subcellular localization of TDP43 aggregates, FTLD-TDP can be further divided into four subtypes: type A (mutations in GRN and C9ORF72 ), type B (mutations in C9ORF72 and TARDBP ), type C, and type D (mutation in valosin-containing protein ( VCP )).

Individuals with GRN mutations typically present with behavioural variant FTD (characterized by apathy, irritability, social withdrawal, loss of empathy and compulsive, impulsive or inappropriate behaviour) or primary progressive aphasia (decreased fluency and word-finding difficulty) subtypes, although symptoms can be accompanied by parkinsonism and/or aspects of corticobasal degeneration 96 . The propensity for FTD associated with GRN mutations to cause clinically heterogeneous disease within families suggests additional genetic, epigenetic or environmental contributions to phenotype.



Individuals who carry two mutant GRN alleles, and thus completely lack progranulin and its cleavage products (functional null), develop a lysosomal storage disease that is now known as NCL (or ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis-11 (CLN11)) 10 , 11 , 40 . These patients have undetectable levels of progranulin in the plasma and develop neurological deficits, such as vision loss, myoclonic seizures and cerebellar ataxia between 20 and 30 years of age. Skin biopsy reveals lipofuscin accumulation in a vacuole-like organelle, confirming the NCL diagnosis. Interestingly, several studies show that cortical neurons and lymphoblasts from patients with FTLD with GRN mutations also contain a marked increase in lysosomal storage materials 41 , 42 . Together, these results further support the gene-dosage effects of progranulin deficiency in neurodegeneration.

The dosage-dependent effects of progranulin deficiency can also be detected in mouse models. For instance, heterozygous Grn +/− mice develop age-dependent social and behavioural deficits but show no evidence of gliosis or neurodegeneration 43 . By contrast, homozygous Grn −/− mice display premature death and age-dependent gliosis and lipofuscin deposits, recapitulating aspects of lysosomal storage disease 24 , 44 – 47 . Although the function of progranulin in the lysosomes is still unclear, these results have pivoted the field towards this organelle to understand how progranulin exerts its pleiotropic activities.

## Trafficking of progranulin
How might progranulin deficiency cause lysosomal defects? During synthesis, progranulin is translated directly into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen where it associates with protein disulfide isomerases 48 , presumably for co-translational folding and, in humans, formation of its up to 44 disulfide bonds. From there, it is likely to be trafficked through the Golgi via transport vesicles, although the characteristics of these vesicles and the circumstances surrounding their secretion are incompletely understood. Once in the extracellular space, potential fates for progranulin include cleavage into granulins by an extracellular proteases 12 , 14 , 49 – 51 or uptake into target cells via binding of its C terminus to sortilin 31 . Sortilin ultimately delivers progranulin via trafficking from endosomes to the lysosome, where it may be cleaved and/or degraded in a manner that regulates intracellular levels 31 , 52 ( FIG. 2 ).

Recently, an alternative route to the lysosome involving another potentially secreted glycoprotein, prosaposin, has been described. Prosaposin and progranulin exhibit striking parallels. Like progranulin, prosaposin cleavage results in a set of cysteine-rich peptides, saposins 53 , which function in the lysosome to promote sphingolipid hydrolysis 54 and utilize sortilin as a trafficking receptor 55 – 57 . A homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding prosaposin leads to a lysosomal storage disease known as sphingolipidoses, which is similar to NCL in that it results from failed lysosomal macromolecular degradation 54 , 58 . Thus, in some ways, it is not surprising that progranulin and prosaposin form heterodimers 59 , 60 and that prosaposin can regulate both intracellular and secreted progranulin levels 61 ( FIG. 2 ). In addition, prosaposin provides a direct route for progranulin to reach the lysosome, serving as a molecular bridge between progranulin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) 59 . Although much remains to be learned about the relationship between progranulin and prosaposin, their similarities and intertwined fates suggest a cellular coordination that is important in lysosome function and regulation 9 .

## Lysosome and neurodegeneration
Despite the subcellular localization of progranulin, the exact functions of intracellular progranulin remain obscure. Evidence supporting a role for progranulin in the lysosome includes its delivery to the endolysosomal system by sortilin, its colocalization with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), as well as the finding that Grn −/− mice demonstrate increased reactivity for LAMP1 in certain brain regions 31 , 62 , 63 . These results support a role for progranulin in regulating the formation and function of lysosomes.

As a major site of macromolecular breakdown and recycling, lysosomes occupy an integral role in cellular proteostasis. Lysosome and autophagy dysfunction have been key players in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis 64 . For example, mutations in the gene GBA (which encodes β-glucocerebrosidase) increase the risk of Parkinson disease and Lewy body disease 65 . Homozygous loss of GBA has been associated with a form of Gaucher disease, a juvenile onset lysosomal storage disease. Other variants of NCL-associated genes, including cathepsin D ( CTSD ) and probable cation-transporting ATPase 13A2 ( ATP13A2 ; also known as PARK9 ) are also linked to AD and Parkinson disease, respectively 66 , 67 . Recently, attention has focused on the lysosome as a nutrient sensor and signal integration centre through the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) 68 . Progranulin also has links to the master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, the transcription factor TFEB 69 , 70 . Upon translocation into the nucleus, TFEB activates its target genes to induce lysosomal biogenesis, which increases the degradative capacity of the cell ( FIG. 2 ). Both progranulin and prosaposin are targets of TFEB 69 , 71 . In fact, the promoter of GRN contains TFEB binding sites, and progranulin expression is upregulated by TFEB overexpression 69 , 72 . As such, progranulin is highly co-regulated with other lysosomal genes 72 .

A recent study provided evidence that the cleaved granulins may play a part in lysosome function by impairing degradation of TDP43. In C. elegans , when granulins are expressed in the absence of the full-length protein, they increase levels of neuronal TDP43 and exacerbate its toxicity 13 . This first demonstration of a neurotoxic role for granulins supports a role for full-length progranulin and processed granulins converging in the lysosome. Based on these results, it is tempting to propose that a delicate balance of progranulin and granulins in the lysosome is crucial to regulate the biogenesis and function of this important intracellular organelle. Thus, both a complete absence of progranulin and excessive levels of granulins seem to negatively modulate lysosome function. Regardless, further studies exploring in more detail the relationship, regulation and potential biological interactions between the holoprotein and the granulins are warranted.

## Progranulin and brain innate immunity
Given the prominent functions of lysosomes in phagocytic cells, including macrophages and microglia, it is not surprising that progranulin has been implicated in the function of the innate immune system. Progranulin has been shown to be a microglial chemoattractant 73 , whereas lower-molecular-mass granulins bind to, and potentiate signalling from, macrophage toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which is involved in innate immunity 74 . Several studies indicate that complete loss of progranulin causes an aberrant increase in phagocytosis and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia and macrophages 45 , 46 , 75 . For instance, acute exposure to the neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induces more robust microglial activation and neurodegeneration in Grn −/− mice and microglia-specific conditional Grn -knockout ( CD11b– Cre ;Grn fl/fl ) mice 45 . In this model, many Grn −/− and CD11b– Cre ;Grn fl/fl microglial cells exhibit prominent reactive features, as if they are actively engulfing injured neurons. These results support the idea that progranulin is normally required to suppress excessive microglial activation in an acute neural injury paradigm. Interestingly, progranulin seems to have similar roles in suppressing microglial activation during ageing. Transcriptomic profiling of several brain regions from a large cohort of ageing Grn +/+ , Grn +/− and Grn −/− mice shows a prominent age-dependent upregulation of genes that are related to lysosomal functions and innate immunity in Grn −/− mouse brain 24 . Most genes that are dysregulated in the absence of progranulin belong to microglia, suggesting an essential role of progranulin in suppressing microglial activation in the ageing brain. Interestingly, in wild-type microglia, progranulin is localized to late endosomes, recycling endosomes and early lysosomes 24 , suggesting that progranulin regulates the formation and/or trafficking of these compartments ( FIG. 2 ). By contrast, Grn −/− microglia show a marked increase in the size and number of lysosomes 24 . Consistent with a role for progranulin in regulating intracellular trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes, Grn −/− microglia exhibit increased synaptic pruning activity and preferentially remove inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus 24 .

How might progranulin deficiency promote microglial activation in Grn −/− mice during ageing? Previous studies showed that loss of progranulin leads to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-6, in microglia 45 , 46 . In addition, some complement genes, including C1qa , C1qb , C1qc and C3 , were upregulated in Grn −/− mice before the onset of neurodegenerative features. System-level analysis of these dysregulated genes shows extensive functional interactions between the innate immunity genes and lysosomal genes. As the classical complement pathway is a well-recognized arm of the innate immunity surveillance system 76 , these results suggest that aberrant activation of the complement pathway has key mechanistic contributions to the excessive synaptic pruning observed in Grn −/− mice ( FIG. 3 ). Indeed, genetic deletion of C1qa reduces synaptic pruning activity in Grn −/− microglia and protects against the excessive synaptic loss that disrupts sensorimotor integration in the thalamocortical neural circuit. Taken together, these results suggest that neurodegeneration due to progranulin deficiency may be partially caused by altered lysosome function and subsequent aberrant microglial activation. This increased activity then results in overly aggressive synapse removal, thus suggesting a crucial role for microglia as potential drivers of neurodegeneration ( FIG. 3 ).

One prominent and unexpected neurodegenerative feature in Grn −/− mice is the preferential loss of inhibitory synapses in the thalamocortical circuit. Although both excitatory and inhibitory synapses are tagged with complements, only inhibitory synapses show an age-dependent loss 24 . As a consequence, the thalamocortical circuit in Grn −/− mice exhibits hyperexcitability that contributes to the excessive grooming behaviour in these mice. Consistent with the prerequisite role of complement activation in synaptic pruning, removal of C1qa protects the loss of inhibitory synapses, mitigates the hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuit, reduces excessive grooming and prolongs the survival of Grn −/− C1qa −/− mice. The microglial dysfunction and hyper-excitability in the thalamocortical circuit seen in Grn −/− mice during ageing bring important insights into the pathogenesis of human disease. Indeed, patients with FTLD with GRN mutations show a progressive increase in levels of complements C1qa and C3 in the CSF, as well as intense microglial infiltration in the frontal cortex. Future studies should determine whether GRN carriers also exhibit evidence of hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuit.

## Therapeutics discovery
In humans and model organisms, age has been observed to increase progranulin levels 25 , 75 . In addition, stressful stimuli, such as hypoxia, acidosis, hyperosmolarity and inhibition of lysosomal function by artificial alkalinization 52 , seem to increase progranulin production and secretion 72 , 77 , 78 , alter its glycosylation 18 and possibly promote its cleavage 12 , 14 , 50 , 51 . Low circulating levels of progranulin in GRN carriers 38 suggest that progranulin expression from the wild-type allele might be a potential therapeutic target. Consistent with this, Cenik and colleagues 79 designed a luciferase-based screen and identified the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) as an enhancer of progranulin expression. However, dose–response relationship suggests that SAHA reaches a ‘ceiling’ effect in upregulating progranulin mRNA and protein levels. These results imply that progranulin expression is tightly regulated by epigenetic modifications of the GRN locus and by additional post-translational mechanisms.

Indeed, it has been suggested that prosaposin forms heterodimers with progranulin and regulates the intracellular and secreted levels of progranulin 59 – 61 ( FIG. 2 ). In addition, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) seems to directly bind to progranulin to prevent its cleavage 14 . Similarly, lysosome alkalinization increases expression of progranulin, presumably by altering its transport, degradation or cleavage into granulins 52 . Finally, several microRNAs, including miR-659, miR-29b and miR-107 (REFS 80 – 83 ), have been shown to regulate progranulin protein level by altering translation and/or mRNA stability. Individuals who are TT homozygotes at the rs5848 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locus show tighter miR-659 binding, which leads to a decrease in progranulin levels and to a 3.2-fold increase in risk of FTLD with TDP43 accumulation 80 . Additional understanding of how progranulin expression and cleavage are regulated may aid in future development of therapeutic strategies.

## Future perspectives
The discovery that progranulin may affect formation and function of intracellular organelles and activate microglial innate immunity in the CNS provides new and exciting insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for FTLD. First, the profound microglial activation phenotype in the brains of Grn −/− mice and patients with FTLD with GRN mutations raises the intriguing possibility that progranulin-deficient microglia may disrupt the homeostatic balance of glia–neuron interactions and promote neurodegeneration in the ageing brain ( FIG. 3 ). Although this can be achieved by activating innate immunity pathways, including pathways related to the complement system and pro-inflammatory cytokines in progranulin-deficient microglia, it is possible that progranulin-deficient microglia could recruit and activate astrocytes that may have additional cytotoxic effects on neurons. In support of this idea, a recent study shows that in a lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation model, microglia can release IL-1α, TNF and C1qa to activate astrocytes 84 . In future studies, it will be important to determine whether Grn −/− microglia use similar or entirely different mechanism to activate Grn −/− astrocytes. Alternatively, loss of progranulin may convert astrocytes into a more aggressive phenotype such that Grn −/− microglia and Grn −/− astrocytes cooperatively promote neurodegeneration ( FIG. 3 ).

Second, another important question regarding the fundamental role of progranulin in lysosomes is how this function affects cells beyond microglia and macrophages. Given the presence of progranulin in many cell types, it is likely that progranulin may have broader roles in regulating lysosomes in other cell types, including neurons, with consequences on proteostasis and stress response. In support of this idea, neurons in G rn −/− mice show pathological features similar to those seen in NCL 44 – 47 . Similar lysosomal phenotypes have also been detected in patients with FTLD with GRN mutations 41 , 42 . Future studies are required to determine whether simultaneous losses of progranulin in microglia, astrocytes and neurons have synergistic effects to promote neurodegeneration ( FIG. 3 ).

Third, the highly evolutionarily conserved granulin repeat motif and the diverse downstream effects of progranulin loss, deficiency and excess suggest that progranulin and granulin have broader roles in ageing and proteostasis outside of the CNS. Indeed, a recent study in African turquoise killifish shows that a variant in the killifish grn gene is in a region that is genetically linked to lifespan regulation 85 . Although multiple other potential lifespan genes are also present in that region, the grn gene is a strong candidate to underlie lifespan differences not only because it is in the region that is the most clearly associated with differences in lifespan but also because it harbours coding variants in the granulin repeat domain analogous to FTD variants. Clearly, precise maintenance of progranulin levels is important, as demonstrated by both its disease associations and the multiple layers of regulation around gene expression (promoter and microRNAs), modification (disulfide bonding and glycosylation), trafficking (sortilin, prosaposin and M6PR), processing (into granulins) and degradation. Evidence even exists supporting a role for progranulin in phagocytosis and removal of amyloid plaques 86 .

Last, progranulin is certainly not alone as a neurodegenerative disease gene implicated in microglial functions. In fact, abnormal activation of innate immunity is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. Although several clinical studies have identified rare GRN -mutation carriers with clinical, imaging and neuropathological evidence of AD 87 – 89 , it remains unclear how patients with those mutations or other GRN variants have a higher propensity to develop AD pathology. Given the complex neurodegenerative features in patients with AD, future studies using a larger series of GRN -mutation carriers and quantitative measurements will be required to provide more mechanistic insights into how reduced progranulin levels may affect the development of amyloid and tau pathology. In addition to the potential role of progranulin in AD pathology, it is possible that reduced progranulin level may promote proteostasis defects via related processes such as stress response and protein clearance.

## Conclusion
Although regulation of progranulin and its cleavage products affords great therapeutic potential in multiple disease modalities, clarity regarding how they modulate growth, innate immunity and proteostasis is needed. New model systems to explore these questions, as well as the role of progranulin and granulin in ageing and potentially other yet-to-be identified disorders, would also benefit the field. Efforts to boost progranulin levels have somewhat outpaced our knowledge as to its precise responsibilities in the lysosome in phagocytic and other cell types. Further, little is known regarding how cleaved granulins are produced and regulated, and about their function. Such knowledge could shift efforts, for example, away from enhancing progranulin levels in microglia towards increasing neuronal progranulin. Alternatively, an approach such as inhibiting progranulin cleavage into granulins could be explored. Until a more cogent understanding of progranulin and granulin function is gained, efforts to manipulate their levels for clinical application should proceed cautiously. Nonetheless, progranulin and granulin remain complex yet integral factors in human health with pleiotropic downstream effects that aptly illustrate how the precise regulation of a protein and its cleavage products can contribute to cellular homeostasis and prevention of disease.
