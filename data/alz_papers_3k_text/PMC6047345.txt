A somatic mutation in erythro-myeloid progenitors causes neurodegenerative disease

# Abstract
The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood, and therapeutic options are few. Neurodegenerative diseases are hallmarked by progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss, associated with chronic glial activation 1 . Whether microglial activation, which is viewed in general as a secondary process, is detrimental or protective in neurodegeneration remains unclear 1 – 8 . Late-onset neurodegenerative disease observed in patients with histiocytoses 9 – 12 , which are clonal myeloid diseases associated with somatic mutations in the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway such as BRAF V600E 13 – 17 , suggests a possible role of somatic mutations in myeloid cells in neurodegeneration. Yet expression of BRAF V600E in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lineage causes leukemic and tumoral diseases but not neurodegenerative disease 18 , 19 . Microglia belong to a lineage of adult tissue-resident myeloid cells that develop during organogenesis from yolk sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) distinct from HSC 20 – 23 . We thus hypothesized that a somatic BRAF V600E mutation in the EMP lineage may cause neurodegeneration. Here we show that mosaic expression of BRAF V600E in EMP results in clonal expansion of tissue-resident macrophages and a severe late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, associated with accumulation of ERK-activated amoeboid microglia in mice, also observed in human histiocytoses patients. In the murine model, neurobehavioral signs, astrogliosis, amyloid precursor protein deposition, synaptic loss and neuronal death were driven by ERK-activated microglia and were preventable by BRAF inhibition. These results identify the fetal precursors of tissue-resident macrophages as a potential cell-of-origin for histiocytoses, and demonstrate in mice that a somatic mutation in the EMP lineage can drive late-onset neurodegeneration. Moreover, these data identify activation of the MAP kinase pathway in microglia as a cause of neurodegeneration, and provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Methods
EMPs appear in the yolk sac at embryonic day (E) 8.5 and express the Csf1 receptor ( Csf1r ) 20 , 22 , 23 . They colonize the fetal liver from E9.5 and give rise to macrophage precursors (pMacs) that distribute in embryonic tissues and differentiate into tissue-specific macrophage subsets such as microglia in the central nervous system 23 . Therefore, to investigate the consequences of BRAF V600E expression in the EMP lineage, we genetically targeted EMPs by pulse labeling Csf1r MeriCreMer ; BRAF LSL-V600E ; Rosa26 LSL-YFP E8.5 embryos with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma) 20 . Embryonic development was estimated considering the day of vaginal plug formation as 0.5 days post-coitum (dpc). Cre recombination in Csf1r MeriCreMer ; Rosa26 LSL-YFP ; BRAF LSL-V600E embryos was induced by single injection of 37.5 mg per kg (body weight) of OH-TAM into pregnant females. Short-lived 4-OHT leads to transient nuclear translocation of the estrogen receptor-Cre recombinase fusion protein (MeriCreMer) in cells expressing the Csfr1 MeriCreMer transgene and deletion of a floxed stop cassette (LSL) in the BRAF LSL-V600E and Rosa26 LSL-YFP alleles. OH-TAM was supplemented with 18.75 mg per kg (body weight) progesterone (Sigma) to counteract the mixed oestrogen agonist effects of tamoxifen, which can result in fetal abortions.

Csf1r MeriCreMer , Csf1r iCre , CD11 Cre , Rosa26 YFP-LSL mice 20 , 22 , 27 , 31 and BRAF LSL-V600E 26 mice -kindly provided by C. Pritchard (Leicester, UK)- were maintained under SPF conditions. Animal procedures were performed in adherence to our project licenses issued by the Institutional Review Board (IACUC 15-04-006 and 13-04-003) from MSKCC. Genotyping was performed according to protocols described previously for Csf1r iCre 32 Csf1r MeriCreMer 20 , CD11 Cre 31 and BRAF LSL-V600E 26 mice. BRAF WT Cre − , BRAF V600E Cre − , BRAF WT Cre + animals were considered as BRAF WT for representation of data. For BRAF inhibition, animals were placed on ad libitum PLX4720 diet at 1 or 3 months of age (PLX4720-containing chow 417ppm, provided by Plexxikon Inc. 33 ). BRAF WT and BRAF VE male and female littermates were assigned randomly into the control or treated group. Scoring of mice was performed blinded and at least weekly by assessing hindlimb reflexes and other behavioral phenotypes such as axial rolling 34 , 35 . The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Mice were given two trials to run down a runway before the experiment. Mouse forepaws and hindpaws were painted with red and blue ink, respectively. Mice were then allowed to run down a runway lined with white paper. At least four steps from the middle portion of each run were measured for (1) overlap between forepaw and hindpaw placement, (2) stride length, (3) front-base width (the distance between the right and left forelimb strides) and (4) hind-base width (the distance between the right and left hindlimb strides) 36 . Mean values were used for graphs and statistical analyses.

The assay was conducted using a ROTO-ROD series 8 (IITC life sciences) with accelerating speed (accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over 120 s). The mice were trained on the accelerating rotarod with 3 training session per day for 3 days. On the day of the experiment, the mean latency to fall off the rotarod recorded in the 3 trials was used in the analysis.

Pregnant females were killed by exposure to CO 2 . Embryos were removed from the uterus, washed in 4°C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) and dissected under a Leica M80 microscope. For blood phenotyping of adult mice, mice were anaesthetized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Bone marrow was collected by flushing one leg with 5 ml RPMI (Invitrogen). For flow cytometry experiments, organs were incubated in PBS containing 1mg/ml collagenase D (Roche), 100U/ml DNase I (Sigma), 2.4mg/ml of dispase (Invitrogen) and 3% FCS (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min prior to mechanical disruption. For embryonic tissue incubation time at 37°C was reduced to 20 min. For cell sorting, tissues were digested for 30min at RT in PBS containing 2 mg/ml of collagenase D (Roche), 200U/ml DNase I (Sigma), 4.8 mg/ml of dispase (Invitrogen), 3% FCS (Invitrogen) and 1uM of flavopiridol (Sigma) followed by mechanical disruption under a 100um filter. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 320g for 7 min, resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA and 2 mm EDTA) containing purified anti-CD16/32 (1:100 dilution) and 5 % normal mouse, 5 % normal rat and 5 % normal rabbit serum and incubated for 15min at 4°C. Samples were immunostained with antibodies mixes for 30 min at 4°C. For FMO (fluorescence minus one), brain cell suspensions from BRAF WT and BRAF VE mice were mixed prior to staining. The full list of antibodies used can be found in Supplementary Table 5 . Cell sorting was performed using an Aria III BD cell sorter. Single live cells were gated on the basis of dead cell exclusion (DAPI), side (SSC-A) and forward scatter (FSC-A) gating, and doublet exclusion using forward scatter width (FSC-W) against FSC-A. Macrophage populations were identified after gating on CD45 based on expression of F4/80, CD11b and YFP. 200 cells for each sample were directly sorted into a 96 well plate (Biorad) in 4ul of H 2 O containing 0.2% of triton-X (Sigma) and 0.8U/ul of RNAse inhibitor (Clontech), and processed as indicated below.

For intracellular stainings, cell suspensions were purified by a Percoll (Sigma) gradient (70/37/30%), and cells were collected from the 70/37 interface. After washing twice with PBS, cells were stained with a viability dye (Ghost Dye Red 780, Tonbo Biosciences) according to manufacturers protocol. Cells were first stained with antibodies for surface markers (see Supplementary Table 5 ), then processed for intracellular stainings using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Affymetrix eBioscience) according to manufacturers protocol. Cell numbers per organ or per gram of tissue were calculated as follows. For embryonic tissues, cell suspensions were prepared, stained, and acquired from whole organs, and the number of live cells per tissue was directly obtained from FCS files. In adult mice, organs were weighted, cell suspensions were prepared from 20 to 500 mg of tissue, and the number of cells per gram of tissue was determined using a cell counter (GUAVA easyCyte HT). For gating strategies used for different tissues, see Supplementary Figure 2 . Proportion of YFP + F4/80 + cells in tissues from BRAF VE and BRAF WT littermates were analyzed by calculating the proportion of YFP + among F4/80 + cells. Values from BRAF WT littermates were then normalized and set to 1.

Sorted cells underwent amplification (14 cycles) using the SMART-seq V4 (Clonetech) ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing. 10 ng of amplified cDNA was used to prepare Illumina hiseq libraries with the Kapa DNA library preparation chemistry (Kapa Biosystems) using 8 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2500 1T in a 50bp/50bp Paired end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An average of 54 million paired reads were generated per sample and the percent of mRNA bases was closed to 77% on average. FASTQ files were mapped to the Mouse genome mm10 using the Star aligner 37 that maps reads gnomically and resolves reads across splice junctions. We used several QC metrics for the RNA-seq library, including intron–exon ratio, intragenic reads fraction, and GC bias. We quantified exon and gene expression using Sailfish against the Mus musculus transcriptome GRCh38 38 . After merging technical replicates differential expression tests were performed using the DESEQ2 algorithm 39 . We considered genes that had a FDR<0.01 to be significantly different between genotypes and ranked significant genes by fold-change with a cutoff of 1. Gene set enrichment analysis on KEGG pathway, GO term, Reactome, and MSigDB gene set collection was done using the over-representation test with hypergeometric model to assess whether the number of selected genes associated with disease is larger than expected 40 .

Snap frozen normal brain tissues were obtained from the MSKCC Medical Donation Program. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen all prep DNA/RNA mini kit (Cat#80204) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAs were submitted to ribogreen quantification and quality control on Agilent BioAnalyzer. Average amount was 5.3ug, Average RIN was 8.9. 500ng of total RNA underwent polyA selection and Truseq library preparation according to instruction provided by Illumina (TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2), with 8 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 4000 in a 125bp/125bp Paired end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An average of 75 million paired reads was generated per sample. At the most the ribosomal reads represented 7% and the percent of mRNA bases was closed to 45% on average. FASTQ files from control brains and previously sequenced JXG and LCH brain samples (SJLCH13 and SJLCH14) 17 were mapped to Human genome GRCh37 using Star aligner. We used several QC metrics for the RNA-seq library, including intron–exon ratio, intragenic reads fraction, and GC bias. We quantified exon and gene expression using Salmon against Homo sapiens transcriptome GRCh37 38 . Differential expression tests, statistical tests and pathway analysis was performed as described above for murine RNA-seq.

Embryos were imaged using a Leica M80 or Zeiss Axio Zoom.V16. Tissues were fixed for 1–3 days in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma). After fixation, tissues for cryosections were incubated overnight in 30% sucrose and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek). Cryoblocks were cut at a thickness of 16 µm for liver and 50 µm for spinal cord and brain and then blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Invitrogen); 1% BSA (w/v); 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature. Livers were incubated overnight, brains and spinal cord for 48 hours at 4°C with rat anti-mouse F4/80 (1:300, cat no: MCA497GA, Biorad), rabbit anti-mouse Iba1 (1:300; cat no: 019-19741, Wako), chicken anti-GFP for YFP detection (1:500, cat no: A10262, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-pHis3 (1:100, cat no: sc-8656-R, Santa Cruz), goat anti-IL-1b (1:40, cat no: AF-401-SP, R&D), rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (1:100, cat no: #4370, Cell signaling), rabbit anti-Collagen IV (1:100, cat no: 2150-1470, Biorad), rabbit anti-Collagen VI (1:200, cat no: ab6588, Abcam), rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase3 (1:600, cat no: #9661, Cell Signaling), rat anti-Ki-67 (1:200, cat no: 14-5698-80, eBioscience). Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:500, Invitrogen), anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen), anti-rat Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500, Invitrogen), anti-goat Alexa Fluor 568. Samples were then mounted with Fluoromount mounting medium with DAPI (eBiosciences) and visualized using a LSM880 Zeiss microscope with 20×/0.5 (dry) and 40×/1.4 (oil) performing a tile scan and Z-stack on whole tissue at a 512 × 512 or 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution. Image analysis and cell quantification was performed using Imaris (Bitplane) software. For paraffin sections, 3 µm sections were prepared before staining with H&E, Trichrome, and luxol fast blue (LFB-PAS). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-CD68 (5 µg/ml, Boster Biological Technology, cat. no: PA1518), rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (1 µg/ml, cat no: #4370, Cell signaling), chicken anti-GFP for YFP detection (1:5000, cat no: AB13970, Abcam), mouse anti-APP (1:3000, cat no: MAB348, Millipore), rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:500, cat no: 019-19741, Wako), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:200, cat. no. Z0334, Dako), mouse anti-NeuN (1:200, cat. no. MAB377, Merck Millipore), rat anti-LAMP-2 (1:250, ab13524, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-pERK1/2 (1:200, sc-136521, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-homer1 (1:200, cat. no. 160003, Synaptic Systems), mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:500, cat. no. 101 011, Synaptic Systems). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary Alexa- or HRP-conjugated antibodies were added at 1:200 in antibody buffer for 2 hr at room temperature. For immunofluorescent stainings nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, cat. no. 236276, Boehringer). All slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken using a Zeiss Lab.A1 or BZ-9000 Biorevo microscope (Keyence) and analyzed using the BZ-II Analyzer (Keyence). For quantification of cell numbers, at least three parasagittal sections per mouse were analyzed. In cases, where the cell density was too high and single cells could not be quantified, we quantified the immunolabeled area size per brain section. To determine synapse density, imaging was performed using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 20 × 0.95 NA objective. Z -stacks with 0.05-µm steps in the z direction, 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution, were recorded and analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Colocalization of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin with the postsynaptic marker Homer1 was quantified.

Written informed consent was obtained from histiocytosis patients for DNA/RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical studies according to Helsinki convention, and this study received approval from the Institutional Review Board at MSKCC (IRB Protocol 06-107). For all ECD patients, ECD was diagnosed in light of published guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of ECD 41 . Biopsy material was retrieved from the pathology archives at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Immunohistochemistry of human ECD and control tissue (see Supplementary Table 6 ) was carried out on 3–4 µm thick paraffin sections, fixed with PFA. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin sections with rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:500, cat no: 019-19741, Wako) and mouse anti-pERK1/2 (1:200, sc-136521, Santa Cruz), or mouse anti-CD163 (0.06ug/mL, cat#760-4437, Cell Marque), rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (1µg/ml, cat no: #4370, Cell Signaling) and mouse anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) (1:800, cat no: #E19294, clone VE1, Spring). Secondary Alexa- or HRP-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen) were added at 1:200. Images were taken with a Zeiss Lab.A1, BondIII (Leica-Microsystems, Buffalo Groove, IL), BZ-9000 BIOREVO microscope (Keyence) and analyzed using the BZ-II Analyzer (Keyence), or with a LSM880 Zeiss microscope with 40×/1.4 (oil) performing a tile scan and Z-stack on whole tissue at a 512 × 512 or 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution and manually analyzed using Imaris (Bitplane) software.

Tissues were homogenized using a cell lysis kit (Biorad) and a Precellys homogenizer. Primary antibodies were added overnight at a dilution 1:1000 for rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (cat no: #4370, Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (cat no: #9102, Cell Signaling), and 1:5000 mouse anti-beta actin (cat no: #ab6276, abcam). Secondary antibody anti-rabbit HRP (cat no: #7074, Cell Signaling) or anti-mouse AP (cat no: #AP-2000, Vector laboratories) was added for 1 hour at a dilution of 1:2000. Detection of HRP was performed using Pierce ECL Western Blotting substrate (cat no: #32106). Detection of AP vas performed using BCIP/NBT substratekit (cat no: #SK-5400, Vector laboratories). For quantification, a ratio was made of the total integrated optical density (IOD) of pERK bands to the IOD of bands of the corresponding total ERK protein using ImageJ.

Proteins were extracted from 25 mg of tissue using Bio-Plex cell lysis kit. Cytokine concentrations were measured using Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay according to manufacturers protocol.

70–75uL of serum were analyzed for liver enzymes using Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry analyzer.

Analysis of PLX4720 concentrations in brain, liver and serum was performed in collaboration with Plexxikon Inc. 25 µl serum and 20 mg of homogenized tissue were measured using a standard curve that was generated by adding known amounts of PLX4720 to an untreated serum or homogenized sample.

Data are shown as mean with individual values per mouse being represented as circles, unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance was analyzed with Graph Pad Prism by using Mann-Whitney tests, unpaired two-tailed t-tests, 1-way and 2-way ANOVA and Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test as indicated in the figure legends. The n value represents biological replicates. For RNA-seq statistical analysis R software was used (see Generation and analysis of Kupffer cells and microglia of RNA-seq in BRAF VE and BRAF WT littermate controls and Generation and analysis of human brain RNA-seq ). Significance was considered at p < 0.05. Animals that were labeled moribund by veterinarian services had to be euthanized and were therefore excluded from further longitudinal analyses as indicated in the figure legends. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate overall survival and cumulative incidence rate. Experiments were repeated to ensure reproducibility of the observations. Equal variance was assumed for cell counting experiments. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

Gene expression data is deposited on the GEO database (accession number GSE95734). The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Circles represent values for individual mice. One-way ANOVA. * p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. (c) Immunofluorescent analysis of pERK in F4/80 + Kupffer cells from 5–8 month-old BRAF VE . Results are representative for n=3. (d) Serum analysis of BRAF VE mice (score 1, n=6) and their littermates controls (n=6). ALB: albumin, ALP: alkaline phosphatase, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase. (e) Gross liver, lung, kidney and spleen structure (HE, Trichrome) of paralyzed BRAF VE and BRAF WT . Representative of n=7 per genotype. Scale bars=200µm (10µm for insets). (f) Liver and spleen gross organs from paralyzed BRAF VE and BRAF WT . Representative of n=5 per genotype.

(a) Table summarizing observed pathological and molecular findings in brain tissue of three ECD patients with neurologic presentations. BRAF status was determined by immunohistochemical analysis and by sequencing. Neuronal loss and demyelination was determined by immunohistochemistry of neurofilament and myelin basic protein (MBP). RF: Rosenthal fiber. n/a: not applicable/no tissue available for further analysis. (b) Immunohistochemistry and immmunofluorescent analysis of ECD brain tissue for CD163, pERK and BRAF V600E (anti-BRAFVE1 antibody). Upper panel scale bar=200µm. Lower panel scale bar=5µm. (c) Immunohistochemistry analysis of ECD brain tissue for neurofilament and MBP shows areas of myelin deficits with preserved axons in the same region. Scale bar=200µm.
