# Title
Sex-Specific Effects of Apolipoprotein E on Cerebrospinal Fluid
Levels of Tau

# Abstract
The strongest genetic risk factor for AD, the apolipoprotein E
( APOE ) gene, has a stronger association among females
compared to males. Yet, limited work has evaluated the association between APOE alleles and markers of AD neuropathology in a
sex-specific manner. Evaluate sex differences in the association between APOE and markers of AD neuropathology measured in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during life or in brain tissue at autopsy. This meta-analysis selected data from 10 longitudinal cohort studies
of normal aging and AD. Cohorts had variable recruitment criteria and
follow-up intervals, and included population based and clinic based samples.
Inclusion in our analysis required APOE genotype data and
either CSF data (n=1798, 48% female, 13% AD, 94% Caucasian, 70±9
years) or autopsy data (n=5,109, 56% female, 97% Caucasian, 84±9
years) available for analysis. Biomarker analyses included levels of Aβ−42, total tau
(t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measured in CSF. Autopsy analyses
included CERAD staging for neuritic plaques and Braak staging for
neurofibrillary tangles. After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni
procedure, we observed a statistically significant interaction between APOE- ε4 and sex on CSF t-tau (β=0.41 [95%
CI: 0.27, 0.55], p<0.001) and p-tau (β=0.24 [0.09, 0.38],
p=0.001), whereby APOE showed a stronger association among
females compared to males. Post hoc analyses suggested this sex difference
was present in amyloid positive individuals (β=0.41 [0.20, 0.62],
p<0.001), but not among amyloid negative individuals (β=0.06
[−0.18, 0.31], p=0.62). We did not observe sex differences in the
association between APOE and Aβ−42, neuritic
plaque burden, or neurofibrillary tangle burden. We provide robust evidence of a stronger association between APOE- ε4 and CSF tau levels among females
compared to males across multiple independent datasets. Interestingly, APOE- ε4 is not differentially associated with
autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. Together, the sex difference in
the association between APOE and CSF measures of tau, and
the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles
at autopsy, suggests that APOE may modulate risk for
neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of
amyloidosis.

## Introduction
Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) is the strongest genetic risk factor
for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), 1 explaining approximately 13% of the phenotypic
variance. 2 The ε4 allele
increases risk for AD in a dose-dependent manner, and the strength of the
association varies by age and sex. 3 The effect of APOE -ε4 is strongest prior to age 70, declines
after age 85, and is more robust among females compared to males, 3 especially females between 55–70
years of age. 4 Although this sex
difference has been well established after a recent comprehensive
meta-analysis, 4 very little is
known about the underlying mechanism. APOE has been implicated in a
variety of neuropathological cascades relevant to AD, including alterations in
cerebral glucose metabolism, 5 , 6 cerebrovascular disease, 7 amyloidosis, 8 , 9 neurodegeneration, 10 and tau tangle pathology. 11 The present manuscript will focus on
amyloid and tau as potential contributors to sex differences in the clinical effects
of APOE.

In the case of amyloid pathology, APOE -ε4 has a
strong association with amyloidosis, 8 , 9 even among non-demented older adults, 12 likely through its role in amyloid
clearance. 13 Research
leveraging in vivo biomarkers of amyloid has indicated that the
association between APOE- ε4 and amyloidosis is consistent
across sexes, 8 , 14 – 16 yet other work has found evidence of
age-dependent sex differences in the effects of APOE- ε4 on
amyloidosis. 17 , 18 In the case of tau pathology, APOE -ε4 is associated with higher levels of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) tau, 19 and more
neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy, 11 although these associations are relegated to individuals
with high levels of amyloid pathology. 16 The evidence of a sex difference in the association
between APOE and tau pathology is also mixed, with some
biomarker 15 , 19 and autopsy 18 work suggesting females show a more robust
association between APOE- ε4 and tau, while other work has
reported no sex difference. 14 , 20 , 21

Collectively, the amyloid and tau findings to date provide mounting, although
inconclusive, evidence of a sex difference in the association between APOE and both of the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD.
The objective of the present project was to provide a comprehensive understanding of
the sex-specific associations between APOE and AD neuropathology in
older adulthood. The pooled data resources for this project provide the opportunity
to evaluate sex differences across the spectrum of normal aging and AD, including a
broad range of age and cognitive status. The first set of analyses focused on four in vivo datasets that include CSF biomarkers of AD
neuropathology. The second set focused on 6 autopsy datasets of AD leveraging direct
measures of AD neuropathology. Together, these analyses provide a thorough and
needed investigation into sex-specific effects of APOE on AD
neuropathology.

## Materials and Methods
Data were acquired from well characterized studies of AD ( Tables 1 and 2 ).
The biomarker database included four cohort studies. The Vanderbilt Memory &
Aging Project ( VMAP ), launched in 2012, recruited
participants age 60 and older from the community who were MRI eligible and free of
dementia and clinical stroke. 22 The Wisconsin Registry of Alzheimer’s Prevention
( WRAP ) began in 2001 recruiting participants 40–65
years of age. 72% have a parent with either probable AD dementia ascertained through
medical history review or autopsy-confirmed AD. 23 The Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal
Individuals ( BIOCARD ) study began in 1995. Enrollees were
middle age at baseline and cognitively intact; 75% of participants had a first
degree relative with AD. The study stopped in 2005 and was re-established in 2009,
with annual assessments. 24 The
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI )
launched in 2003 and includes over 1,500 adults aged 55 to 90 years with normal
cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD ( www.adni-info.org ).

The autopsy database was derived from data published by Beecham et al.
evaluating genetic markers of AD neuropathology, which includes cohort
descriptions. 25 The
Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN), National Institute on Aging (NIA)
Late–Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Family Study (LOAD), and Mayo Clinic
(Mayo) were analyzed directly from the published data. 25 The dataset was updated using more recent
data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP),
the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, and the National Alzheimer Coordinating
Center (NACC) dataset. Briefly, ROS began in 1994 and
involves older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers recruited from across the US.
Rush MAP began in 1997 and involves older lay persons
recruited from retirement communities, subsidized housing facilities, and social
service agencies in the Chicago metropolitan area. Persons in both studies enrolled
without dementia and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and organ donation at
death. 26 , 27 ACT began in 1994 and recruited a random sample of
non-demented older adults from the Seattle metropolitan area. A subset of
participants in ACT (25–30%) also agreed to brain donation. 28 NACC maintains a database of participant information
collected from 34 past and present NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers. In 2005,
NACC implemented a standard protocol (i.e., Uniform Dataset, UDS), including
clinical, medical, neurological, and cognitive data. We only included autopsy
participants who were at least 60 years of age at death. The collection of VMAP data
and secondary analyses of all data were approved by the Vanderbilt University
Medical Center IRB.

As previously reported, 29 APOE haplotypes (ε2, ε3, ε4) were
determined using SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 in ACT, BIOCARD, Mayo, NACC, NIA-LOAD,
VMAP, and WRAP. Pyrosequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis, and high-throughput sequencing of APOE codons 112 and
158 were performed in ADNI, ROS/MAP, and TGEN datasets to derive APOE haplotypes.

CSF biomarkers have been measured in ADNI, BIOCARD, WRAP, and VMAP
previously. ADNI 30 and
BIOCARD 31 were analyzed by
the same lab using the same procedure. Similarly, WRAP 32 and VMAP 22 were analyzed by the same lab using the same
procedure. Given known batch effects, we analyzed variables as continuous
square-root transformed outcomes within each dataset individually and used a
meta-analysis based on standardized coefficients to summarize results across
datasets.

Within the autopsy datasets, we used a measure of neurofibrillary
tangles (NFT; Braak staging) 33 and a measure of neuritic plaques (CERAD neuritic plaque score) 34 in each dataset. Both measures were
analyzed as binary outcomes and as ordinal outcomes. The binary neuritic plaque
positive score was defined based on CERAD, whereby scores of
“none” or “sparse” neuritic plaques were considered
“neuritic plaque negative”, and scores of “moderate”
or “frequent” neuritic plaques were considered “neuritic
plaque positive”. The binary NFT positive score was defined based on
Braak staging, whereby stages none, I, or II were considered “NFT
negative” and stages III, IV, V, or VI were considered “NFT
positive”.

Statistical analyses were completed using RStudio (Version 1.0.136; https://www.rstudio.com/ ). For the
neuropathology analyses, two primary models were run. The first was a binary
logistic regression with tangle positivity or neuritic plaque positivity set as
the outcome. The second model was a proportional odds ordinal logistic
regression setting either Braak stage or CERAD neuritic plaque score as the
ordinal outcome. Predictors in the model included age at death, sex, APOE , and a sex x APOE interaction. APOE- ε2 and APOE- ε4 were
evaluated in separate models, and the main effect models were assessed excluding
the sex x APOE interaction term. We used a dominant model for
ε2 and an additive model for ε4. Follow-up analyses were run
stratified by sex. All models were run within each dataset individually.

For the biomarker analyses, the same prediction models and covariates
were assessed using linear regression with baseline CSF Aβ−42, CSF
total tau (t-tau), or CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) set as the continuous
outcome. Age at CSF acquisition was used as the age covariate term. Follow-up
models were run stratified by sex. All models were run within each dataset
individually.

Meta-analyses within the CSF and autopsy cohorts were completed
separately using the metafor package in R, including estimation of fixed effects
and heterogeneity across datasets. Correction for multiple comparisons was
performed using the Bonferroni procedure accounting for main effects and
interactions on three biomarker outcomes (CSF Aβ−42, t-tau, and
p-tau) and four autopsy outcomes (ordinal and binary outcomes of CERAD and Braak
staging) resulting in 35 independent tests (corrected-α=0.0014).

Post-hoc analyses evaluated sex x APOE- ε4
interactions on CSF t-tau and p-tau among amyloid positive and amyloid negative
individuals. Additional post-hoc analyses restricted the sample to cognitively
normal individuals, stratified by age group, covaried for education level,
restricted autopsy results to longitudinal cohort studies, removed ADNI from the
CSF analyses, and restricted to APOE -ε4 homozygotes.

## Results
Participant characteristics are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . The biomarker
dataset included individuals who were, on average, younger, with a higher percentage
of males than the autopsy datasets.

Main effect results are presented in Table 3 . Females showed higher levels of CSF t-tau, CERAD neuritic
plaque score, and Braak tau tangle stage. Similarly, APOE- ε4 was associated with higher levels of biomarker
levels and pathology and ε2 was associated with lower biomarker levels
and pathology for all metrics.

Interaction results are presented in Table 3 . A sex x APOE- ε4 interaction was
observed on both t-tau ( Figure 1 ) and p-tau
whereby the association between APOE- ε4 and tau levels
was stronger in females than in males (see Figure
2 ).

Autopsy interaction results are also presented in Table 3 . There were no significant interactions
between sex and APOE on neuropathology.

In post-hoc analyses stratified by amyloid status, the sex x APOE- ε4 interaction was present among amyloid
positive individuals (β=0.41 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.62], p<0.001, Supplemental Table 1 ) but
not amyloid negative individuals (β=0.06 [−0.18, 0.31], p=0.62, Supplemental Table
2 ). Additional post-hoc analyses stratified by age, restricting the
sample to cognitively normal individuals, adjusting for education, restricted to
longitudinal cohort studies, removing the ADNI dataset, and restricted to APOE- ε4 homozygotes are presented in Supplemental Tables 3–9 .

## Discussion
The present findings provide the most robust evidence to date of sex
differences in the association between APOE -ε4 and CSF tau
levels, whereby the effect of APOE is stronger among females
compared to males. The observed sex difference was driven by amyloid positive
individuals, suggesting APOE may confer sex-specific risk for
downstream neurodegeneration in the presence of enhanced amyloidosis. In contrast to
CSF tau levels, we did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and any biomarkers of amyloidosis or autopsy measures of
neurofibrillary tangles.

The present analyses provide strong evidence of an enhanced association
between APOE- ε4 and CSF tau levels among females compared to
males, particularly among amyloid positive females. Previous work in ADNI has
reported similar sex differences in CSF tau, 14 , 20 although results have been somewhat mixed depending on
the sample included 21 and had
never been replicated in an independent cohort. For the first time, we were able to
replicate the sex difference of APOE effects on CSF tau in three
additional datasets that differ substantially in baseline age and diagnostic status.
We also provide evidence of a comparable sex difference in the association between APOE- ε4 and CSF phosphorylated tau for the first time.
Several mechanisms could underlie this sex difference in tau, and the hormonal
changes that take place during and following menopause represent one strong
candidate pathway. For example, there is evidence that changes in estrogen levels
among females could drive a more severe downstream response to amyloidosis; 35 – 37 an effect that could be enhanced among
ε4 carriers given evidence that estradiol treatment drives APOE release from microglia. 38 A second possibility is that late-life changes in
estrogen levels among females have a direct effect on tau. For example, estradiol
appears to protect against tau hyperphosphorylation, particularly among female
rats, 39 and estrogen receptor
α co-localizes with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy 40 . Interestingly, the α receptor also
appears to be responsible for the estrogen-mediated upregulation of APOE expression, 41 suggesting a third possible mechanism in which estrogen
and APOE act synergistically in post-menopausal women. Thoughtful,
modern experimental approaches are needed to better understand the potential
contribution of gonadal hormone differences between men and women in driving the
observed APOE sex differences. 42

In contrast to the CSF biomarker results, we did not observe a sex
difference in the association between APOE and neurofibrillary
tangle load at autopsy. There are a few potential explanations for this
counterintuitive observation. Notably, there is growing evidence that CSF tau is a
better marker of the intensity of neurodegeneration than the stage of
neurofibrillary tangle deposition, 43 suggesting the autopsy and biomarker metrics may represent
two distinct processes. Therefore, one possibility is that sex-specific effects of APOE contribute to differences in neurodegeneration that are
not directly mediated by changes in neurofibrillary tangle burden. Other markers of
neurodegeneration, including hippocampal volume 44 , 45 and cerebral hypometabolism, 21 show sex-specific effects of APOE- ε4 that may underlie the observed differences in
CSF tau levels. A second possibility is that the age difference between the autopsy
cohorts and biomarker cohorts in the present analysis contribute to the observed
discrepancy between CSF and autopsy measures of tau. Recent and historic evidence
indicates that both the detrimental effect of APOE -ε4 and
the sex difference in APOE -ε4 effect diminishes among the
oldest old, 3 , 4 suggesting that subtle age
differences could have a large influence on results. In support of such a
possibility, we do observe the strongest effects on CSF tau in the younger
individuals when stratifying the CSF sample into younger-old and older-old adults
( Supplemental Tables
3–4 ). However, even among the younger-old adults we do not observe
a sex-specific effect of APOE on autopsy metrics, suggesting this
age difference does not fully account for the discrepancy.

In all analyses, we observed a strong association between APOE and amyloidosis that was consistent across males and
females. APOE appears to drive risk for clinical AD through an
amyloid clearance pathway, 13 so it
is not surprising that both here and previously 46 APOE shows a stronger association with amyloid deposition than tau.
Notably, we did not observe differences in the APOE association
when comparing younger-old to older-old individuals (see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ), although age differences
have been reported. 47 The larger
sample (and enhanced power) in the present analysis likely explains the discrepant
findings, as the previous study observed patterns consistent with our findings but
failed to observe a statistically significance association in the younger group.
Importantly, our primary and post-hoc analyses support the notion that APOE shows a consistent association with amyloidosis across sex
and age and is unlikely to drive observed sex differences in the association between APOE and clinical AD. 48

This manuscript has multiple strengths, including the large sample size, the
integration of both CSF biomarker data and autopsy data, and the extensive
sensitivity analyses, including explorations into diagnostic status, age, amyloid
status, and educational attainment. However, the study is not without weaknesses.
One important limitation is the potential influence of sex differences in survival
to older adulthood, which could contribute to a robust survivor effect among males
compared to females. As others have previously highlighted, selective survival of
men with substantially lower cardiovascular risk profiles may contribute to sex
differences in AD risk in older adulthood. 49 It is also notable that the sex-specific effect of APOE -ε4 on microbleeds is actually in the inverse
direction, 50 with males
showing a stronger association than females, suggesting that sex-specific effects of APOE- ε4 may have differential effects on AD and non-AD
pathologies, even in the face of potential survivor bias. Future work is needed to
develop and integrate modern statistical approaches to estimate and account for the
effect of survival bias, particularly in analyses of sex-specific molecular drivers
of AD and non-AD neuropathologies. The cross-sectional nature of the biomarker and
autopsy data also limits our ability to make causal inferences, particularly with
respect to the sequential ordering of neuropathologies or CSF biomarker deposition.
Finally, the cohorts were relatively homogeneous across race and ethnicity, with
some cohorts being exclusively Caucasian. Thus, findings may not be generalizable to
other racial and ethnic groups that may be at greater risk of AD. Results will need
to be extended to cohorts with greater diversity.

The present results provide strong evidence of sex differences in the
association between APOE and CSF tau levels that do not appear
to reflect differences in neurofibrillary tangle deposition. Future work should
evaluate the genetic drivers of plaques, tangles, neurodegeneration, and
cognitive impairment in a sex-specific manner to identify novel pathways of
risk.
