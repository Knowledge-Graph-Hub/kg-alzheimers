Living Neurons with Tau Filaments Aberrantly Expose Phosphatidylserine and Are Phagocytosed by
Microglia

# Abstract
Tau protein forms insoluble filamentous inclusions that are closely associated with nerve cell death in many
neurodegenerative diseases. How neurons die in these tauopathies is unclear. We report that living neurons with tau inclusions
from P301S-tau mice expose abnormally high amounts of phosphatidylserine because of the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Consequently, co-cultured phagocytes (BV2 cells or primary microglia) identify and phagocytose the living neurons, thereby
engulfing insoluble tau inclusions. To facilitate engulfment, neurons induce contacting microglia to secrete the opsonin
milk-fat-globule EGF-factor-8 (MFGE8) and nitric oxide (NO), whereas neurons with tau inclusions are rescued when MFGE8 or NO
production is prevented. MFGE8 expression is elevated in transgenic P301S-tau mouse brains with tau inclusions and in tau
inclusion-rich brain regions of several human tauopathies, indicating shared mechanisms of disease. Preventing phagocytosis of
living neurons will preserve them for treatments that inhibit tau aggregation and toxicity.

## INTRODUCTION
The assembly of tau protein into abnormal inclusions underlies many human neurodegenerative diseases ( Spillantini and Goedert, 2013 ), but how neurons die in tauopathies is still unknown. Transgenic mice that
express neuron-specific human mutant 0N4R P301S-tau reproduce much of the tau pathology observed in a family with frontotemporal
dementia due to a P301S-tau mutation ( Bugiani et al., 1999 ), with neurons in the central and
peripheral nervous systems developing filamentous tau inclusions and progressive neurodegeneration between 3 and 5 months of age
(Allen etal., 2002; Mellone etal., 2013). Peripheral neurons are also affected in human tauopathies ( Kawasaki et al., 1987 ; Nishimura et al., 1993 ), making them a relevant model of
disease. We reported that the pentameric oligothiophene dye pFTAA specifically detects filamentous tau aggregates in dorsal root gan-
glion (DRG) neurons from P301S-tau mice ( Brelstaff et al., 2015a , 2015b ), enabling investigation of how tau aggregates may lead to cell death. Observing pFTAA + cultured DRG neurons showed that they are slowly removed, without showing signs of apoptosis or necroptosis ( Brelstaff et al., 2015a ). Such slow kinetics accord with phagocytic cell death of live neurons by microglia
( Neher et al., 2011 ). Glial cells, particularly microglia, are thought to be crucial in
neurodegeneration ( Salter and Stevens, 2017 ; Spangenberg and
Green, 2017 ). Microglial activation has been associated with tau aggregation in frontotemporal dementia (FTDP-17T) ( Bellucci et al., 2011 ) and P301S-tau mouse brains ( Bellucci et al.,
2004 ) and has also been implicated in tau spreading through phagocytosis ( Bolos et al.,
2016 ; Ma- phis et al., 2015 ).

Death of cells through phagocytosis occurs extensively ( Brown et al., 2015 ) and is
required for programmed cell death in C. elegans ( Johnsen and Horvitz, 2016 ).
Most studies of neuronal cell death through microglial phagocytosis have relied on the induction of phagocytic activity by
inflammatory signals ( Brown and Neher, 2014 ). Inflammatory microglia instigate living neurons
to expose the ‘‘eat me’’ signal phosphatidylserine (PS) and perform phagocytosis through release of
opsonins (e.g., MFGE8). MFGE8 simultaneously binds target-exposed PS ( Hanayama et al., 2002 )
and phagocytic αvβ3 vitronectin receptors, causing cytoskeletal rearrangements that facilitate target engulfment.
Whether non-apoptotic exposure of PS occurs on diseased neurons and whether it activates microglial inflammation and phagocytosis are
unknown.

We have investigated how tau inclusion-bearing neurons die, showing that live neurons with aggregated tau produce sufficient
reactive oxygen species (ROS) to externalize PS and activate microglial phagocytosis. Preventing key steps in this pathway leads to
the rescue of living neurons.

## RESULTS
Neurons cultured from 5-month-old P301S-tau mice (P301S mice) were probed with the PS-binding protein annexin V
(AnnV-Alexa Fluor 647) and cell-impermeable nuclear dyes. Living DRG neurons with pFTAA + tau inclusions displayed
significantly more externalized PS compared with pFTAA + neurons that also expressed P301S-tau (detected with anti-human
tau HT7; Figures 1A and 1B ; p < 0.0001). PS exposure was highest in cultures
containing P301S-tau + neurons from 5-month-old mice, while significantly lower AnnV labeling was present in DRG neurons
cultured from 5-month-old C57BL/6 (C57) control mice, tau + ortau - neuronsfrom 2-month-old P301Smice, which
express hyperphosphorylated forms of P301S-tau but do not contain filamentoustau aggregates ( Delobel etal., 2008 ; Mellone et al., 2013 ), and tau + or
tau - neurons from 5-month-old Alz17 mice that express wild-type 2N4R human tau but do not develop tau aggregates
( Brelstaff et al., 2015a ; Probst et al., 2000 )
( Figure 1C ; p < 0.001 5-month-old P301S-tau HT7 + versus all
others).

pFTAA/AnnV + neurons were viable, as assessed by these criteria: (1) impermeability to nuclear dyes (PI, Figure 1D ; DAPI, Figure S1A ), in
contrast to strong staining of fixed/permeable cells; (2) retention of calcein-AM, similar to pFTAA - neurons, in
contrast to fixed/permeable cells showing no calcein-AM labeling ( Figure 1D ); and (3) no
active caspase-3, which drives PS exposure on apoptotic cells ( Nagata et al., 2016 ) ( Figure 1E ), in contrast to caspase-3-dependent exposure of PS on all neurons exposed to
pro-apoptotic staurosporine (Sts; 250 nM) ( Figure 1E ). Also, only Sts-induced PS exposure,
but not that induced by P301S-tau, was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(0-methyl)-FMK (BAF) ( Figure S1B ). Staining with pFTAA was not the cause of PS exposure, as enhanced AnnV
staining intensity was present prior to pFTAA application ( Figure S1C ).
Thus, pFTAA + neurons with exposed PS are alive.

To investigate what drives PS exposure, we measured ROS production, as ROS can activate PS transporters ( Sarkar et al., 2015 ; Schreiber et al., 2018 ), and oxidized PS is
a powerful pro-phagocytic signal ( Tyurin et al., 2014 ). DRG neurons with P301S-tau
aggregates displayed significantly higher dihydroe- thidium (DHE) fluorescence compared with pFTAA - neurons in the same
cultures ( Figures 2A and 2B ; p < 0.0001), indicating higher ROS production. Moreover,
PS exposure was ROS dependent, as preincubation with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L- cysteine (NAC) or TEMPOL for 48 hr reduced AnnV
binding values compared to untreated pFTAA + neurons ( Figure 2C ; p < 0.0001,
untreated pFTAA + neurons vs all). In contrast, the pro-oxidant arsenite induced rapid PS exposure in the absence of
cell permeabilization or death in all neurons ( Figure 2C ). Thus, ROS production associated
with tau aggregates is a component of the signaling pathway that leads to PS externalization in P301S-tau neurons but is
insufficient to cause cell death, unlike ROS-driven ferroptosis/oxytosis ( Tan et al., 2001 ; Yang and Stockwell, 2016 ).

To investigate if cultures containing neurons that display PS would activate phagocytes, microglial-derived BV2 cells were
co-cultured in contact with DRG neurons for 4 days before the cells and media were analyzed for nitric oxide (NO) and MFGE8
production, MFGE8 having been shown to be a key opsonin via PS binding in the nervous system ( Boddaert et al., 2007 ; Kranich et al., 2010 ; Neher et al., 2011 ). DRG neurons from 5-month-old P301S mice induced a significant increase in the expression and
secretion of MFGE8 ( Figures 3A–3C ) specifically in cultures containing neurons with
P301S-tau aggregates, as no increase in its expression was detected when BV2 cells were co-cultured with DRG neurons from
5-month-old Alz17 or C57 mice or 2-month-old P301S mice. Importantly, DRG neurons cultured from 5-month-old P301S mice also
induced the release of MFGE8 from co-cultured primary microglia (containing 90% microglia and 10% astrocytes) from C57 mice, MFGE8
concentration being ~6-fold higher than that measured from equivalent numbers of BV2 cells ( Figure
3E ). No MFGE8 was detected in medium conditioned by microglia alone or microglia from negative-control MFGE8 knockout
(KO) mice ( Silvestre et al., 2005 ).

NO was also significantly elevated (~3-fold) in medium conditioned by neurons from 5-month-old P301S mice co-cultured with
BV2 cells ( Figure 3D ), but no increase was detected in cocultures of BV2 cells with neurons
from 5-month-old Alz17 or C57 mice or 2-month-old P301S mice. More NO was also released when neurons from 5-month-old P301S mice
were co-cultured with primary microglia from C57 mice, but there was no increase in its release from MFGE8 KO microglia ( Figure 3F ), suggesting a mutual mechanism of induction between NO- and MFGE8-initiated
signaling pathways. Notably, no increase in MFGE8 in BV2 cell lysates or in released MFGE8 or NO was detected when BV2 cells were
co-cultured in transwell inserts regardless of neuronal origins ( Figures 3A–3D ),
indicating a requirement for close contact between neurons and microglia to achieve activation of NO and MFGE8 production.

To assess the intensity and the specificity of stimulation by pFTAA + neurons, BV2 cells were treated with 100
ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hr and washed prior to their addition to the various neuronal cultures ( Figure S2 ). LPS induced similarly elevated amounts of MFGE8 and NO regardless of
neuron source or placement of BV2 cells in contact or transwell inserts. Thus, cultures of neurons with tau inclusions that expose
PS provide a microglial stimulus that is as robust as that of LPS, assessed by MFGE8 and NO production.

To demonstrate the relevance of the results from the culture systems to the in vivo conditions, brain
sections from C57 and P301S mice were stained for the presence of MFGE8 and protein extracts from cortex, brain stem, and
cerebellum were analyzed for MFGE8 expression. Less MFGE8 immunoreac- tivity was evident in the cortex of C57 mice compared with
that of P301S mice, though some immunostaining was present in the C57 brains compared with MFGE8 KO controls ( Figure 3G ). Similarly, extracts from the brains of 5-month-old P301S mice contained significantly higher
amounts of MFGE8 compared with lysates from age-matched C57 or Alz17 mice band intensities being slightly higher than background
staining in MFGE8 KO lysates ( Figures 3H and 3I ). Expression of MFGE8 was especially
prominent in the brain stem, in which a high number of neurons with tau aggregates is found ( Allen
et al., 2002 ).

To determine whether a similar pattern of activation occurs in human tauopathies, we compared the expression of MFGE8 in
brain extracts from the frontal cortex of healthy human controls and three cases each of inherited tauopathies (P301L and +3
mutations in MAPT ; Hutton et al., 1998 ; Mirra et al., 1999 ; Spill- antini et al., 1997 ) and three cases of sporadic
Pick’s disease (case details in STAR Methods). Increased MFGE8 expression was found in the cortical extracts of all human
tauopathy cases compared with healthy controls ( Figure 3J ). MFGE8 was barely detected in the
cerebellum of P301L-tau cases, an area with little or no tau pathology. We also examined brain extracts from C9orf72 cases
containing TDP-43 pathology in the cortex but little tau, as detected by antibody AT8. No increase in MFGE8 was found in the
cortex or cerebellum of C9orf72 cases, consistent with the specific expression of MFGE8 in tauopathies and strengthening the
relevance of our findings in P301S mice for human disease.

We next investigated if phagocytes specifically engulf P301S- tau + neurons with tau inclusions. Figure 4A shows that when neurons were cultured in contact with BV2 cells, more than 50% of the
HT7 + neurons were lost after 4 days (p < 0.001). There was no loss of HT7 + neurons when BV2 cells
were co-cultured in a transwell, showing that physical contact was necessary for neuronal loss. In contrast, no HT7 + neuron loss was found when BV2 cells were co-cultured with neurons from 5-month- old Alz17 mice or 2-month-old P301S mice. The
extent of phagocytosis that followed BV2 activation by neurons was similar to that produced by LPS, in agreement with the similar
amounts of MFGE8 and NO produced by both stimuli ( Figure S2E ; p <
0.05). Importantly, microglia from the cortex of neonatal C57 mice caused a similar extent of neuronal loss as BV2 cells ( Figure 4B ; p < 0.05), whereas no neuronal loss occurred with microglia from MFGE8 KO
mice ( Figure 4B ). Macrophages prepared from bone marrow (BMDMs) of C57 mice also caused
neuron loss, while macrophages from MFGE8 KO mice did not ( Figure S2F ; p
< 0.01).

We noted several examples of IB4 + phagocytes in close proximity to cultured pFTAA + neurons and some
internalization of pFTAA + aggregates ( Figure 4C ). To examine whether endogenous
phagocytes were responsible for the loss of tau aggregate-containing neurons that occurs over 2–3 weeks, we eliminated the
phagocytes by treatment (4 hr) with leucine methyl ester (LME) ( Jebelli et al., 2015 ),
followed by an overnight incubation to ensure death of phagocytes. We found that ~90% of the pFTAA + neurons were
maintained after phagocytes were eliminated from the cultures, whereas only ~70% of the neurons remained in untreated cultures
after 14 days ( Figure 4D ; p < 0.0001). Because it was reported recently that living
necrop- totic cells also externalize PS ( Zargarian et al., 2017 ), we tested whether the
neurons were dying by necroptosis. In contrast to the abolition of neuron loss caused by LME, neuron loss was not prevented by the
RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 ( Degterev et al., 2008 ), indicating that neuron loss was not
due to necroptosis ( Figure S4 ). Thus, four types of phagocytes (BV2
cells, primary microglia, BMDMs, and resident phagocytes) are activated by pFTAA + neurons that then phagocytose them,
thereby causing neuronal loss.

To further demonstrate phagocytosis of pFTAA + neurons with tau inclusions by microglia, we pre-labeled BV2
cells with IB4- Alexa Fluor 594 before adding them to pFTAA pre-labeled neurons from 5-month-old P301S or C57 mice. Both cell
types were washed extensively before co-culture to remove free dyes. After 4 days, BV2 cells were collected and sorted by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Figure 4E shows that a minor but significant
proportion of BV2 cells was double-labeled with pFTAA and IB4–594 in the population exposed to P301S- tau-derived DRG
neurons (4.9%, gated fraction P6), but none was present in the P6-gated population exposed to C57-derived DRG neurons, indicating
that the BV2 cells had engulfed prelabeled tau inclusions. To confirm that the pFTAA + material inside BV2 cells was
insoluble tau, sorted cells were lysed in 5% SDS and filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane trap ( Figure 4F ). Tau from the P6-gated pFTAA/IB4 + population was retained on the filter, as
detected by HT7, but no tau was retained from the C57 P6-gated population or the P4-gated single- labeled BV2 population.
Sarkosyl-insoluble tau extracted from 5-month-old P301S mouse brain served as the positive control ( Allen et al., 2002 ). These data indicate that pFTAA + tau aggregates are transferred to BV2 cells during
their co-culture with pFTAA + DRG neurons, confirming that phagocytosis had occurred.

Many instances of pFTAA + P301S-tau were also detected in microglia in brains from 5-month-old P301S mice. Figure 4G shows an example of a double-labeled pFTAA/HT7 + neuron with an intact
nucleus inside an Iba1-stained microglial cell in the facial nucleus (FN). Engulfmentof the whole neuron is evident in the
confocal image ( Figure 4G ). Similar examples were present in the cortex from P301S mice
( Figure S4 ).

Brains from 5-month-old P301S mice showed significant alterations in microglial morphology in the FN and other areas of
the brain stem rich in tau aggregates, with marked increases in microglial proximity to neurons ( Figure 4H ), as previously noted ( Bellucci et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, the
neurons against which microglia were closest showed an altered morphology, although their nuclei retained a normal appearance. To
establish that the proximity of tau aggregate-bearing neurons to microglia was induced by the presence of P301S-tau, we mapped the
relative spatial distribution of neurons and microglia ( Figures 4I and 4J ). A clustered
pattern of microglia intermingled with neurons was evident in brains of P301S mice compared with C57 or MFGE8 KO mice ( Figure 4I ). Quantification showed that there was a 2-fold increase in the interaction strength
between microglia and neurons in P301S mice compared with C57 controls ( Figure 4J ). However,
microglia were also closely associated with the neurons ( Figure 4I , quantified in Figure 4J ) in 5-month-old double homozygous MFGE8 KO/P301S mice with tau aggregates. Thus, the
change in location of microglia depended more on the state of neurons containing P301S-tau aggregates than on MFGE8 per
se that instead seems necessary for phagocytosis.

To show further evidence that neurons with tau inclusions are eaten alive in an MFGE8-dependent manner, we co-cultured
neurons from 5-month-old P301S mice with BV2 cells and added either excess AnnV to mask neuronal PS ( Krahling et al., 1999 ; Neher et al., 2011 ) or the cyclo peptide
cRGD/V (cRGD), to mask MFGE8 RGD binding to the αv vitronectin receptor subunit ( Asano et
al., 2004 ). AnnV significantly reduced the loss of tau + (HT7 + ) neurons from the cultures (p
< 0.01), while the cRGD peptide showed a trend toward protection ( Figures 5A and 5D ).
Interestingly, both treatments reduced MFGE8 and NO secretion in the cocultures (Figures 5B ,
p < 0.01 and 5C , p < 0.001). Reduced phagocytosis was not due to a
priori inactivation of BV2 microglia by AnnV or the cRGD peptide, as neither compound reduced MFGE8 expression or
MFGE8 and NO release when added to LPS-activated cultures of BV2 cells ( Figures
S5A-S5C ). Hence, phagocytosis induced by the DRG neurons with tau inclusions requires MFGE8 and NO production in BV2
cells, which, when abrogated, leads to the rescue of living neurons.

Because AnnV and cRGD treatments inhibited both MFGE8 and NO production, we investigated whether direct inhibition of NO
production using inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibitors would also abrogate phagocytosis. The results show that N-(3-
(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W) or aminoguanidine (AG) significantly reduced the production of NO from BV2 cells induced
by neurons from 5-month-old P301S mice ( Figure 4I ; 1400W, p < 0.05; AG, p <
0.001) and that both compounds inhibited the loss of tau + neurons ( Figure 4G ;
1400W, p < 0.05; AG, p < 0.01). Moreover, the iNOS inhibitors also abrogated the production of MFGE8 ( Figure 4H ; p < 0.001), further demonstrating the reciprocity between NO signaling and MFGE8
production. Thus, NO induced in phagocytes by neurons with tau inclusions is an essential component of the phagocytic process.

## DISCUSSION
The presence of tau filaments is correlated with neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic tauopathies, but the mechanisms by
which assembled tau may cause neuronal cell death remain elusive ( Spillantini and Goedert,
2013 ). This study implicates neurons with intracellular filamentous tau aggregates in instigating a type of cell death whereby
living neurons under stress expose the ‘‘eat me’’ signal PS and activate phagocytic cells that recognize,
engulf, and dispose them while still alive. Our study adds neurons with tau inclusions to a growing list of cells that are
phagocytosed while still alive as a homeostatic mechanism to regulate cell numbers and remove potentially unfit cells ( Merino et al., 2015 ).

It has been suggested that neuronal cell death in neurode- generative diseases is the consequence of a breakdown of
cooperative processes between neurons and other cells, not least microglia ( De Strooper and Karran,
2016 ). Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain that sometimes interact beneficially with surrounding cells and
sometimes have deleterious effects, especially during inflammation ( Aguzzi et al., 2013 ; Boche et al., 2013 ). By instigating the exposure of PS, intracellular P301S-tau aggregates cause
microglia to release opsonins, which facilitate engulfment, and NO that can perpetuate an inflammatory state. In contrast to its
exposure in apoptosis, here PS could be re-internalized, emphasizing the fact that the neurons are alive, and it is phagocytosis that
kills them.

Interest is increasing in inflammation as contributing to neurodegeneration ( Bolos et al.,
2017 ). A role for innate immune factors has long been acknowledged in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ( Eikelenboom and Stam, 1982 ) and some tauopathies ( Singhrao et al.,
1996 ), but how neuroinflammation is instigated in diseases with intracellular protein aggregates in unclear. Here, neurons
with filamentous tau aggregates led to microglial activation through close contact, establishing a causal relationship between
intracellular aggregation and an inflammatory response. The signaling pathway starts in the neurons by tau aggregate- mediated ROS
production, causing neuronal PS exposure, followed by NO production in the phagocytes that regulates release of MFGE8 necessary for
phagocytosis (see Figure 5 for summary scheme). We further extend the model in which NO is
postulated to promote release of MFGE8 ( Hornik et al., 2016 ) by proposing that MFGE8 released
as a result of iNOS/NO stimulation feeds back onto the αvβ3 receptor to amplify iNOS/NO output. Indeed,
αvβ3 has been implicated in the activation of astrocytes, which also produce MFGE8 in the brain ( Lagos-Cabre et al., 2017 ). It is interesting that lack of MFGE8 did not prevent the proximity of microglia
to neurons in the facila nucleus of 5-month-old double crossed MFGE8 KO/P301S-tau +/+ mice. However, many other pairs of
signals are expressed on target cells and phagocytes that might facilitate proximity, even though MFGE8 is still required for
phagocytosis ( Neher et al., 2013 ; Rothlin et al., 2015 ).
Which of these signals predominate under each disease condition remains to be explored.

Phagocytosis of alive tau inclusion-bearing neurons may have implications for potential therapies. We found increased
expression of MFGE8 in the frontal cortex of FTD cases with MAPT mutations (P301L and FTDP+3) or sporadic
Pick’s disease but not in the cerebellum of P301L cases, showing that the expression level of MFGE8 depends on the presence of
tau aggregates. Preservation of neurons, albeit with tau inclusions, preserves a working network and provides a substrate for
potential therapies, which by altering aggregation and toxicity may well be able to prevent neuronal loss.

Mouse and human study protocols were approved by the Local Review and Ethics Committees (LREC) of University of
Cambridge and the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Homozygous mice transgenic for human mutant 0N4R P301S-tau or
wild- type human 2N4R tau (Alz17) ( Probst et al., 2000 ), and C57BL/6:OlaHsd (Harlan)
background-matched control mice were maintained as described previously ( Mellone et al.,
2013 ). MFGE8 KO mice express a mutant MFGE8 lacking one of the two obligatory vitronectin receptor binding sites
and a transmembrane sequence that tethers the protein in the ER membrane thereby abrogating its secretion ( Silvestre et al., 2005 ). MFGE8 KO mice were crossed with P301S-taumice in a C57BL/6:Jax background
to produce double homozygous MFGE8 KO/ P301S-tau+/+ mice. Both female and male mice were used and each individual was from a
different litter. Mice were housed in groups in individually ventilated cages, adding a cardboard roll and nesting material
for enrichment. Mice were kept under a 12 h light/dark cycle, with food and water available ad libitum. Mash
food was placed in the cage when the onset of pathology was evident, around 4 month of age. Our research was performed under
the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, Amendment Regulations 2012, following an ethical review by the University of
Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB).

Human brain tissue was obtained from The Alzheimer Disease Center, Indiana University School of Medicine and the
Cambridge Brain Bank. Grey matter (0.2 g) was mechanically homogenized in RIPA buffer containing 2.5% SDS with phosphatase and
protease inhibitors at a 1:2 (w/v) ratio. Lysate was clarified at 20,000 xg for 30 min and protein assayed.

Patient details are as follows:

DRG neurons were cultured in DMEM-based growth medium lacking anti-oxidants as described previously ( Brelstaff et al., 2015a ). Primary microglia were prepared from cortices of newborn C57 mice or
MFGE8 KO mice and expanded in medium containing 40% DMEM with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 60% L929 cell conditioned medium
( Sawada et al., 1990 ). BMDM cells were prepared from bone marrows of long limbs of
3–4 week-old mice ( Trouplin et al., 2013 ). BV2 cells were expanded from an
original stock obtained from ATCC. For co-culture, 200,000 BV2 cells or primary microglia or BMDM per culture (a ratio of
about 20:1) were added either directly to the medium or physically separated using a 0.4 mm pore transwell insert (Costar).
Co-cultures were maintained in DMEM, 1% PSF, 5% heat inactivated FBS, and 2 mM GlutaMax (GIBCO) for 4 days before
analysis.

For live labeling with AnnV, neurons were cultured for 7 days, washed, and labeled with 3 μM pFTAA and 0.1
mg/ml PI or DAPI ( Brelstaff et al., 2015a ). Medium was exchanged for HBSS containing
2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.5% (v/v) Alexa Fluor®−647-conjugated AnnV for 15 min at RT in the dark, then
returned to growth medium and imaged on a Leica DMI4000B microscope using a Leica DFC3000 G camera and the Leica application
suite 4.0.0.11706.

Following 4 h of incubation with LME (50 mM) in normal growth medium, LME was removed by 3 washes with PBS and
cultures were returned into growth medium overnight to ensure the death of the endogenous phagocytes. The next day, cultures
were stained with pFTAA, returned to growth medium and counted. The same fields of neurons were imaged over 14 days.

NAC or TEMPOL (5 mM final concentration) were added in growth medium for 2 days after which cells were washed and
labeled with AnnV-647. Arsenite (0.5 mM) was added for 15 min before washing and labeling with AnnV-647.

Dissociated DRG neurons were fixed either in 100% ethanol or 4% PFAfor 20 min and permeabilised in PBS containing 0.3%
triton x-100 (PBST). Antibodies were applied in PBST as described previously ( Brelstaff et
al., 2015a ). Fluorescent images were captured on a Leica DMI 4000B microscope as described above. Images were
analyzed using ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/,1997–2014 ). Confocal images were taken on a Leica SP8TCS microscope using LAS
X version 2.0.1.14392 software.

Fresh mouse brains were immediately fixed in 4% PFA for 24–48 h and sunk in PBS containing 30% sucrose. Coronal
sections (25 μm) were cut on a freezing microtome (Bright Instruments). Floating sections were permeablised in PBST and
stained in PBST with primary antibodies at 4°C, followed by the appropriate biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Staining was revealed using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit followed by the DAB kit (Vectorlabs). Sections were counter
stained in Cresyl Violet and mounted in DPX.

Cells were lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Equal protein amounts were loaded
in LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE, ThermoFisher) onto 4%−12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, and run with NuPAGE antioxidant
(ThermoFisher). After blotting onto 0.2 μm pore PVDF membranes (Merck), nonspecific background was blocked in 5% w/v
skimmed milk (Tesco) or 10% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4°C, followed by the appropriate HRP-labeled secondary antibody. Blots were developed with ECL Dura (GE Healthcare).
For the dot blot, FACS-sorted cells were pelleted and lysed in lysis buffer. DNA was digested by the addition of 50 mg/ml
DNase-I (Sigma) in 50 mM TrispH 8 with 10 mM MgCl 2 for 1 h at 37° C. Samples were incubated in 5% SDS in
dH 2 O for 10 min at room temperature and the entire mixture was filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane
under vacuum. Membranes were washed in 5% SDS under vacuum, blocked in 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 30 min, then incubated with
primary antibody (HT7) overnight at 4°C, and developed using the method described above. Asarkosyl-insoluble tau
preparation from a 5 m P301S-tau mouse brain ( Allen et al., 2002 ) and was used as a
positive control.

Live neurons pooled from three 5 m P301S-tau or C57 mice per sample were cultured for 7 DIV, labeled with 3 μ;M
pFTAAfor30 min at room temperature and washed. BV2 microglia were pre-labeled with IB4–594 for 15 min and washed before
addition to DRG neuron cultures. After 4 days, BV2 cells were mechanically dislodged from DRG co-cultures, strained through a
40 μm pore filter (BD Falcon), and sorted on a BD FACSAriaFusion Cell Sorter (Cambridge NIHR BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub).
Voltage range was set against unlabelled BV2 microglia and those singly labeled with IB4–594. Appropriate gates to
exclude doublets and cellular debris were set and single or double positive populations were collected.

Conditioned medium was deproteinised by centrifugation through a 10 KDa cutoff filter (Amicon UFC501024). NO was
measured using a colorimetric Griess NO kit (ab65328 Abcam). Absorbance (540 nm) was measured on an InfiniteM200Pro Tecan
plate reader.

Conditioned medium was concentrated through a 10 KDa cutoff filter and diluted back to its original volume with PBS.
MFGE8 was measured using a colorimetric ELISA kit (R&D MFGE80). Absorbance (at 450 nm) with wavelength correction at 540
nm was measured on the Tecan plate reader.

The MosaicIA - Interaction Analysis toolkit in ImageJ ( http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ ) was used to analyze the strength of interaction between neurons
and microglia in the facial nucleus. For proximity analysis, sections were imaged under a 10x objective. Sections were 25
μm thick and spaced 300 μm apart. The total number of sections from 3 mice each were: C57, 23; P301S-tau 23;
P301S x MFGE8 KO 19; MFGE8 KO 12.

Statistical analysis and graphing was performed using graph pad Prism version 7. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with a
Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple comparisons was applied where appropriate to analyze differences between the
cumulative frequencies of AnnV intensities. Five fields of neurons per coverslip were counted from the center of the coverslip to
its periphery in a blinded fashion by assigning each source of neurons a random file number. The distribution of
HT7/β-III-tubulin values for 5 m P301S-tau, 2 m P301S-tau and 5 m ALZ17 mice passed the normality test (D’Agostino
& Pearson, n = 21, K 2 = 3.305, p = 0.1915). The following numbers of neurons were counted: 5 m P301S DRG Naive,
2578; 5 m P301S DRG+BV2, 2431; 5 m P301S DRG+ BV2/transwell 2270; 2 m P301S DRG Naive, 2202; 2 m P301S DRG+BV2 1523; 2 m P301S
DRG+BV2/transwell 3524; 5 m ALz17 DRG Naive 1956; 5 m ALz17 DRG+BV2 1604; 5 m ALz17 DRG+BV2/transwell 2377; C57 DRG Naive 2099; 5
m C57 DRG+BV2 2236; 5 m C57 DRG+BV2/transwell 2010. All other samples were compared by Students t test, 1-way or 2-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by an appropriate post hoc test as indicated. Significant differences are reported as *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
