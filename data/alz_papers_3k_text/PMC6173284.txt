# Title
Structure of the membrane-assembled retromer coat by cryo-electron
tomography

# Abstract
Eukaryotic cells traffic proteins and lipids between different
compartments using protein-coated vesicles and tubules. The retromer complex is
required for generating cargo-selective tubulovesicular carriers from endosomal
membranes 1 – 3 . Conserved in eukaryotes, retromer
controls the cellular localisation and homeostasis of hundreds of transmembrane
proteins, and its disruption is associated with major neurodegenerative
disorders 4 – 7 . How retromer is assembled and how it is
recruited to form coated tubules is unknown. Here we describe the structure of
the retromer complex (Vps26-Vps29-Vps35) assembled on membrane tubules with the
sorting nexin (SNX) BAR protein Vps5, using cryo-electron tomography (cryoET)
and sub-tomogram averaging. This reveals a membrane-associated Vps5 array, from
which arches of retromer extend away from the membrane surface. Vps35 forms the
legs of these arches and Vps29 sits at the apex where it is free to interact
with regulatory factors. The bases of the arches connect to each other and to
Vps5 through Vps26. We observe the same arches on coated tubules within cells,
confirming their functional significance. Vps5 binds to Vps26 at a position
analogous to the previously described cargo and Snx3 binding site, implying the
existence of distinct retromer-sorting nexin assemblies. The structure provides
insights into the architecture of the coat and its mechanism of assembly, and
suggests that retromer promotes tubule formation by directing the distribution
of SNX proteins on the membrane surface while providing a scaffold for
regulatory protein interactions.

## Methods
All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain with induction by IPTG ( Extended Data Table 3 ). For purification of retromer complex, Vps29
and Vps35 proteins were co-expressed whereas Vps26 was expressed separately.
Cell pellets from both expressions were combined and lysed by high-pressure
homogenization in R-buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl). The homogenate
was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto an HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare)
resin cartridge followed by elution with 200 mM imidazole in R-buffer. The
eluate was loaded onto a Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) cartridge and
the retained protein was eluted by PreScission protease cleavage of the GST
domain. The eluted retromer, devoid of GST-tag, was further purified by gel
filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in
R-buffer with 1 mM TCEP ( Extended Data Fig.
1a ).

His-tagged Vps5 dimer was isolated using a HisTrap cartridge followed by
gel-filtration chromatography as above ( Extended
Data Fig. 1b, c ). To prepare retromer-Vps5 complex, the purified Vps5
was mixed with Vps35-Vps26-Vps29 complex, and the mixture was purified by gel
filtration on Superose 6, 10/300 (GE Healthcare) in R-buffer with 1mM TCEP.

GST-tagged Vps29 was expressed and purified essentially as above but
using thrombin (Sigma Aldrich) to cleave the linker between GST and Vps29, and
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl buffer instead of R-buffer. The cleaved
protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75
10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl.

C. thermophilum Vps29 is 201 amino acids in length and
thrombin cleavage leaves an additional two non-native N-terminal residues
(GlySer). Crystals of Vps29 were produced by hanging drop vapour diffusion using
protein at a concentration of 15 mg/ml. Crystals in spacegroup P2 1 grew from a reservoir solution of 8% PEG20000, 8% PEG550MME, 0.2 M calcium
acetate and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), and were cryoprotected in 25% glycerol.
Crystals were screened at the UQ ROCX diffraction facility on a Rigaku FR-E
Superbright generator with Osmic Vari-Max HF optics and Rigaku Saturn 944 CCD
detector. Data for structure determination was collected at the Australian
Synchrotron MX1 Beamline. Data was integrated with iMOSFLM 30 and scaled with SCALA 31 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement with
PHASER 32 using the human Vps29
protein 18 as an input model. The
resulting models were rebuilt with COOT 33 and refined with PHENIX 34 .
Crystallographic data and structure statistics are provided in Extended Data Table 2 .

Liposomes composed of POPC/POPE
(1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in 70:30 molar ratio, Avanti
Polar Lipids), Folch brain extract (Sigma) and Folch brain extract supplemented
with 3 mol% of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), (Echelon
Biosciences) were prepared at 1 mg/ml liposome solution in R-buffer by extrusion
through a 0.4 μm polycarbonate filter. For pelleting assays, liposomes at
a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and protein at a final concentration of 3
μM were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl, incubated at room
temperature for 15 min and then spun at 50,000 g for 30 min at 20ºC in a
Beckman TLA 100 rotor. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed by
Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE ( Extended Data Fig.
1e ). While the relative stoichiometry of retromer to Vps5 cannot be
reliably measured by Coomassie staining, we note that there appears to be a
reduced stoichiometry of retromer to Vps5 in the assembled structure. A
proportion of retromer may dissociate from the pre-assembled retromer-Vps5
complex as tubule formation proceeds.

For tubulation assays, 2.5 μM of proteins were incubated with
Folch liposomes (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h at room temperature in R-buffer ( Extended Data Fig. 1f ).

The retromer-Vps5 liposome tubulation reaction was mixed with 10 nm gold
fiducial markers in identical buffer solution. 3 μl of this mixture was
applied on a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (CF-2/1-3C, Protochips), blotted
from the back and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane (Leica EM GP automatic
plunger).

Imaging was performed on an FEI Titan Krios microscope fitted with Gatan
Quantum 967 LS and Gatan K2 Summit direct detector operated by Serial-EM
software 35 . 71 tomographic series
were acquired using a dose-symmetric scheme 36 with tilt range ± 60°, 3° angular increment
and defoci between -2.5 μm and -6.5 μm. The acquisition
magnification was 105,000x resulting in calibrated pixel size of 1.35 Å.
Tilt images were recorded as 10-frame movies in super-resolution mode at dose
rate ~1.8 e - /A 2 /s and a total dose per tomogram of
~131 e/A 2 . Super-resolution 8K frames were aligned, combined
and Fourier-cropped to 3838 × 3710 pixels using the
“alignframes” command from the IMOD package. Data collection
parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table
1 .

A small number of high-tilt images were discarded (e.g. those showing
significant movement or where other objects obscured the field of view).
Tilt-series were filtered according to the cumulative radiation dose 37 and aligned based on the gold fiducials
using the IMOD package 38 . CTF correction
was performed with “ctfphaseflip” IMOD command 39 using defocus values measured by
CTFFIND4 40 on non-dose-filtered
images. Tomograms were reconstructed from CTF-corrected, aligned stacks using
weighted back-projection in IMOD. Tomograms were further binned 2, 4 and 8 times
(hereafter called bin2, bin4 and bin8 tomograms) with anti-aliasing, resulting
in pixel sizes of 2.7 Å/px, 5.4 Å/px and 10.8 Å/px
respectively.

Subtomogram averaging was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks) functions
adapted from the TOM 41 , AV3 42 and Dynamo packages 43 essentially as described previously 44 . To define initial subtomogram positions, the central
axes of retromer tubules were manually traced in bin4 tomograms and tube radii
(measured from tube centre to the middle of the retromer layer) were recorded.
The tubular geometry was used to define coordinates and initial rotations of
overlapping sub-volumes along the tube surface. Rotations were defined to orient
sub-volumes normal to the membrane and with the in-plane angle perpendicular to
the main tubular axis; sub-volume spacing was 12 pixels (21.6 Å).

Reference-free subtomogram averaging (SA) was performed independently on
120 3 pixel subtomograms extracted from two bin4 tomograms
acquired at -2.5 μm and -5.5 μm defoci. A low-pass filter at 50
Å and a soft-edged cylindrical alignment mask were applied throughout.
The alignment in both tomograms converged in 5 iterations revealing prominent
two-fold symmetrical arch-like structures decorating the membrane layer ( Extended Data Fig. 2a ). These initial
structures were aligned, averaged ( Extended Data
Fig. 2b ) and rotated to place either the arch (“arch”
model) or the base between two neighbouring arches (“base” model)
in the centre of the reference ( Extended Data Fig.
2c ). The observed 2-fold symmetry was applied, and the reference was
low-pass filtered to 50 Å prior to using it as a starting reference for
alignment of the full dataset.

The full dataset was aligned against the “base” and
“arch” models in two identical but independent procedures. Initial
alignment was performed using 60 3 pixels subvolumes extracted from
bin8 tomograms applying a low-pass filter at 50 Å and 2-fold symmetry.
Upon alignment convergence ( Extended Data Fig.
2d ), where two or more subvolumes had converged to similar positions
(within 5 pixels distance), only the subvolume giving the highest
cross-correlation value to the reference was retained. Retained subvolumes were
divided into odd and even datasets, which were processed independently
hereafter.

Subsequent iterations of alignment and averaging were performed on
sub-volumes of 72 3 pixels extracted from bin4 tomograms, and then
subvolumes of 144 3 pixels from bin2 tomograms. The step-increment of
the angular search was gradually decreased and the low pass-filter was gradually
moved towards higher resolution (but set at least 3 Fourier pixels lower than
the frequency corresponding to 0.5 Fourier-shell correlation between the odd and
even datasets). A shell mask that follows the curvature of the membrane layer
was applied so that only retromer density was considered during alignment. A
population of sub-volumes with lowest cross-correlation (~40 %) were
removed by imposing a cross-correlation threshold selected manually for each
tomogram. The threshold was set to remove sub-volumes that were not aligned to
the membrane. The resolution for both “base” and
“arch” alignments reached ~13 Å upon convergence
(see maps in Extended Data Fig. 2e ).

Further alignments were performed using masks focussed on three
different regions of the arch structure (apex, leg and the membrane-associated
region below the apex, Extended Data Fig.
2f , panels 1, 2, and 3 respectively) and two different regions of the
base structure (immediately adjacent to, and slightly above, the membrane, Extended Data Fig. 2f , panels 4 and 5
respectively) to generate five maps ( Extended
Data Table 1 ). Two-fold symmetry was applied except for the alignment
focussed on the leg, where two subvolumes were extracted from each arch using
dynamo_subboxing_table (Dynamo), and symmetry was not applied.

Final converged averages were formed by 37,360 asymmetric units for
“arch”-derived and 32,074 asymmetric units for
“base”-derived maps. The measured overall resolutions for each
average ranged from 8.8 Å to 9.7 Å ( Extended Data Fig. 3a ). Local resolution maps are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3b . Final maps were
reweighted by division by their summed CTFs and sharpened by empirically
determined B factors of between 1300 and 1600.

Human Snx1 (4FSZ) is the deposited atomic model with highest sequence
similarity with C. thermophilum Vps5 BAR domain. However, the
Snx1 BAR dimer in 4FSZ is highly curved and cannot be docked into the Vps5 BAR
densities in our reconstruction. In contrast, the two deposited structures of
SNX-BAR domains, Snx9 (2RAJ) and Snx33 (4AKV), correspond well to the shape of
our experimentally-determined Vps5 densities. To allow Snx1 to be used as a
template for structural homology modelling, we adapted the curvature of the Snx1
to match that of Snx9. This was done by flexibly fitting the Snx1 BAR domain
into a density map simulated from the Snx9 structure using VMD and MDFF software
(within NAMD) 45 . Secondary structure
changes were prohibited throughout the simulation. The resulting
“curvature adjusted” Snx1 BAR model was then used to build a
homology model of the Vps5 BAR domain using the i-TASSER online service 46 . The Vps5 PX domain was modelled on the
Snx7 PX domain (3IQ2) with i-TASSER. A complete Vps5 PX-BAR dimer was modelled
by aligning the models of Vps5 PX and BAR domains to the Snx9 template as rigid
bodies using the match-maker tool in Chimera.

No structures of the full-length retromer complex are available. Two
partial homology models were generated using crystal structures of an N-terminal
fragment of human Vps35 bound to Vps26 (5F0J) and a C-terminal fragment of human
Vps35 bound to Vps29 (2R17). The Vps26-Vps35(N) complex and Vps29-Vps35(C)
complex include residues 14-470 and 476-780 respectively, together covering
nearly the entire human Vps35 sequence (796 residues in total). These two models
were used as templates for modelling C. thermophilum Vps26-Vps35(N) and Vps29-Vps35(C) respectively using the
“hetero-project” pipeline on the Swiss-Model web-server 47 . In the latter model the modelled Vps29
was then replaced by our X-ray structure of C. thermophilum Vps29 (1W8M).

UCSF Chimera 48 and ChimeraX 49 were used for rigid-body fitting and
visualization. The relative orientations of the locally aligned maps were
determined by sequential alignment of the maps using their overlapping regions
using the “fit” command preceded by rough manual placement. The
obtained composite was used to visualize the relative positions of structural
models built in individual locally-aligned maps and to transfer models between
the maps.

Vps26-Vps35(N), Vps29-Vps35(C) and Vps5 dimer homology models were fit
into locally aligned maps using the Chimera fit command with random initial
placement. Unique docking positions were identified displaying the highest
cross-correlation and coverage scores ( Extended
Data Fig. 5a-c ).

The results of rigid body fitting showed excellent correspondence with
the observed density. For Vps5 and the central region of Vps35, some small
differences in the positions of helices were observed between the fitted model
and the EM density. Vps5 and residues 122-816 of Vps35 were therefore flexibly
fit into the density maps with the highest local resolution using the MDFF
software within NAMD 45 , maintaining all
secondary structure. A long yeast-specific loop (305-387) and a long linker
between N- and C-portions of Vps35 (537-559) were excluded from the Vps35 model.
An unoccupied density (indicated by arrowhead in Extended Data Fig. 3b ) may correspond to the putative helical region
(340-370) in the 305-387 loop of Vps35.

We note that Vps5 dimers that contact Vps26 via their C-terminal helix
(“stabilised dimers”) are better resolved than dimers with free
C-termini ( Extended Data Fig. 3b ). In the
final model, the “stabilised” Vps5 dimer that was fit into the map
with highest local resolution was copied to all other positions where
“stabilised” dimers were present and was fitted locally as a rigid
body. For “unstabilised” Vps5 dimers, the fit into the map with
highest local resolution was copied to another equivalent position.

The arrangement of the retromer coat on individual tubules was
visualised by placing models of protein components of the coat at the
coordinates and rotations to which subtomograms converged during alignment (see
example in Fig. 3a ). Simplified models were
prepared by segmenting densities of interest from the corresponding
Gaussian-smoothed subtomogram averages using UCSF Chimera.

To assess the long-range order of the retromer coat, we determined the
relative orientation of neighbouring retromer subunits. To do this, we took the
positions and rotational orientations of all subtomograms in the final
alignment, and plotted the relative positions of all neighbouring subtomograms
(those within 416 Å). We performed this operation for subtomograms
aligned on Vps26 and for subtomograms aligned on the apex of the retromer arch.
In this way, the positions of 16037 and 18680 sets respectively of
distance-selected neighbours were plotted to generate a 3D density plot ( Extended Data Fig. 7a, b ). To simplify
visualisation, we flattened and projected the 3D density plot to give a 2D
density plot ( Extended Data Fig. 7c, d ).
The presence of peaks in the density plot shows that neighbours are found in
preferred relative positions. The membrane-associated layer of the coat
(represented by Vps26 dimers) shows more long-range order than the retromer
arches, likely due to relative structural flexibility in the arch (compare Extended Data Fig. 7c and d ).

Analysing the 3D density plot for Vps26 neighbours reveals six positions
at which the nearest-neighbour Vps26 is located. Subtomograms were divided into
groups according to whether a neighbour was identified in each of the six peaks
(numbered in Extended Data Fig. 7e ). Peaks
related by the two-fold symmetry of Vps26 are equivalent and were therefore
included in the same groups. Each of the six groups of subtomograms was then
separately averaged (at bin4) to generate six local density maps of the retromer
coat ( Extended Data Fig. 7g ). Each of the
structures therefore shows the conformation of retromer when a nearest-neighbour
is present in one of the six preferred positions ( Fig 3b ).

Models shown in Fig. 3a were
prepared by segmentation and low-pass filtering, their respective protein
structures are illustrated in the boxed panels. The models shown in Fig. 3b and c were built by fitting retromer
components into the six density maps for each relation ( Extended Data Fig. 7g ), and combining the fitted structures
in the relative arrangements observed in Fig.
3a .

In a previously described study, C. reinhardtii cells
were vitrified, and thin lamellae containing regions of the cell interior were
prepared by cryo-focused ion beam milling 50 , 51 before imaging by
cryo-electron tomography 26 , 52 . We reanalyzed these tomograms,
identifying 17 coated tubular membranes in 12 tomograms. The coat on these tubes
appeared distinct from previously observed COPI, COPII and clathrin coats. For 9
tubes, we could determine the morphology of the compartment they emanated from:
4 budded from multivesicular bodies, 4 from TGN compartments (rounded
translucent cisternae without luminal vesicles), and 1 from a lysosome-like
compartment. In tomographic slices of some of the tubes positioned perpendicular
to the XY plane, we observed that the coat was formed by arch-like densities. We
performed reference-free subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of the
coat, essentially as described in 26 ,
using a modified wedge mask that accounts for the amplitudes of the determined
CTF and applied exposure filters at each tilt 53 . We extracted subtomograms from binned tomograms (pixel size 1.36
nm) normal to the tube surface with a spacing of 8 pixels (11 nm) and box size
of 64 pixels. Subtomogram positions were randomized by 4 pixels along the tube
axis to avoid any artefacts from periodic picking. The initial average was
created and subtomograms were aligned to it with only z-axis shifts followed by
12 iterations of alignment with a soft cylindrical mask of 16 nm diameter and 37
nm height, with a lowpass filter set to 60 Å. The resulting average
displayed two arches. The centermost arch was shifted to the center of the box
and used as a reference for 4 additional iterations of alignment with two-fold
symmetry applied. Overlapping subtomograms were removed with the distance
threshold of 8 pixels (11 nm), the dataset was split in two halves from which
the averages were generated. The resolution was estimated using mask-corrected
FSC between these references, and was 37 Å at 0.5 cross-correlation,
extending significantly beyond the 60 Å lowpass filter used during
alignment.

molecular weight. Mean molecular weight and standard deviation from three
independent gel-filtration experiments are shown. The expected molecular
weight of Vps5 monomer is 67 kDa, so the observed molecular weight of 129
kDa indicates formation of a homodimer (c) . A Coomassie-stained
SDS-PAGE of Vps5 fractions from b . (d) Vps5 binds
to retromer in solution. SDS-PAGE of GST-Vps5 and of retromer are given in
the “input” panels. Retromer was incubated with GST-tagged
Vps5 or GST baits, and the resultant complex was isolated on Gluthathione
Sepharose beads (“pull-down” panels). The bottom panel shows
the intact PAGE gel used to extract lanes for the upper panel. (e) Retromer membrane recruitment is dependent on Vps5.
GST-Vps5 alone, GST-Vps5 with retromer complex, and retromer complex alone
were incubated with liposomes and pelleted to isolate the liposome-bound
protein fraction. Supernatant (S) and pelleted fraction (P) were compared
with Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE. PC/PE liposomes were used as a negative
control. Vps5 is efficiently pelleted by Folch brain extract liposomes, and
the introduction of PI3P does not increase the amount of pelleted protein.
The retromer complex shows no membrane association on its own, but is
recruited to Folch and Folch/PI3P membranes when it interacts with Vps5. (f) Retromer promotes tubule formation by Vps5.
Characteristic cryoEM images at medium (left) and high (right) magnification

presence of the retromer complex (bottom panels). Data shown in all panels
are representative of at least three independent experiments.

Stages in the subtomogram averaging procedure are shown from top to
bottom. Key steps are illustrated by average volumes (grey) overlaid with
the corresponding alignment mask (gold). Alignment masks are shown at 0.5
value threshold. Volumes in a-c are low-pass filtered to 50
Å. ( a ) The final iteration of reference-free subtomogram

These two volumes were used as starting references for further alignments.

two N-terminal β-sandwich domains. The positions of the docked Vps26
models suggest formation of an extended hydrophobic core between subunits.
Close-up images of fitted Vps26 subunits highlight the extended hydrophobic
core. (c) Surface representation of the Vps26-Vps35-Vps29
trimer mapped with binding regions for retromer effectors. Neighbouring Vps5
and retromer proteins in the assembled array are shown as ribbons. Retromer
components are coloured as in Fig. 1 .
Lower panels show higher magnification views of the overviews in the upper
panels. Binding sites observed in structural data are coloured according to
colour of the corresponding label; dashed lines indicate binding regions
identified in biochemical assays. The binding interfaces of human Snx27,
Snx3, Snx3/Dmt1-II, Varp/TBC1d5 were modelled using coordinates with PDB
accession numbers 4P2A, 5F0L and 5GTU respectively; the Dmt1-II cargo
peptide is shown as a ribbon. The Snx3/Dmt1-II binding site overlaps with
that of Vps5. The binding site of the Snx27 PDZ domain on Vps26 10 is accessible although due to a lack
of structural information on full-length Snx27 it is unclear whether this
binding is simultaneously consistent with membrane binding by the Snx27 PX
domains. The regulatory factors Varp and TBC1d5 share a binding interface on
Vps29 that is exposed towards the outer extremity of the coat. This site in
human Vps29 is also hijacked by the RidL protein from the pathogen Legionella pneumophila 54 , 55 . However, as for
Snx27, full-length structures of Varp, TBC1d5 and RidL are not available so
we cannot be sure how they will be arranged in the fully assembled array.
Rab7 has been speculated to contribute to membrane recruitment of retromer
by binding to Vps35 in the region indicated by the dashed line 56 , 57 . The deletion of this helical region (helix 6 in S.
cerevisiae ) resulted in loss of interaction with Ypt7 57 (the Rab7 homologue in yeast). It
has been shown recently that retromer binding to the PX-BAR complex
displaces Rab7 during formation of tubules 58 , 59 . The Vps10
“binding site” (dashed line) indicates a region where point
mutations affect Vps10 recycling 16 ,
however, no biochemical interactions between Vps10 and retromer have been
shown, and our efforts at detecting a physical interaction between Vps35 and
the cytosolic domains of Vps10 have not shown any direct binding. (d) Snx3 and Dmt1-II (transparent yellow and dark green
surfaces respectively), as bound to Vps35/Vps26 from PDB 5F0L 17 , overlayed with our retromer-Vps5

clash between Vps5 BAR and Snx3 PX domains. Note that C-terminal helix of
Vps5 BAR (arrowheads) clashes with the Dmt1-II cargo peptide density. Left
panel shows the same view as in the panel above in C; right panel shows the
model rotated by 90 degrees around the vertical axis to provide the view
along the long axis of BAR domain.

( a-c ) Fitting of structures to electron density maps
was performed from 10000 random initial placements of atomic models using
Chimera fit command. The cross-correlation between model and EM map, is
plotted against the fraction of the structural model within the EM density
threshold for: ( a ) Global fit of Vps5 dimer into the
membrane-associated BAR domain density under the arch (map f3

in Extended Data Fig. 2 ). ( c )
Global fit of Vps29/Vps35(C) into the apex of the arch (map f1
in Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Arrows indicate
the high-scoring rigid body fits which were used as starting points for
flexible fitting. ( d, e ) For a subset of ~50% of the
data we calculated tube centroids by spline fitting, and determined local
membrane curvature as the inverse of the distance from the subtomogram to
the tube centroid. (d) Slices through averages of 20% of the
subtomograms from the dataset with lowest (left) and highest (right)
membrane curvature, focused on the arch (top) or Vps26-dimer (bottom). See
also animation in Supplementary Video 5 . (e) Distribution of membrane
curvatures of retromer tubules in situ and in
vitro . Lumenal diameter of each tube were measured manually
from which mean and standard deviation were calculated.

(a) Overlay of the Vps5 heterodimer model after
flexible fitting into the cryoET structure (blue) with the human Snx9 PX-BAR
domains (beige; the bound PI3P headgroup is also shown in magenta in stick
representation). The PX and BAR domains in Vps5 adopt a very similar
architecture to the Snx9 protein, but there are variations in the angle
between the BAR domains, and in the orientations of the lateral PX domains.
The second and third α helices of the Vps5 BAR domain are also longer
than in Snx9. (b) Sequence alignment of Chaetomium
thermophilum (CtVps5, CtVps17) and human (hSnx1, hSnx5)

Sequence alignment and its representation were prepared in MultAlign 60 and ESPript 3.0 61 . (c) Overlay of ribbon models of CtVps5
(blue) and CtVps17 (grey). CtVps17 structure was modelled using CtVps5 as a
template (SWISS-MODEL).

frequent than other arrangements. Models of these relative arrangements are
shown in Fig. 3b, c . ( g )
Density maps are shown for the local retromer structure for each of the six
different relative Vps26 arrangements. Numbering corresponds to arrangements
shown in Fig. 3b . Maps are radially
coloured in grey, blue, green and gold for the membrane, Vps5, Vps26 and
Vps35/Vps29 layers respectively. (h) Overlay of density maps
for arrangements 2 and 3, and 2 and 4, showing that in some arrangements,
the Vps35 arch can tilt relative to the tubule to accommodate nearby arches.
The average of arrangement 2 is coloured as above, while arrangement 3 and 4
averages are coloured transparent grey.
