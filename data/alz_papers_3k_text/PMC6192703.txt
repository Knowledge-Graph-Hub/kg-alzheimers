Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β-sheets that assemble networks

# Abstract
Subcellular membrane-less assemblies are a reinvigorated area study in biology with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces we determined atomic structures of five segments of protein low-complexity domains associated with membrane-less assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β-sheets which pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic sidechains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, known to form networks and localize to membrane-less assemblies.

## Conclusion:
The prevalence of LCDs within eukaryotic proteomes has long been recognized ( 30 ), but the role of these domains has not been fully defined. Previous discoveries include: LCDs can “functionally aggregate” ( 31 ); proteins with LCDs typically form more protein-protein interactions ( 32 , 33 ) ; and proteins can interact homotypically and heterotypically through LC domains ( 1 , 5 , 34 ). Our atomic structures support the hypothesis that LC domains have the capacity to form gel-like networks. LARKS possess three properties that are consistent with their functioning as adhesive elements in protein gels formed from LC domains: i) High aqueous solubility contributed by their high proportion of hydrophilic residues: serine, glutamine, and asparagine; ii) Flexibility ensured by their high glycine content; iii) Multiple interaction motifs per chain ( Fig. 3B ), endowing them with multivalency, enabling them to entangle, forming networks as found in gels ( Fig. 2 ). That each LARKS provides adhesion only comparable to thermal energy suggests that numerous LARKS must cooperate in gel formation, and that the interactions must be concentration dependent and may be transient. If steric zippers act as molecular glue, then LARKS in LCDs act as Velcro. These properties are compatible with the hypothesis that LARKS are a protein interaction motif that provides adhesion of LCDs in protein gels and perhaps in membrane-less assemblies ( fig S10 ).
