The role of brain vasculature in neurodegenerative disorders

# Abstract
Adequate supply of blood and structural and functional integrity of blood vessels is key to normal brain functioning. On the other hand, cerebral blood flow (CBF) shortfalls and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction are early findings in neurodegenerative disorders in humans and animal models. Here, we first examine molecular definition of cerebral blood vessels, and pathways regulating CBF and BBB integrity. Then, we examine the role of CBF and BBB in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. We focus on AD as a platform of our analysis because more is known about neurovascular dysfunction in this disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we propose a hypothetical model of AD biomarkers to include brain vasculature as a factor contributing to the disease onset and progression, and suggest a common pathway linking brain vascular contributions to neurodegeneration in multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

## Introduction
Neurons work hard. To keep the 86 billion neurons in the human brain working properly requires an adequate supply of blood, which is accomplished through a vast, well-regulated vascular network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins reaching approximately 400 miles in length 1 , 2 . Several cell types work in concert to regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. This assortment of cells, collectively called the neurovascular unit (NVU), is comprised of endothelial cells forming the inner layer of the vessel walls, mural cells along the vessels that help regulate vascular tone (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells; SMCs), astrocytes whose endfeet cover most of the vasculature, and neurons 1 , 2 . The NVU cellular composition varies along the vascular tree, with rubber band-like SMCs wrapping vessels at the arterial and arteriole level, pericytes along capillaries, and “stellate” SMCs along venules 3 ( Figure 1a ).

A continuous endothelium monolayer forms the BBB, which maintains cerebrovascular integrity through continuous cross-talk between endothelium, mural cells, astrocytes and neurons. The BBB restricts paracellular and transcellular endothelial transport of most blood-derived macromolecules, blood cells (e.g., leukocytes) and microbial pathogens between blood and brain, and is present at all levels of the vascular tree from arteries and arterioles to capillaries to venules and veins 4 , 5 . The largest surface area of the BBB (> 85%) is provided by the capillary endothelium 6 . Numerous transport systems expressed mainly in brain capillary endothelium and venule endothelium 7 facilitate or actively shuttle molecules across BBB, as reviewed elsewhere 4 .

Here, we first examine molecular definition of cerebral blood vessels, cell types and zonation in the brain vasculature. Next, we review key pathways along the vascular tree regulating CBF and BBB integrity. Then, we discuss the role of CBF and BBB in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative changes in humans in different neurodegenerative disorders concentrating on recent neuroimaging data. We focus on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) because more is known about vascular dysfunction in this disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we propose an updated hypothetical model of AD biomarkers 8 to incorporate brain vascular changes as an important factor of the disease onset and progression, and suggest a common pathway linking brain vascular changes to neurodegeneration in multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

## Molecular definition of cerebral blood vessels
The concept of vascular ‘zonation’ landmarks was recently introduced based on single cell RNA-sequencing of brain vascular cell types isolated from different murine models suggesting molecular and functional phenotypic differences along the vasculature 7 ( Figure 1b ). Single endothelial cells isolated from Cldn5 -GFP reporter mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression driven by claudin-5, an endothelial tight junction protein, and transcriptional data allowed endothelial cell clustering into groups based on transcriptomic (dis)similarity. For example, arterial vascular zonation could be identified with arterial-specific endothelial markers, Bmx [encoding BMX non-receptor tyrosine kinase], Efnb2 [encoding ephrin B2], Vegfc [encoding vascular endothelial growth factor C], Sema3g [encoding semaphorin 3G], and Gkn3 [encoding gastrokine-3], and venous vascular zonation with venous-specific endothelial markers, Nr2f2 [encoding nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2] and Slc38a5 [encoding a sodium-dependent amino acid transporter] 7 . Analysis of the gradual arterial-to-venous (A-V) zonation reveals endothelial genes that peaked in the middle, representing the capillary enriched genes Mfsd2a [major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (MFSD2a)] and Tfrc [transferrin receptor] 7 . MFSD2a is an essential omega-3 fatty acid transporter 9 required for BBB formation and omega-3 fatty acid transport function 10 , and transferrin receptor is important for brain delivery of iron 4 . For the first time, this novel approach enables studies of transcriptional expression with respect to vascular zonation revealing molecular and functional differences along the brain vascular tree. For example, transcription factors predominated at the arterial endothelium, whereas transporters predominated at the capillary and venous endothelium. Some endothelial cells did not fit the A-V zonation pattern exhibiting high expression of ribosomal protein transcripts, which indicates that protein synthesis occurs throughout the A-V axis 7 .

In contrast to the endothelium with gradual zonation, mural cells exhibited a segregated zonation pattern. Isolated from Pdgfrb -GFP; Cspg4 -DsRed mice, mural cells transcriptionally separated into two distinct groups including pericytes and venous SMCs (vSMCs), and arterial and arteriolar SMCs (aSMCs) 7 . Clustering analysis revealed pericyte-enriched genes, Pdgfrβ [encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β], Cspg4 [encoding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)], Anpep [encoding N-aminopeptidase CD13], Rgs5 [encoding regulator of G protein signaling 5], Abcc9 [encoding SUR2 subunit of K + -ATP channel], Kcnj8 [encoding Kir6.1], Vtn [encoding vitronectin], and Ifitm1 [encoding interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1], consistent with reported literature 7 , 11 . aSMCs enriched genes included Acta2 [encoding alpha smooth muscle actin, α-SMA], Tagln [encoding transgelin], Myh11 [encoding myosin heavy chain 11], Myl9 [encoding myosin light chain 9], Mylk [encoding myosin light chain kinase], Sncg [encoding synuclein gamma], Cnn1 [encoding calponin-1], and Pln [encoding phospholamban] 7 ( Figure 1c ).

In contrast to aSMCs, pericytes express barely detectable levels of Acta2 encoding α-SMA 7 , a protein that plays a key role in cell contractile apparatus, which would argue against pericyte role in contractility and CBF regulation. However, using strategies that allow rapid filamentous-actin (F-actin) fixation or prevent F-actin depolymerization, it has been recently shown that pericytes on mouse retinal capillaries, including those in intermediate and deeper plexus, express α-SMA 12 . Junctional pericytes were more frequently α-SMA-positive compared to pericytes on linear capillary segments. Additionally, short interfering α-SMA-siRNA suppressed α-SMA expression preferentially in high order branch capillary pericytes, confirming the existence of a smaller pool of α-SMA in distal capillary pericytes that is quickly lost by depolymerization 12 . Recent RNA-seq studies also indicated that pericytes express moderate-to-robust levels of other contractile proteins including Des (desmin) and Cnn2 (calponin-2) 7 and Myl9 (myosin light chain 9) 11 . How and whether these contractile proteins contribute to the contractile apparatus in pericytes remains to be determined. Nevertheless, beyond expression of contractile proteins, more functional studies are needed to determine how exactly pericytes contribute to CBF regulation, as discussed in greater detail below.

## Pathways regulating CBF along the vascular tree
The NVU of the mammalian brain is functionally integrated to regulate CBF responses to neuronal stimulation in a process called neurovascular coupling or functional hyperemia 1 , 2 , which ensures a rapid increase in CBF and oxygen delivery to activated brain regions. Mural cells can depolarize and contract, or hyperpolarize and relax in response to different stimuli, to either constrict or dilate blood vessels, respectively, which in turn decreases or increases blood flow. SMCs regulate arteriolar and arterial vessel diameter 1 . Most in vivo rodent studies in the brain and retina, as well as studies using cortical and cerebellar slices and retinal explants suggest that pericytes regulate blood flow at the capillary level 13 – 20 . However, this has not been confirmed by some in vivo studies in the mouse cortex 21 , 22 , leaving this subject still as a matter of controversy. An exact explanation for these conflicting reports remains unclear at present, but could reflect technical challenges or underlying properties of the studied models that should be clarified by future studies. As pointed out in a recent review 1 , the evidence to date also does not rule out a role of capillaries (and pericytes) in the retrograde propagation of intramural vascular signals from capillary level upstream 1 , 23 , 24 . Given that the vast majority of brain vasculature is composed of capillaries (~90% in mouse cortex) 13 , 25 , capillaries and pericytes are well positioned to regulate CBF throughout the brain parenchyma. Figure 2 illustrates key cellular and molecular pathways regulating CBF.

Briefly, neurons signal the vasculature through transmitters adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine that act on their receptors - purinergic P2X and P2Y for ATP (also expressed on other CNS cell types 7 , 11 ) and adenosine A2A for adenosine - on SMCs and pericytes causing depolarization and cell contraction that reduces blood flow, or hyperpolarization and cell relaxation that increases blood flow, as shown in vivo in cortex and retina, and ex vivo in cortical slices and whole mount retina 2 , 13 , 26 . Noradrenaline contracts SMCs ex vivo in isolated retina and in vivo in cortical arterioles 23 and pericytes ex vivo in rat cerebellar slices and isolated retina 14 , whereas neuropeptide Y contracts cortical arterioles in vivo 27 . Neuronal nitric oxide (NO) can hyperpolarize and relax SMCs and pericytes increasing blood flow in vivo and ex vivo 2 , 15 , 20 . Although it has been initially suggested that NO can act by blocking 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) production, this mechanism may play a more significant role in autoregulation of vascular tone than neurovascular coupling 28 . In contrast, a recent study suggested that dilation of arterioles depends on NMDA receptor activation and Ca 2+ -dependent NO generation by interneurons, whereas the dilation of capillary pericytes in mouse cortex is mediated by local Ca 2+ elevations in glial processes and endfeet along capillaries 16 although regional differences may exist 15 – 17 , 20 , 29 . These findings indicate that different signaling cascades regulate CBF at the capillary and arteriole levels. Neuronal activity elevates extracellular potassium ([K + ]) directly and/or via release from astrocytes (as an effect of neuronal ATP stimulation, see below), which acts on various K + and Ca 2+ channels to alter pericyte and SMCs tone, leading to alterations in blood flow as shown in brain and retina in vivo 2 , 29 ( Figure 2 ).

Astrocytes also respond to neuronal ATP through P2X or P2Y receptors by increasing intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ]) (similar to microglia and oligodendrocytes 7 , 11 ), as shown in live and whole mount retina 26 , which triggers production of arachidonic acid (AA) and its vasoactive metabolites (20-HETE; prostaglandin E2, PGE2; and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, EETs) as shown in vivo in cortex and retina and ex vivo in cortical and cerebellar slices and retinal explants 2 , 15 , 16 , 29 , and secretion of K + . Mural cells generate 20-HETE from AA causing cell depolarization and blood flow reduction, while PGE2 hyperpolarizes SMCs and pericytes (via PGE2 receptor EP4, EP4R) increasing vessel diameter, as shown in vivo in cortex and retina and ex vivo in cortical and cerebellar slices and retinal explants 2 , 15 , 16 , 29 . The role of astrocytes in CBF regulation has been, however, a matter of controversy, stemming from conflicting data as to whether astrocyte [Ca 2+ ] can increase in response to stimulus, and whether if any [Ca 2+ ] increase can occur rapidly enough to influence neurovascular coupling 29 ( Figure 2 ). Additional studies are needed to resolve this controversy.

Endothelial cells respond to acetylcholine (ACh) from the blood stream via muscarinic ACh receptors 30 , 31 , and blood flow shear stress to generate NO 23 , which increases blood flow by relaxing pericytes and SMCs, as described above. ACh also causes NO-independent endothelial hyperpolarization 23 . Shear stress triggers production of AA and AA-derived metabolites (EETs; prostacyclin, PGI2), which act on SMCs to increase blood flow 23 . Extracellular [K + ] elevations can hyperpolarize endothelium at both the capillary and arteriole level, which can propagate in a retrograde direction via gap junctions shared between endothelial cells and endothelial-mural cell junctions, leading to relaxation and dilation of upstream vasculature to increase blood flow 1 , 2 , 23 . These endothelial pathways have been described ex vivo in various rodent aortic and brain arteriole ring preparations, and in vivo in cortex and cerebellum, but further validation studies in brain are needed.

Expression of all major receptors, ion channels and other key proteins in SMCs, pericytes, endothelial cells and astrocytes contributing to CBF regulation, as shown in Figure 2 , has been supported by recent single cell RNA-seq analysis of the brain vasculature in murine models 7 .

## Pathways regulating BBB integrity along the vascular tree
Formation and maintenance of the BBB is accomplished through expression of tight junctions (e.g., claudins, occludin, zona occludens) and adherens junctions (e.g., vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), connexins) connecting neighboring endothelial cells, as well as the paucity of trans-endothelial bulk flow transcytosis 4 . Gap junctions between endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes contribute to cerebrovascular integrity. Upholding endothelial barrier is essential for specialized transport properties and functions of BBB, as reviewed elsewhere 4 . Figure 3 summarizes key cellular and molecular pathways underlying BBB establishment and maintenance.

Studies using pericyte-deficient murine models with reduced endothelial-derived platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) bioavailability or deficient PDGF receptor-β (PDGFRβ) signaling in pericytes, have suggested that pericytes regulate BBB formation and maintenance at the level of brain capillaries 5 , 32 – 35 . PDGF-BB is a ligand for PDGFRβ on pericytes, which controls pericyte survival, proliferation, and migration 32 – 36 ( Figure 3 , left ). Endothelial-secreted Notch ligands signal via Notch3 receptor in pericytes to promote pericyte survival 5 . Similarly, pericyte-derived Notch ligands bind to endothelial Notch1 receptor, which promotes N-cadherin synthesis stabilizing BBB 5 . Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) signals VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in capillary endothelium reinforcing cell survival 5 . Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and TGFβ receptor-2 (TGFβR2) signaling between pericytes and endothelial cells regulates endothelial proliferation and differentiation and pericytes proliferation and migration 5 ( Figure 3 , left ).

Ephrin type B receptor 2 (EphB2) expressed by arterial endothelial cells regulates SMC recruitment to the developing vessels contributing to cerebrovascular integrity, which is indirectly indicative of BBB stability 4 , 37 . Loss of EphB2 disrupts mural cell coverage causing BBB breakdown 37 . Ablation of astrocytic laminin leads to BBB breakdown 38 . Apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoforms, secreted by astrocytes regulate BBB integrity by signaling the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) on pericytes 39 . Additionally, neuron-secreted Wnt, a ligand of frizzled (FZD) receptor on endothelium, promotes endothelial cell differentiation during brain vasculogenesis 40 , 41 .

Expression of all major receptors and key proteins in endothelial cells, pericytes, SMCs and astrocytes regulating BBB integrity, as shown in Figure 3 , has been supported by recent single cell RNA-seq analysis of the brain vasculature in murine models 7 . Besides contributing to BBB formation, these pathways continue to play an important role in BBB maintenance in the adult and aging brain.

## Gap between basic, translational and human studies of the brain vasculature
The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating CBF and BBB integrity, as discussed in the first half of this Review, have been extensively examined in animal models generating important basic physiological data. However, these mechanisms have not been studied in great detail in models of neurodegenerative diseases that show early neurovascular dysfunction 6 , nor in humans with early CBF and BBB deficits that are consistently observed in different neurodegenerative diseases 2 , 4 , 6 , 42 – 45 . Whether the pathways and molecular makeup of the human brain vasculature can reproduce findings in animal models remains unclear, illustrating a major gap between animal models and human studies. Nevertheless, knowledge from animal studies offers a roadmap to examine the link between neurovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration in humans.

Neurovascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized in AD 1 , 2 , 4 , 42 – 48 , besides classical pathological hallmarks of the disease including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss 8 . Neuropathological studies show that cerebrovascular pathology contributes to dementia and clinically diagnosed AD 46 and lowers the threshold for dementia due to AD 47 . Similarly, vascular risk factors also lower the threshold and act synergistically with Aβ burden to promote cognitive decline 49 . Neurovascular dysfunction is also seen as an early event in AD, influenced by genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors, as demonstrated by vascular biomarkers studies 42 , 44 , 45 , 50 , and discussed in sections to follow.

In addition to AD, the brain vasculature has been implicated in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative conditions such as HIV-induced neurocognitive disorder, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy 1 , 5 , 45 . Here, we focus on AD because more is known about neurovascular dysfunction in this disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders, but also discuss the emerging role of neurovascular dysfunction in PD, HD, ALS and MS. We concentrate on CBF and BBB neuroimaging biomarkers that have advanced the field in recent years establishing early role of brain vasculature in multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

## Cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer’s disease
CBF reductions, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity and impaired hemodynamic responses are increasingly recognized in early stages of AD and across normal aging-to-mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-AD spectrum ( Table 1 ). However, no evidence to date shows that CBF deficits are causal to AD. Below, we examine studies showing that CBF is a useful biomarker in preclinical AD.

Early studies found that individuals with greater CBF velocity, as shown by transcranial Doppler measurements in the middle cerebral artery, are less likely to develop dementia or hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy 51 . Similar, individuals with MCI or early AD develop early CBF reductions in the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, as shown by arterial spin labelling (ASL)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2 , 43 , 52 – 54 . Progression of MCI to AD is associated with more global 55 – 60 and severe, up to 40%, CBF reductions 61 , 62 , which includes other CNS regions besides the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, such as bilateral parietotemporal, frontal and occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex ( Table 1 ). Studies using two-dimensional phase contrast MRI confirmed CBF reductions in MCI 63 and full blown AD 64 .

A large cohort longitudinal study from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database suggested that changes in vascular biomarkers (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, cortisol, and apolipoprotein A that are all associated with cardiovascular disorders 42 ) and decreased CBF by 2D ASL occur before detectable changes in classical Aβ and tau CSF AD biomarkers 42 . Ideally, the CBF findings in this study 42 should be confirmed using more sensitive methods such as those that use contrast agents (e.g., dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), DCE perfusion) to achieve better signal to noise ratio compared to ASL, which is less optimal and noisy. Reduced CBF in parietotemporal cortex and basal ganglia in MCI was also shown to occur before brain atrophy by DSC-MRI studies 65 . ASL imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed widespread and Aβ-independent CBF reductions in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers with strongest genetic risk for AD 66 . [ 15 O]-labeled water-PET longitudinal study showed widespread decline of CBF occurs over time in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers 67 . More longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the relationship between CBF and Aβ and tau pathological changes.

Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, reflecting diminished vasodilation of cerebral vessels in response to a CO 2 inhalation challenge, was found early in AD compared to cognitively normal controls using transcranial Doppler 68 and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-functional MRI (fMRI) 69 . However, the evidence that this is etiologic is lacking, and while it is possible that these effects could also be downstream to Aβ-mediated vasculopathy, neither of these two studies investigated the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is characterized by deposition of Aβ in the wall of small and mid-sized cerebral and leptomeningeal arteries, veins and cerebral capillaries, and is related to AD 70 . Impaired cerebral blood vessels reactivity to CO 2 has also been shown in the hippocampus of young, non-demented APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers by BOLD-fMRI in response to a memory task 71 , and by reduced CBF velocity in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler 72 ( Table 1 ).

BOLD-fMRI provides a measure of neurovascular coupling by detecting an increase in blood oxygen delivery and CBF in response to neuronal stimulation 43 . The physiological basis of the BOLD signal has not been fully elucidated and current models include contributions from different hemodynamic and blood parameters 43 . Most fMRI studies treat the BOLD response as an indirect qualitative measure of neuronal activity and interpret BOLD signal differences as changes in neuronal activity. However, the BOLD signal reflects local changes in deoxyhemoglobin content, which in turn exhibits an intricate dependence on changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO 2 ). Factors that disturb the connection between CBF and CMRO 2 (e.g., altered cerebrovascular structure, reduced blood vessel elasticity, atherosclerosis, reduced resting state CBF, decreased resting CMRO 2 , reduced vascular reactivity to chemical modulators) may therefore significantly change the BOLD signal during aging and AD, even when neuronal activity is unchanged, which should be taken into account in data interpretation 43 . Reduced CBF response to visual stimuli and memory encoding tasks were detected in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex in MCI patients 73 , and in the hippocampus in AD patients 73 , 74 . Changes in the hemodynamic response in the visual cortex were also found in patients with CAA 75 that associate with cerebrovascular dysfunction 45 . The alterations in BOLD signal activity during AD progression appear to be regionally specific, and depend on the nature of cognitive tasks, indicating that they indeed may reflect the pathophysiological changes in neurovascular coupling ( Table 1 ). However, two important caveats have limited the application and interpretation of BOLD studies in AD including head motion artifacts and often limited ability of subjects with neurodegenerative diseases to perform tasks.

Most animal CBF studies have been done in transgenic AD APP models of Aβ amyloidosis. These studies have shown that Aβ has vasoactive and vasculotoxic effects on brain vessels, as recently reviewed 2 . Briefly, Aβ vasoactive effects were shown on cerebral blood vessels both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mouse models overexpressing human APP mutations 1 , 2 , including impaired CBF responses to vasodilators 76 , and dysfunctional neurovascular coupling 77 . Thus, preventing Aβ deposition may clearly abolish Aβ-dependent effects on CBF reductions and dysregulation. A recent study in APP mice expressing human Swedish, Dutch and Iowa mutations has demonstrated, however, that counteracting the harmful effects of Aβ after vascular depositions is not effective in reversing the neurovascular dysfunction owing to the mural cell damage that is caused by aging and massive Aβ deposition 78 .

Several studies reported that CBF dysregulation develops early in experimental models of mural cell or endothelial dysfunction, which can lead to neuronal dysfunction and loss, independent of Aβ, as recently reviewed 2 . For instance, pericyte-deficient mutant mice develop early CBF reductions in grey 33 and white 79 matter in the absence of Aβ pathology, and aberrant CBF responses in the presence of initially normal neuronal activity, endothelial vasodilation, and astrocyte coverage of the blood vessels 13 . Thus, CBF reductions and dysregulation in mouse models can develop independent of Aβ and precede neuronal dysfunction, similar as suggested by human studies ( Table 1 ). In humanized APOE4 transgenic mice, early CBF reductions precede neuronal dysfunction independently of Aβ 39 , 80 similar as in human APOE4 carriers, as discussed above.

## Blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer’s disease
In parallel to early CBF changes, BBB breakdown and dysfunction have been shown in early stages during AD pathophysiological progression ( Table 2 ). Below, we examine studies indicating that BBB is a useful biomarker in preclinical AD.

Blood-to-brain leakage of an intravenously administered gadolinium-based contrast agent, as measured with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and quantified with the Patlak analysis, has recently enabled detection of subtle, regional changes in BBB permeability during the normal aging-to-MCI-to-AD spectrum 43 , 44 . These studies have shown an increase in BBB permeability in the hippocampus and its CA1 and dentate gyrus subfields during normal aging 44 , which is further accelerated in individuals with MCI prior to brain atrophy or detectable changes in Aβ and tau CSF biomarkers 44 . Individuals with MCI and early AD develop, with disease progression, increased BBB permeability in other brain regions including cortex, deep gray matter and white matter, all prior to dementia 81 , 59 , 82 . During MCI, the increased BBB permeability correlated with pericyte injury, as measured via CSF PDGFRβ pericyte biomarker, further supporting the presence of early BBB breakdown and capillary damage 44 . Interestingly, vascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and coronary disease did not influence BBB permeability 59 , suggesting that BBB breakdown during preclinical and early AD is not related to concomitant vascular conditions, but is rather an early independent biomarker contributing to AD pathophysiology. Future longitudinal studies are needed to precisely define the role of BBB breakdown in cognitive impairment and loss of structural and functional connectivity during AD progression and elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which it promotes AD pathology.

Microbleeds caused by blood leakage into brain parenchyma from damaged blood vessels due to loss of BBB integrity can be visualized by T2*-MRI sequences as hyposignals reflecting perivascular accumulation of blood-derived hemosiderin deposits 43 . Several studies indicate appearance of microbleeds during normal aging 83 – 88 , which is further accelerated in individuals with MCI 83 – 85 , 89 , early AD 83 , 85 , 86 , 88 – 90 , and AD 85 . Microbleeds reflect cerebral small vessel disease, which is observed in approximately 50% of all dementia cases worldwide 48 , 91 , and is associated with worse cognitive performance 85 and white matter hyperintensities 87 , 88 . APOE4 status accelerates microbleed prevalence in a majority of studies 86 – 88 , but not all 84 . However, at present there is no evidence that microbleeds are etiologically important in causing the AD pathology of plaques and tangles, and/or that they cause AD.

Microbleed etiology and topography are related, with CAA causing lobar microbleeds in AD and hypertensive arteriopathy causing deep infratentorial microbleeds 91 . Hypertension positively associates with microbleed size and prevalence 85 , 87 particularly in infratentorial regions, whereas other vascular risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia do not associate with microbleeds 86 . Some studies indicate that microbleeds predominate in deep infratentorial regions during early preclinical AD and MCI stages 84 , 87 supporting the view that they may precede amyloid pathology, determined by no difference in CSF Aβ42 in MCI subjects with and without microbleeds 84 , but are later seen in lobar regions 85 , 86 , 88 , 90 reflecting CAA etiology during AD progression ( Table 2 ). CAA further contributes to BBB breakdown, infarcts, white matter changes, and cognitive impairment leading the detection of dementia earlier 92 . Of note, studies using different magnetic field strengths indicate that the 7T magnet has approximately 3 times greater ability to detect smaller microbleeds compared to 3T magnet 89 ; this has implications for future research to determine the true quantity and size of microbleeds that appear throughout the normal aging-MCI-AD spectrum.

Numerous 18 F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET studies show decreased glucose brain uptake in early stages of AD prior to amyloid and tau changes detected by amyloid-PET and/or Aβ42 and phosphorylated-tau CSF analysis, and/or brain atrophy 93 – 98 . Cognitively normal individuals with increased genetic risk for AD such as PSEN1 mutation carriers 99 , 100 and APOE4 carriers 96 or positive AD maternal history 94 also display decreased FDG brain uptake as an initial pathophysiological event. Longitudinal studies indicate that FDG brain uptake is further diminished in AD in individuals that converted into AD either from cognitively unimpaired stage or MCI 93 , 97 , 101 – 103 . These reductions in brain uptake of glucose in AD patients are thought to reflect pathological hypometabolism resulting from neurodegeneration 8 , 104 . However, there is evidence from animal models that brain uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) depends on the BBB glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1). In particular, deletion of a single Slc2a1 allele encoding GLUT1 at the BBB in mice diminishes 14 C-2DG brain uptake followed by BBB breakdown, CBF reductions and dysregulation, capillary rarefaction, and eventually neuronal dysfunction and loss 105 . In humans, a few kinetic FDG-PET studies demonstrated reductions in FDG BBB transport in AD 106 – 108 . These reductions in BBB transport may be explained by the fact that the reduced expression of GLUT1 was found in the brain capillaries of AD patients in post-mortem studies 109 – 112 ( Table 2 ). Thus, in our opinion reduced FDG-PET does not reflect only glucose neuronal hypometabolism but can also reflect reduced transport of glucose across the BBB. Future studies in animal models and humans using glucose, FDG and glucose analogs that track only BBB transport (e.g., 3-O-[ 11 C]-methyl glucose) 113 , and in addition to PET more sensitive analytical methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy should further explore brain glucose transport and metabolism in AD and the therapeutic potential of GLUT1 BBB transporter.

P-glycoprotein is an active efflux transporter expressed at the BBB luminal endothelium 4 . Laboratory studies indicate that Aβ is cleared from brain-to-blood via abluminal LRP1-dependent efflux followed by luminal P-glycoprotein transport 4 , 114 . Individuals with early AD develop widespread reductions in P-glycoprotein BBB function in the parieto-temporal, frontal, occipital and cingulate cortices, and hippocampus, as shown using PET with the radiolabeled P-glycoprotein substrate, 11 C-verapamil 115 , 116 . Diminished P-glycoprotein BBB function occurred independently of reduced CBF 115 and prior to brain atrophy 116 . In addition to P-glycoprotein, other BBB transporter changes including increased levels of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), a major Aβ influx transporter at the BBB, and decreased levels of LRP1, a major Aβ efflux transporter at the BBB, were found in cerebral blood vessels of AD patients 45 .

Consistent with human studies, studies in different models relevant to AD pathophysiology also indicate the presence of BBB breakdown and dysfunction. This topic has been comprehensively reviewed recently 6 , and will not be examined in great detail here. Briefly, animal studies using transgenic models with various mutations in human APP gene, have demonstrated perivascular accumulation of blood-derived proteins (e.g., fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G (IgG), albumin), vascular leakage of circulating exogenous tracers, loss of tight junction proteins, loss of pericyte coverage, pericyte and endothelial degeneration, and microbleeds, altogether indicating BBB breakdown 6 , 117 . Although most studies did not examine the time course of BBB changes in relation to other brain pathologies, those that did indicated that BBB breakdown occurs early prior to amyloid accumulation, behavioral deficits or brain degenerative changes 6 , 117 , 118 . Simultaneously, BBB transporter dysfunction occurs, including decreased luminal P-glycoprotein function, decreased LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance, increased RAGE-mediated Aβ influx, which all accelerates Aβ accumulation in APP models 114 , 119 – 121 . Decreased GLUT1 BBB expression also contributes to BBB breakdown and Aβ pathology by transcriptionally downregulating LRP1 105 , thus corroborating evidence from human BBB studies.

Different PSEN1 models (e.g., PSEN1 knockouts and PSEN1 mutations driven by neuronal promoters) exhibit microbleeds and endothelial degeneration indicative of BBB breakdown 122 , 123 , occurring prior to brain Aβ and CAA pathology 122 . AD models with tau mutations show also BBB leakage of exogenous tracers, IgG deposits, microbleeds, and leukocyte infiltration despite no evidence of brain Aβ or CAA accumulation 124 . Finally, APOE knockout mice and mice with targeted replacement of human APOE4 gene show BBB breakdown and dysfunction (e.g., loss of BBB GLUT1 and increased RAGE) 39 , 125 prior to development of behavioral deficits, synaptic changes and neuronal dysfunction 39 .

## Cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier in other neurodegenerative disorders
Early CBF and BBB changes are also found in other neurodegenerative disorders including PD, HD, MS and ALS ( Table 3 ).

Decreased CBF was found throughout the cortical mantles and precuneus in PD patients with a range of motor and cognitive impairments using ASL-MRI 126 . A recent study showed that CBF reductions were also detectable in non-demented patients with PD 127 , suggesting that perfusion abnormalities may be an early biomarker upstream of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Similarly, perfusion deficits were found in the cortex in early HD prior to cognitive dysfunction 128 . Using contrast MRI, early CBF reductions were detected in white matter lesions and in normally appearing white matter in relapsing-remitting MS patients with and without cognitive impairment 129 , 130 . ALS patients also develop early perfusion deficits in fronto-parietal cortex, subcortical grey matter as well as white matter in the absence of cognitive decline 131 , which is independent of brain atrophy 132 .

Global impaired vasodilation of cerebral vessels in response to CO 2 has been shown in PD using transcranial Doppler 133 and BOLD-fMRI 134 . Decreased cerebrovascular reactivity was also reported in MS 135 . Whether altered cerebrovascular reactivity occurs prior to motor and cognitive impairments remains, however, unknown.

DCE-MRI studies indicated increased regional BBB permeability (i.e., K trans values) in the basal ganglia in PD 136 , caudate nucleus in HD 137 , and white matter in MS 44 , 129 , 138 – 140 prior to cognitive decline 44 , 136 , 137 , 139 . Increased K trans BBB permeability values indicated perivascular lesion growth in MS with minimal motor symptoms 139 , suggesting loss of BBB integrity could be an early event driving MS pathophysiology.

Brain microbleeds are found in cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and internal and external capsules in PD 141 – 143 , as well as in deep layers of motor cortex in ALS 144 , occurring prior to cognitive decline 141 , 144 . However, it remains unclear whether microbleeds precede motor symptoms in PD and ALS. Moreover, the prevalence and regional distribution of microbleeds in HD and MS is presently unknown.

[ 11 C]-verapamil-PET scans indicated diminished P-glycoprotein efflux transport function at the BBB in the mid-brain in PD subjects with no cognitive impairment 145 . Whether or not P-glycoprotein or other BBB transporters play a role in HD, ALS, or MS, is currently elusive.

PET studies using a radiolabeled matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor ligand indicated increased MMP activity in MS lesions suggesting enhanced leukocyte infiltration across the BBB into the brain of cognitively normal MS patients 146 .

CBF and BBB dysfunctions have also been shown in animal models of PD, HD, ALS, and MS, as recently examined elsewhere 147 , 148 .

## Vascular pathways to neurodegeneration
The first hypothetical model of in vivo AD dynamic biomarkers, often called the Jack model , was proposed in 2010 and updated in 2013 to include interim evidence and present inter-subject variability in cognitive impairments 8 . This model was intended to summarize literature showing temporal evolution of in vivo AD biomarkers relative to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. This initial model, however, did not include currently available evidence that vascular dysfunction contributes to AD pathophysiology in a significant way 1 . Therefore, it is time now to update the hypothetical biomarkers model of AD and include the impact of cerebral blood vessels on AD pathophysiology, as previously suggested 42 , 149 . Figure 4 presents an updated revised model of AD biomarkers to show the role of brain vasculature and early changes in CBF and BBB biomarkers in AD that, according to some studies (see Table 1 and Table 2 ), are altered prior to cognitive decline, brain atrophy, neurodegeneration, and/or amyloid and tau biomarker abnormalities. The sigmoid shape of the vascular curve reflects growing evidence obtained from imaging, biofluid and post-mortem tissue studies indicating an initial acceleration followed by deceleration of brain vascular changes, which do not plateau, similar as shown for the other biomarkers. However, future longitudinal studies may warrant amendment of the proposed trajectories of the vascular curve as well as of the other biomarkers curves and/or their order of their respective appearance.

As discussed above, AD can be viewed as a model for other neurodegenerative diseases that are beginning to reveal notable vascular contributions to disease pathophysiology such as PD, HD, ALS and MS ( Table 3 ). Figure 5 illustrates the commonalities of vascular dysfunction across neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on specific regions where CBF shortfalls and BBB dysfunction are evident during early stages of each disease.

## Conclusions and future directions
An emerging role of brain vasculature in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, has led to increasingly recognized importance of healthy blood vessels for normal brain functioning. A recent single cell transcriptomics approach to examine vascular zonation along the A-V axis in mouse models is a huge conceptual advancement 7 , providing important insights to biological processes at different levels of the vascular tree and BBB. The single cell RNA-seq approach holds great promise to help us understand the cellular and molecular basis of CBF and BBB dysfunction in models of neurodegenerative disorders and AD, and by extension in humans with these disorders. While the molecular atlas of cerebral blood vessels and BBB is being elucidated in animal models, we lack the molecular definition of human brain vasculature, BBB, and perhaps NVU, to generate an atlas of blood vessels in the human brain during health and disease. Comparative knowledge of molecular makeup between humans and animals is essential to bridge this translational gap, and for future studies to take advantage of discoveries in animal models. This has the potential to reveal why regional changes in the brain vasculature may lead to disease-specific neurological phenotypes in different neurodegenerative diseases and inform gene networks and upstream regulators driving the link between cerebrovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

Neuroimaging holds the potential to further examine the regional vascular pathophysiology in the living human brain. Further advances are needed such as development of novel neuroimaging modalities for biomarkers of different vascular cell types including SMCs, pericytes and endothelial cells, markers of vascular zonation, and/or molecular pathways in blood vessels. For example, PET imaging with radiolabeled matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors examines in vivo leukocyte infiltration across the human BBB in multiple sclerosis, which can be applied to AD and other neurodegenerative disorders 45 . Similarly, MRI imaging of endothelial adhesion molecules detects the inflammatory phenotype of brain vascular endothelium in the rodent brain and models of different brain diseases 150 , which could be extended and developed for the living human brain. Similar types of probes could be developed to interrogate RAGE-mediated Aβ vascular influx, and/or LRP1-mediated Aβ vascular efflux capacity. Longitudinal studies with high field strength 7T (or greater) magnets will provide improved sensitivity to detect early, subtle, regional changes in cerebrovascular dysfunction, which will confirm or amend the temporal course of biomarkers abnormality in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The advances in imaging will continue to establish new early vascular biomarkers in the living human brain, hopefully revealing untapped novel targets of disease-modifying therapeutics for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.
