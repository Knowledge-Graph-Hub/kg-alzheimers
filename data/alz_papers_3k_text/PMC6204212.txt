Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold

# Abstract
The ordered assembly of tau protein into abnormal filamentous inclusions underlies many human neurodegenerative diseases 1 . Tau assemblies appear to spread through specific neural networks in each disease 2 , with short filaments having the greatest seeding activity 3 . The abundance of tau inclusions strongly correlates with disease symptoms 4 . Six tau isoforms are expressed in normal adult human brain - three isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats each (4R tau) and three isoforms lacking the second repeat (3R tau) 1 . In various diseases, tau filaments can be composed of either 3R tau or 4R tau, or of both 3R and 4R tau. They have distinct cellular and neuroanatomical distributions 5 , with morphological and biochemical differences suggesting that they may be able to adopt disease-specific molecular conformations 6 , 7 . Such conformers may give rise to different neuropathological phenotypes 8 , 9 , reminiscent of prion strains 10 . However, the underlying structures are not known. Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), we recently reported the structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease, which contain both 3R and 4R tau 11 . Here we have determined the structures of tau filaments from Pick’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by frontotemporal dementia. They consist of residues K 254 -F 378 of 3R tau, which are folded differently when compared to tau in Alzheimer’s disease filaments, establishing the existence of conformers of assembled tau. The Pick fold explains the selective incorporation of 3R tau in Pick bodies and the differences in phosphorylation relative to the tau filaments of Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings show how tau can adopt distinct folds in human brain in different diseases, an essential step for understanding the formation and propagation of molecular conformers.

## Methods
Sarkosyl-insoluble material was extracted from grey matter of frontal and temporal cortex of the patients’ brains, as described 33 . Approximately 6 g tissue was used for cryo-EM and 0.6 g tissue was used for immunolabelling. The pelleted sarkosyl-insoluble material was resuspended in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing 150mM NaCl and 0.02% amphipol A8–35 at 250 μl per g tissue, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30min at 4°C. The pellets, containing large contaminants, were discarded. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer at 15 μl per g tissue for cryo-EM and 150 μl per g tissue for immunolabelling. Pronase treatment was carried out as described for negative-stain EM 33 and cryo-EM 11 . Tau filaments were incubated with 0.4 mg/ml pronase (Sigma) for 5 min at 21°C before being deposited on EM grids and plunge-frozen.

Tau constructs lacking the BR136, Anti-4R, BR135 and TauC4 peptide sequences were cloned from pRK172 encoding wild-type 0N4R or 2N4R tau using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All recombinant tau proteins were expressed and purified as described [34] .

Western blotting and immunogold negative-stain EM were carried out as described 33 . For Western blotting, samples were resolved on 4–20% or 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex), and the primary antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA. BR136 is a polyclonal antibody that was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 244–257 of tau. The peptide (200 μg), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde, was mixed 1:1 with Freund’s complete adjuvant and used to immunise white Dutch rabbits. Booster injections using 200 μg of conjugated peptide mixed 1:1 with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant were given every 2 weeks for 10 weeks following the primary immunisation. Antibodies were harvested 7 days after the final booster injection and affinity purified. Extended Data Figure 6 shows that BR136 is specific for the C-terminal region of residues 244–257. Neurohistology and immunohistochemistry were carried out as described 35 . Brain sections were 8μm thick and were counterstained with haematoxylin. Detailed antibody information is provided in Extended Data Table 2 .

Whole exome sequencing was carried out at the Center for Medical Genomics of Indiana University School of Medicine using genomic DNA from the nine individuals with neuropathologically confirmed diagnoses of Pick’s disease, the tau filaments of which were used in Extended Data Figures 6 and 7 . Target enrichment was performed using the SureSelectXT human all exon library (V6, 58Mb, Agilent) and high-throughput sequencing using a HiSeq4000 (2×75bp paired-end configuration, Illumina). Bioinformatics analyses were performed as described 36 . Findings on MAPT , PSEN1 and APOE are presented in Extended Data Table 1 .

Seeded aggregation was carried out as described 37 , but with full-length wild-type tau protein and without the aggregation inducer heparin. Recombinant 0N3R and 0N4R tau were purified as described 34 . Extracted tau filaments (15 μl per g tissue) were diluted 1:10 in 10 mM HEPES pH7.4, 200 mM NaCl; 2 μl was added to 98 μl of 20 μM 0N3R or 0N4R recombinant tau in the same buffer with 10 μM thioflavin T in a black, clear bottom 96-well plate (Perkin Elmer). The plate was sealed and incubated at 37°C in a plate reader (BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega), with cycles of shaking for 60s (500 rpm, orbital) followed by no shaking for 60 s. Filament formation was monitored by measuring Thioflavin T fluorescence every 45 min using 450 −10 nm excitation and 480 −10 nm emission wavelengths, with an instrument gain of 1100. Three independent experiments were performed with separate recombinant protein preparations.

Extracted, pronase-treated tau filaments (3μl at a concentration of ~0.5mg/ml) were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Images were acquired on a Gatan K2-Summit detector in counting mode using an FEI Titan Krios at 300kV. A GIF-quantum energy filter (Gatan) was used with a slit width of 20eV to remove inelastically scattered electrons. Fifty-two movie frames were recorded, each with an exposure time of 250ms using a dose rate of 1.06 electrons per Å 2 per frame for a total accumulated dose of 55 electrons per Å 2 at a pixel size of 1.15Å on the specimen. Defocus values ranged from −1.7 to −2.8μm. Further details are presented in Exended Data Table 3 .

Movie frames were corrected for gain reference, motion-corrected and dose-weighted using MOTIONCOR2 38 . Aligned, non-dose-weighted micrographs were used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) in Gctf 39 . All subsequent image-processing steps were performed using helical reconstruction methods in RELION 2.1 22 , 40 . NPFs and WPFs were picked manually and processed as separate datasets.

NPF segments were extracted using a box size of 270 pixels and an inter-box distance of ~10% of the box size. Reference-free 2D classification was performed using a regularization value of T=2, and segments contributing to suboptimal 2D class averages were discarded. An initial helical twist of −0.73° was estimated from the crossover distances of NPFs in micrographs, and the helical rise was estimated to be 4.7 Å. Using these values, an initial 3D reference was reconstructed de novo from 2D class averages of segments comprising an entire helical cross-over. A first round of 3D classification, starting from the de novo initial model low-pass filtered to 40 Å, with local optimization of the helical twist and rise, and a regularization value of T=4 yielded a reconstruction in which individual β-sheets perpendicular to the helical axis were clearly separated, but no structure was discernable along the helical axis. Subsequently, 3D auto-refinement with optimization of helical twist and rise and a regularization value of T = 10 was performed using the segments that contributed to the 3D class displaying β-sheets. The resulting reconstruction showed clearly discernable β-strand separation.

An additional round of 3D classification with a regularization value of T = 10 starting from the 5 Å low-pass filtered map from the previous auto-refinement was used to further select segments for a final high-resolution refinement. In total, 16,097 segments contributed to the final map. The reconstruction obtained with this relatively small subset of the initial dataset matched lower-resolution reconstructions obtained with larger subsets of the data, indicating that image classification did not select for a specific structure from a conformationally heterogeneous dataset, but instead was successful in distinguishing the segments with high-resolution information from images of varying quality. This is in line with observations in single-particle analysis 41 . Superimposing the selected segments onto the original micrographs further confirmed this. Image classification also did not separate filaments with variable twists; instead, RELION combines segments from filaments with variable twists into a single 3D reconstruction and reduces the corresponding blurring effects by only using the central part of an intermediate asymmetrical reconstruction for real-space helical symmetrisation 22 . We used a 10% value for the corresponding helical z_percentage parameter.

Optimization of the helical twist and rise converged onto −0.75° and 4.78Å, respectively. Refinements with helical rises of multiples of 4.78Å all led to β-strand separation, but in agreement with the observed absence of layer lines between 50 and 4.7Å we were unable to detect any repeating patterns along the helical axis other than the successive rungs of β-strands.

The final NPF reconstruction was sharpened using standard post-processing procedures in RELION, resulting in a B-factor of −57Å 2 ( Extended Data Table 3 ). Helical symmetry was imposed on the post-processed map using RELION helix toolbox 22 . Final, overall resolution estimates were calculated from Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between the two independently refined half-maps, using phase-randomization to correct for convolution effects of a generous, soft-edged solvent mask 42 . The overall resolution estimate of the final map was 3.2 Å. Local resolution estimates were obtained using the same phase-randomization procedure, but with a soft spherical mask that was moved over the entire map.

The WPF dataset was down-scaled to a pixel size of 3.45 Å and segments were extracted using a box size of 180 pixels and an inter-box distance of ~10% of the box size. As with the NPF dataset, an initial 3D reference was reconstructed de novo from 2D class averages of segments comprising an entire helical cross-over. 3D classification was then performed to discard suboptimal segments. 3D auto-refinement of the best class with a regularization value of T = 4 and a fixed helical rise and twist of 4.7Å and −0.6°, respectively, led to a 3D structure with good separation of β-sheets perpendicular to the helical axis, but no structure was discernable along the helical axis. The cross-section of this map clearly revealed the presence of two NPF protofilaments. To further improve the reconstruction, we also made an initial model by placing two NPF maps, rotated 180° relative to each other in the WPF reconstruction, and low-pass filtering the resulting map to 60 Å. After a second 3D auto-refinement starting from this model, the final WPF reconstruction had an estimated overall resolution of 8Å and was sharpened by specifying a b-factor of −200 Å 2 ( Extended Data Table 3 ). In total, 3,003 segments contributed to the final map.

A single monomer of the NPF core was built de novo in the 3.2 Å resolution reconstruction using COOT 43 . Model building was started from the distinctive extended β-spiral conformation of the 332 PGGG 335 motif, neighbouring the large histidine side chains of residues 329 and 330, and working towards the N- and C-terminal regions by manually adding amino acids, followed by targeted real-space refinement. This assignment of amino acids was unambiguous due to the clear densities of the three PGGG motifs and the large aromatic side chains of Y310 and F346. The model was then translated to give a stack of three consecutive monomers to preserve nearest-neighbour interactions for the middle chain in subsequent refinements using a combination of real-space refinement in PHENIX 44 and Fourier-space refinement in REFMAC 45 . In the latter, local symmetry restraints were imposed to keep all β-strand rungs identical. Since most of the structure adopts a β-strand conformation, hydrogen-bond restraints were imposed to preserve a parallel, in-register hydrogen-bonding pattern in earlier stages of the model building process. Side-chain clashes were detected using MOLPROBITY 46 and corrected by iterative cycles of real-space refinement in COOT and Fourier-space refinement in REFMAC. The refined model of the NPF was rigid-body fitted into the WPF map. Separate NPF model refinements were performed against a single half-map, and the resulting model was compared to the other half-map to confirm the absence of overfitting. The final model was stable in refinements without additional restraints.
