Clearance of senescent glial cells preventstau-dependent pathology and cognitive decline

## Methods
MAPT P301S PS19 ( PS19 ) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock #008169) and bred to C57BL/6 for three generations. C57BL/6 ATTAC transgenic mice are as described 3 , 4 . Male PS19 mice were bred to ATTAC females to generate cohorts of ATTAC and PS19;ATTAC mice. All mice were on a pure C57BL/6 genetic background. Mice from this cohort were randomly assigned to receive AP20187 (AP; B/B homodimerizer; Clontech) or vehicle twice a week beginning at weaning age (3 weeks). Dosing of AP was 2.0 mg kg –1 body weight. 6-month-old short-term AP pulse treated animals ( Extended Data Fig. 6a ) received a dose of 10 mg kg –1 body weight for 5 consecutive days prior to tissue collection. Senolytic intervention was performed in C57BL/6 WT and PS19 animals. At weaning, mice were assigned to receive either ABT263 (Cayman, 923564–51-6) or vehicle (Phosal 50 PG, Lipoid NC0130871 – 60%; PEG400, Sigma 91893 – 30%, EtOH – 10%). ABT263 was administered by oral gavage at a dose of 50 mg kg –1 body on a repeating regiment of five consecutive days of treatment followed by 16 days of rest. Animals were housed in a 12h L/D cycle environment in pathogen-free barrier conditions as described in detail 3 . Compliance with relevant ethical regulations and all animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Prism software was used for all statistical analysis. A student’s two-tailed unpaired t- test with Welch’s correction was used in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 4b – e ; two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 10 ; and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used in all other figures. For consistency in these comparisons, the following denotes significance in all figures: * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. We note that no power calculations were used. Sample sizes are based on previously published experiments where differences were observed. No samples were excluded. Investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments and outcomes assessment, except for rare instances where blinding was not possible. All source data and exact P values (if applicable) for every figure are included in the supporting information that accompanies the paper.

Detection of X-Gal crystals by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining was performed as described 3 , 5 with the following alterations to accommodate central nervous tissue. Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; pH 7.4) until fluid runoff was clear. This was followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes at a rate of 3 ml per minute, and then ice-cold DPBS was perfused again for 2 minutes at the same rate to remove the remaining fixative. Brains were then isolated and the hippocampus and cortex were dissected out. A 1 mm x 1 mm piece from the CA1 and M1 region, respectively, was then incubated in SA-β-Gal staining solution (Cell Signaling) at 37 ° C for 6 h (hippocampus) or 18 h (cortex). The samples were placed in Trump’s fixative overnight at 4 ° C before being processed for routine transmission electron microscopy (dehydration by xylene-alcohol series, osmium tetroxide staining, and Epon resin embedding). Images were acquired and quantified using a Jeol 1400+ electron microscope with 80 kV acceleration voltage. Two grids from each tissue were produced, and >100 cells were scanned per grid at a magnification of 20,000x to detect X-Gal crystal containing cells. On average, half of all cells examined were neurons. Cells with one or more crystals and the total number of cells were counted. Cells containing crystals were imaged and independently assessed for distinguishing morphology. To define cell type, the following criteria were applied: 1) astrocytes – circular nucleus with spattered electron density pattern; 2) microglia – abnormally shaped nucleus with a much darker, often phagosome containing cytoplasm; and 3) neuron – large circular nucleus with less electron density and periodically denoted by an offshooting axon. Only cells with morphology consistent of astrocytes or microglia were clearly X-gal crystal positive.

Half brains were weighed and homogenized in 5X volume of Buffer I (50 mM Tris base [pH 7.4], 50mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM PMSF, 1X Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail [Thermo]). 250ul of the homogenate was then added to an equal volume of Buffer S (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1X Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail [Thermo]) and ultracentrifuged at 150,000g for 15 minutes at 4 ° C. The supernatant (S1-soluble protein fraction) was transferred to a new tube and the pellet homogenized in 3x volume of sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris [pH7.4], 0.8M NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF) before being ultracentrifuged at 150,000g for 15 minutes at 4 ° C. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant incubated with sarkosyl (Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate) at a final concentration of 1% for 1 hour at 37 ° C. Following incubation, the samples were ultracentrifuged at 150,000g for 30 minutes at 4 ° C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 25ul Buffer F (10 mM Tris [pH8.0], 1mM EDTA) to get the insoluble protein fraction (S2). Equal parts of 2x laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to each fraction (S1 and S2) and boiled at 100 ° C for 15 minutes to prepare the sarkosyl soluble and insoluble protein lysates. For total protein lysate, 90ul of the homogenate (half brain in 5X volume Buffer I) was added to 110ul of Buffer T (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris [pH7.4], 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 1 mM PMSF, X Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail [Thermo]). The samples were then sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 minutes at 4 ° C to remove debris. The supernatant was removed and added to equal parts 2x laemmli buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 ° C for 15 minutes to prepare the total protein lysate. Western blotting was performed as previously described 23 . Blots were probed with antibodies for total tau (ThermoFisher; MN1000, 1:5000) and phospho- tau S202/T205 (ThermoFisher; MN1020, 1:1000). Ponceau S staining was performed to normalize lysate loading for the total and S1 fraction lysates. Quantification was performed using ImageJ as described 3 .

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-qPCR analysis were performed on hippocampi and cortical samples from mouse brains as previously described 24 . Primers used to amplify Casp8, GFP, p16 Ink4a , p19 Arf , p21, Pai1, Il-6, Il-1b and Cd11b were as previously described 3 , 5 , 24 . The following additional primers were used: GFAP forward 5’-CCTTCTGACACGGATTTGGT-3’, reverse 5’-TAAGCTAGCCCTGGACATCG-3’ ; S100β forward 5’-CCGGAGTACTGGTGGAAGAC-3’, reverse 5’-GGACACTGAAGCCAGAGAGG-3’ ; Aqp4 forward 5’-TGAGCTCCACATCAGGACAG-3’, reverse 5’-TCCAGCTCGATCTTTTGGAC-3’; Cx3cr1 forward 5’-GTTCCAAAGGCCACAATGTC-3’, reverse 5’-TGAGTGACTGGCACTTCCTG-3’; Olig forward 5’-CCCCAGGGATGATCTAAGC-3’, reverse 5’-CAGAGCCAGGTTCTCCTCC-3’; NeFL forward 5’-AGGCCATCTTGACATTGAGG-3’, reverse 5’-GCAGAATGCAGACATTAGCG-3’; TBP forward 5’-GGCCTCTCAGAAGCATCACTA-3’, reverse 5’-GCCAAGCCCTGAGCATAA-3’. Expression for all experiments was normalized first to TBP .

Mice were transcardially perfused as described above. Brains were stored in 4% PFA overnight at 4 ° C and then cryoprotected by incubating in a 30% sucrose solution for 48 hours at 4 ° C. Samples were sectioned into 30 μM thick coronal sections and stored in antifreeze solution (300g Sucrose, 300 mL Ethylene Glycol, 500 mL PBS) at −20 ° C. Nissl staining (Bregma −2.1 to −2.4 mm), thioflavin S staining (Bregma −1.4 to −1.6 mm), and phospho- tau S202/S205 (ThermoFisher, MN1020; 1:500), phospho- tau T231 (ThermoFisher, MN1040; 1:500), phospho- tau S396 (Abcam, 109390; 1:500), and Gfap (Dako, Z0334; 1:500) and Iba1 (Novus, NB100–1028; 1:100) IHC staining (Bregma 1.6 to 1.0 mm and Lateral 2.0 to 2.7 mm) was performed on free-floating sections as described 25 – 27 . NeuN staining (EMD, MAB377; 1:200) of five sections (between Bregma −1.3 to −2.5) to measure dentate gyrus area was performed as previously described 28 . For cellular proliferation assays, animals were injected with EdU (Carbosynth, NE08701; 75mg/kg) intraperitoneally 24 hours prior to sacrifice. Imaging of EdU positive cells (Lateral 0.75 to 1.25 mm) was performed following manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen - Click-iT™ EdU Alexa Fluor™ 488 Imaging Kit, C10337). Iba1 (Wako, 019–19741; 1:500) immunofluorescent staining and Iba1/EdU colocalization assessments were performed as previously described 28 . TUNEL staining (Lateral 0.75 to 1.25 mm) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein: 11684795910). Thioflavin S, EdU/Iba1 colocalization, and in vivo TUNEL stained images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal system using multi-track configuration.

Dissociation of cerebral tissue was performed using the Adult Brain Dissociation kit from Miltenyi (MACS, 130–107-677) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were then incubated with a viability dye, LIVE/DEAD Aqua (Invitrogen, L34966; 1:250) followed by incubation with Cd11b eFluor 450 (eBioscience, 48–0112-80, 1:100), Cd45 APC eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 47–0451-82; 1:200), Glast1 PE (Miltenyi Biotec, 130–095-821; 1:100), O1 AF 700 (R&D Systems, FAB1327N-100UG; 1:100), and Cd56 APC (R&D Systems, FAB7820A; 1:100). These samples were then sorted using a FACSAria IIu SORP (BD Biosciences), with gating parameters created using FACSDiva 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences). A precise gating strategy was used to maximize the purification of each isolated cell population. Briefly, populations were isolated first by a negative report of the viability dye indicating the cell is viable ( Extended Data Figure 4 ), followed by a positive report of the desired marker, then negative reports of the other labels used. This strategy allowed for live cells containing only the desired marker to be sorted, while eliminating dead cells. Cells were sorted directly into lysis buffer and RNA was extracted with RNeasy Micro kits according to manufacturer’s instruction (Qiagen, cat #: 74004). cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR analysis were performed as described above.

Novel object recognition testing was performed as previously described 15 . Briefly, mice from each cohort were acclimated to a 50 cm x 50 cm testing environment for a period of two minutes. After acclimation, the mice were removed, the testing area was cleaned with 70% EtOH, and two identical scented candles were placed in either corner of the testing area approximately 5 cm from either wall. Mice were reintroduced, and the ratio of both the number of visits and time spent at each candle was recorded for a period of ten minutes. Recording was performed from above (Panasonic WV-CP294) and all video files were analyzed with TopScan Version 3.00 (Clever Sys Inc.). Afterwards, the mice were removed, the testing area cleaned with 70% EtOH, and one candle was replaced with a novel scent. The mice were reintroduced and the number of visits and total time per candle was recorded as before. Testing also was performed with visual stimuli by placing identical toy brick towers at either corner and then replacing with a different toy brick tower in the testing phase using the same experimental paradigm monitoring for the number of investigations.

Astrocyte and microglia primary cultures were prepared in tandem from mixed glial cultures as previously described 29 . C57BL/6 WT and ATTAC pups (p0-p3) were sacrificed, and the cerebellum was discarded. The remaining tissue had its meninges removed using forceps and a dissection scope. Cleaned cerebral tissue was placed in chilled Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution with HEPES (EBSH) (NaCl [120 mM], NaH 2 PO 4 [10 mM], KCl [2.5 mM], C 6 H 12 O 6 [20 mM], HEPES [20 mM], NaHCO 3 [10 mM], BSA [0.3%], H 2 O) until the remaining animals were sacrificed, and then animals were pooled together based on genotype (3–4 brains/group). The tissue was minced using a razor blade and dissociated by shaking in a 0.025% Trypsin/EBSH solution at 37°C for 30 minutes. FBS and MgSO 4 (3.82%)/ DNAse I (1mg/ml) were added, and the sample was placed on ice for 5 minutes to halt trypsinization. Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 200g at 25°C for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining pellet was resuspended in EBSH. Tissue was triturated using a 1 ml pipet to completely dissociate the sample and allowed to settle for 5 minutes to remove large debris. Samples were then transferred to clean tubes and underlayed with a 4% BSA/EBSH solution. The tissue was then centrifuged at 100g at 25°C for 8 minutes. Cells were counted using trypan blue and a hemocytometer and plated on a PDL-coated T75 dish (7–10 million cells/flask) with glial cell culture media (GCM) consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS, C 3 H 3 NaO 3 (1mM), Pen/Strep (500 ug/ml), and InvivoGen Primocin. Cultures were grown for 14 days (37°C ambient O 2 ) with media changes every 4 days. Microglia were isolated as previously described 30 using the EasySep Mouse CD11b Positive Selection Kit from Stem Cell (cat #: 18970). Microglia were collected and plated on 10-well glass slides (5,000 cells/well) and cultured for 6 days in GCM with LADMAC-conditioned media (20%, generously provided by the Howe Laboratory) before further experimentation. This conditioned media aids in the proliferation and maintenance of microglia cultures through the secretion of M-CSF by the LADMAC cells 31 . Microglia were allowed to proliferate for 6 days prior to experimentation. The mixed glial culture flow-through from the EasySep CD11b kit was replated in GCM on a PDL-coated T75 dish (10 million cells/flask). These cultures then underwent purification for astrocytes as previously described 29 . After 48 hours, flasks were placed on an orbital shaker and agitated at 200 rpm for two 24-hour periods with media refreshed once during and after the shaking. Flasks were then exposed to GCM containing liposomal clodronate (Clodrosome, 8909; 100 µg/ml) for 72 hours to remove any remaining microglia from the culture. The liposomal clodronate media was then removed and culture plates washed prior to further experimentation.

Microglia samples were exposed to media containing IFNy (R&D Systems, 285-IF; 200ng/ml), LPS (Sigma, L2654; 100ng/ml) or a combination of both for a period of 24 hours to induce an inflammatory response 32 . Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence to determine inflammation state as previously described 33 . Anti-Cd11b antibody (BioRad, MCA711G; 1:500) and goat-anti-rat AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen, A-11007; 1:500) staining was counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306; 1:1000). To assess AP-mediated cell clearance specificity, activated or basal microglia were exposed to AP20187 (Clontech, 635059; 10nM or 100nM) for a period of 24 hours. TUNEL staining was then performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein: 11684795910). All imaging was performed using an Olympus BX53 Fluorescence microscope and DP80 digital camera. Analysis was performed using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (version 1.51n) 34 . To obtain a TUNEL positive percentage, a region of interest was defined using Li Auto Thresholding of the DAPI channel, and the colocalization percentage was calculated using the colocalization threshold plugin bound by that region.

To track basal and activated astrocytic response to AP, astrocytes were plated in a 48 well culture plate (10,000 cells/well) and placed into the IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. The IncuCyte System is a time-lapse imaging system that records cell culture changes through photographic capture of the culture well within the incubator. Cultures were acclimated to the system for a period of 6 hours, then exposed to media containing IFNy (R&D Systems, 285-IF; 200ng/ml), LPS (Sigma, L2654; 100ng/ml) or a combination of both for a period of 24 hours to induce an inflammatory response 35 . Cells were also plated on 10-well slides and processed in tandem for immunofluorescence staining to verify activation status with anti- Gfap (DAKO, Z0334; 1:500) and counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306; 1:1000). After activation, astrocytes were exposed to AP20187 (Clontech, 635059; 10nM or 100nM) for a period of 24 hours. The IncuCyte captured phase images of each culture well were taken every 30 minutes over this period using the following settings: (Segmentation Adjustment: 0.8, Hole Fill: 450, Adjust size (pixels): −1, Minimum area (uM 2 ): 0.1). Phase confluency difference was calculated by subtracting the final phase confluency of each image from its initial value.
