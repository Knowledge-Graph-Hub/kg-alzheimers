Inhibiting Amyloid-ß cytotoxicity through its interaction with the cell surface receptor LilrB2 by structure-based design

# Abstract
Inhibiting the interaction between ß-amyloid (Aß) and a neuronal cell surface receptor, LilrB2, has been suggested as a potential route for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Supporting this approach, AD-like symptoms are reduced in mouse models following genetic depletion of the LilrB2 homolog. In its pathogenic, oligomeric state, Aß binds to LilrB2, triggering a pathway to synaptic loss. Here we identified the LilrB2 binding moieties of Aß ( 16 KLVFFA 21 ) and identified its binding site on LilrB2 from a crystal structure of LilrB2 immunoglobulin domains D1D2 complexed to small molecules that mimic phenylalanine residues. In this structure, we observed two pockets that can accommodate the phenylalanine sidechains of KLVFFA. These pockets were confirmed to be 16 KLVFFA 21 binding sites by mutagenesis. Rosetta docking revealed a plausible geometry for the Aß-LilrB2 complex and assisted with the structure-guided selection of small molecule inhibitors. These molecules inhibit Aß-LilrB2 interactions in vitro and on the cell surface and reduce Aß cytotoxicity, which suggests these inhibitors are potential therapeutic leads against AD.

## INTRODUCTION
Aggregated ß-amyloid (Aß) is found in large amounts in the autopsied brains of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients, and it is widely considered as a key factor in triggering neural degeneration in AD 1 , 2 . The longstanding amyloid cascade hypothesis has been challenged in recent years by the lack of correlation between Aß accumulation and cognitive impairment in elderly patients and the better correlation between histopathological changes of neurofibrillary tangles (aggregation of tau) and loss of cognition 3 – 5 . However, three major findings continue to support the hypothesis: Aß overproduction is found in nearly all familial forms of AD 6 , 7 , the oligomeric form of Aß is toxic to neurons 8 – 10 , and overexpression of Aß and APP (amyloid precursor protein) mutants in animal models leads to the development of AD related phenotypes 11 , 12 . Recent AD related studies continue to support the key role of Aß 13 , 14 .

Extensive work has focused on developing inhibitors of Aß toxicity as potential therapeutic drugs for AD. Most of these target Aß aggregation (e.g. 15 – 17 ), reduce the production of Aß through inhibition of ß or γ-secretase (e.g. 18 – 20 ), or reduce Aß levels through immunotherapy 21 (e.g. 22 ). Recent studies suggest that one or more high-affinity protein receptors on the neuronal cell surface, such as cellular prion protein (PrP C 23 ) and ephrin type B receptor 2 (EphB2 24 ), are responsible for the recruitment of Aß oligomers and subsequent neurotoxicity 25 . These findings have sparked interest in illuminating the molecular mechanism of Aß-receptor recognition, with the hope that this information will lead to the development of new, effective AD therapeutics that inhibit the interaction of Aß with neuron cell receptors.

Among all these cell surface Aß receptors 25 , LilrB2 is one of a few receptors that are reported to be promising therapeutic targets for treatment of AD, based on the observation that genetic depletion of the murine homolog, PirB (PirB −/− ), rescues Aß induced AD-related phenotypes in multiple model systems from cultured cortical neurons to transgenic mice, including recognition memory defects in APP/PS1 mice 26 . The two amino-terminal extracellular immunoglobulin domains (D1D2) of LilrB2 and its murine homolog PirB selectively bind Aß oligomers with nanomolar affinity. LilrB2 protein is detected in human brains of both AD patients and non-AD adults, with no significant difference in expression level, but its downstream signaling is altered in AD brains, implicating LilrB2 in Aß-dependent synaptic loss 26 . Here we identify the binding moieties of both Aß oligomers and LilrB2 and present a model for their interaction. Based on the structural model, we designed Aß-LilrB2 interaction inhibitors by computationally selecting molecules to compete with Aß for the LilrB2 binding sites. The resulting compounds inhibited the interaction between oligomeric Aß and LilrB2 with up to high nanomolar K i and low micromolar IC 50 values. They also showed the ability to inhibit LilrB2 induced Aß-cell contact, and therefore to inhibit Aß cytotoxicity.

## RESULTS
A 200-residue recombinant LilrB2 segment spanning the D1 and D2 domains (LilrB2 D1D2) was used in our study, and oligomeric human Aß 1–42 (Aß42) was prepared by incubating 10 μM Aß42 at 37 °C overnight ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). LilrB2 D1D2 selectively binds oligomeric Aß42 as previously reported 26 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). To map the binding core of Aß, we developed an ELISA-based interaction assay that enables high-throughput detection of the Aß-LilrB2 interaction. We immobilized LilrB2 D1D2 on an ELISA plate and measured the amount of bound Aß segments by Aß specific antibodies or the fluorescence signal of fluorescein conjugated to the segments. We found the LilrB2 D1D2 domains bind to Aß42 and its amino-terminal moiety Aß 1–21 , but not to Aß 1–15 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). We also found that the LilrB2 D1D2 domains bind to Aß 15–35 but not Aß 22–42 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results indicate that the Aß segment 16 KLVFFA 21 , which is also widely considered as a key element of Aß aggregation 27 , 28 , is the core region that binds to LilrB2 D1D2.

We then tested the interaction of LilrB2 D1D2 with 16 KLVFFA 21 derived peptides. We did not detect binding of LilrB2 D1D2 to the peptide that contains a single copy of 16 KLVFFA 21 (Aß 16–21 , Fig. 1 ). However, our experiment showed it did bind to a tandem repeat design of 16 KLVFFA 21 (Aß 16–21 -TR, sequence KLVFFAPDGKLVFFA, Fig. 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ). The binding we observed with the tandem repeats was not due to introduction of the Pro-Asp-Gly linker between the two 16 KLVFFA 21 copies, since the control peptide with a single copy of 16 KLVFFA 21 and the linker (Aß 16–21 -C, sequence KLVFFAPDG) did not bind to LilrB2 D1D2 ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggest that two copies of 16 KLVFFA 21 represent a minimal Aß oligomer and the core epitope for LilrB2 binding. Moreover, the observation that the tandem repeat but not the single copy of 16 KLVFFA 21 binds to LilrB2 suggests that LilrB2 recognizes a particular conformation in addition to the primary amino acid sequence. We hypothesize that the antiparallel dimer of 16 KLVFFA 21 , rather than a single copy, readily assembles into a minimal oligomer, reasoning that the tandem linkage lowers the entropy barrier to oligomer formation (see discussion).

We mixed LilrB2 D1D2 with various Aß segments and screened for crystals, and we determined the crystal structure of LilrB2 D1D2 mixed with Aß 14–23 at 2.1 Å resolution ( Supplementary Table 2 ). In this structure, no density for the Aß segment was found, which is consistent with no detectable binding of 16 KLVFFA 21 monomer to LilrB2 D1D2. Instead we found four benzamidine (Ben) molecules ( Fig. 2a ) which were used as an additive for crystal optimization. The presence and positions of the benzamidine molecules were determined by inspection of difference electron density maps (F o -F c , Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and the surrounding environment ( Fig. 2b and c ). The chemical structure of benzamidine is similar to that of phenylalanine ( Fig. 2a ), so it mimics the binding of phenylalanine from the 16 KLVFFA 21 binding core of Aß. We chose the binding pockets of Ben 3 and 4 for further investigation because of the following observations: First, the binding pockets of Ben 3 and 4 are close to each other (separated by 7.5 Å) and are both located in the groove between D1 and D2 domains ( Fig. 2a ). Given that at least two copies of 16 KLVFFA 21 are required to bind to LilrB2 ( Fig. 1 ) and each copy has two phenylalanines, it is likely that the binding sites for 16 KLVFFA 21 on LilrB2 have two phenylalanine binding pockets close to each other. Second, most residues comprising the Ben 3 and 4 binding pockets are hydrophobic with geometry suitable for binding bulky hydrophobic residues such as phenylalanine (Ile 154 , Tyr 199 , Pro 204 , Tyr 205 and Trp 207 for Ben 3 and Val 38 , Cys 156 , Pro 164 , Cys 166 and Trp 207 for Ben 4) ( Fig. 2a, b and c ). Hydrogen bonding (Ben 3 with Gly 51 and Asn 168 ; Ben 4 with Asp 36 ) and crystal lattice contacts (Ben 3 with Gly 51 and Ben 4 with Leu 53 ) also stabilize benzamidine binding, but are minor contributors and appear unnecessary for binding phenylalanine. Third, Asp 36 and other negatively charged residues are located adjacent to the groove ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), close enough to neutralize the positive charge of Lys 16 of 16 KLVFFA 21 and further stabilize its binding. Fourth, by superimposing our complex on the ligand free LilrB2 D1D2 structure (PDB ID 2GW5 29 ), we found that upon ligand binding, the binding groove widens due to movement of ß-strand of residues 165 to 168. In addition, the loop composed of residues 159 to 164, which is disordered and lacking electron density in the ligand-free structure, becomes ordered and forms a protective cap over the binding groove ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). These slight conformational changes make this groove a better binding site for both benzamidine and presumably the Aß binding core. On the basis of this structural analysis, we hypothesized that the binding pockets of Ben 3 and 4 on LilrB2 are the binding sites for 16 KLVFFA 21 of Aß; in the following we provide support for this hypothesis by mutagenesis and Rosetta docking.

We designed three LilrB2 mutations to validate the putative binding sites for Aß. We first chose Asn 168 and Val 38 , whose side chains participate in the Ben 3 and 4 pockets respectively ( Fig. 2b & c ). We mutated both to tryptophan to block these two pockets by creating steric hindrance with the ligands ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). We also designed the D36G mutation to target Asp 36 that putatively neutralizes the negative charge of Lys 16 of Aß. The three resulting mutant proteins, LilrB2 D1D2 D36G, V38W and N168W, bound significantly lower amounts of full length Aß as well as the 16 KLVFFA 21 tandem repeat (Aß 16–21 -TR) compared to wildtype at the same loading concentration in ELISA-based interaction assays ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Size exclusion chromatography shows that all three mutants elute at the same retention volume as wild type ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), and 1 H- 15 N-HSQC spectra show that these mutants have similar chemical shift patterns as wildtype ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), which indicates that diminished strength of these interactions is not due to changes in overall folding or the aggregation state of LilrB2. These results indicate that blocking Ben 3 and 4 binding pockets by single mutations diminishes the binding of LilrB2 for both full length Aß and the 16 KLVFFA 21 tandem repeat. Therefore, these results support our hypothesis that Ben 3 and 4 binding pockets are the binding sites for 16 KLVFFA 21 in the tandem repeat and in full length Aß.

To further validate the binding sites on LilrB2 and to develop a model of Aß-LilrB2 interaction, we applied Rosetta flexible peptide docking 30 to dock the 16 KLVFFA 21 segment to LilrB2 D1D2. We used our crystal structure shown in Fig. 2 as a starting model of LilrB2. An antiparallel ß-sheet unit was taken from the crystal structure of the 16 KLVFFA 21 steric zipper (PDB ID 3OW9 28 ), in order to represent a minimal ß-sheet conformation of oligomeric Aß 31 , and the tandem repeat of Aß 16–21 -TR (see discussion). During docking simulations, we confined KLVFFA to contact three key residues (Asp 36 , Val 38 , Asn 168 ) that we identified as important for Aβ binding in our mutagenesis experiments. To minimize the influence of the starting orientation of the peptide, we placed two strands of KLVFFA away from the groove between the D1 and D2 domains (putative binding site) in a random orientation. Notably, we imposed no restraints to occupy the putative binding pockets identified in our crystal structure with benzamidine. For each starting conformation, 50,000 models were generated and the top 500 models with favorable Rosetta energies were further refined by energy optimization. After refinement, the five models ranked by Rosetta energies 32 and shape complementary 33 were selected for visual inspection. We found one model with two phenylalanine residues located within the binding pockets of Ben 3 and 4 ( Fig. 3b to d). In this model, two independent KLVFFA molecules associated as an anti-parallel ß-sheet and docked in the groove between D1 and D2. Phe 20 and Phe 19 from separate molecules docked in the pockets of Ben 3 and 4, respectively. The RMSD of the aromatic rings between phenylalanine residues and benzamidine molecules are 2.3 Å. These docking results support our prediction of LilrB2 binding sites and provide a putative model of Aß-LilrB2 interaction. No other plausible Aß conformation was generated by our computational docking that fits two phenylalanines in these putative LilrB2 binding sites.

We designed Aß-LilrB2 interaction inhibitors (ALI) to occupy the binding sites on LilrB2 and prevent Aß binding, as directed by our structural model of the Aß-LilrB2 complex. Our approach, adapted from previous work 34 , combines knowledge of amyloid structures and computational screening to discover small molecules that interact with Aß fibrils and protect cells against their toxicity. We searched a compound library of ~32,000 small molecules, including approved drugs, drugs in animal tests and clinical trials, and natural products whose pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or toxicity profile is known ( Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary method ). Small molecules that can potentially mimic the conformation of the aromatic rings of the ligand in our crystal structure were selected and docked to the binding pocket of LilrB2. The compounds were then ranked by their predicted binding energy and the similarity between the docked model and the crystal structure. Finally, 12 top-ranking small molecules (ALI 1–12) were chosen for experimental characterization based on their shape similarity, computational docking energy, and potential to cross the blood-brain barrier ( Supplementary Table 3 ).

We tested the inhibitory efficiency of all candidates by quantitative immunoprecipitation assays with LilrB2 D1D2 and oligomeric Aß42. At a molar ratio of 1:10:50 (LilrB2:Aß:inhibitor), 9 out of 12 candidates show inhibition of Aß-LilrB2 interaction with a lower Aß binding signal that considered to be statistically significant compared to the controls with no inhibitor added ( Fig. 4a ). Six candidates (ALI4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10) were selected for concentration dependent studies, and all of them inhibited Aß-LilrB2 interaction in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Their docking models created by high resolution Rosetta docking are superimposed with benzamidine and are shown in Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 6 . The statistical analysis of the concentration dependent studies shows that all 6 candidates have high nanomolar to low micromolar K i and low micromolar IC 50 values ( Fig. 4d ). These results suggest that structure-based design was successful in identifying small-molecule inhibitors that block Aß-LilrB2 interaction in vitro .

To test the inhibitors on cells, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with full-length LilrB2 having monomer red fluorescent protein (mRFP) conjugated at its carboxy-terminus (LilrB2-mRFP). We then tested the interaction of LilrB2 with exogenously added oligomeric Aß42 conjugated at its amino-terminus with fluorescein (FITC-Aß42, Supplementary Fig. 7 ). HEK293T cells transfected with mRFP alone were used as a negative control. After 3 hours of incubation with FITC-Aß42, we fixed and washed the cells, and found the cells transfected with mRFP bind only 13% of FITC-Aß42 relative to cells transfected with LilrB2-mRFP ( Fig. 5a & b ), consistent with previously reported results using HEK293 cells expressing LilrB2 or PirB 26 . These results indicate LilrB2 induces Aß-cell interaction. When we added a 10 μM concentration of our inhibitors to cells before adding FITC-Aß42, we found the amount of bound Aß42 was significantly reduced; the lowest values are 27% (ALI10) and 29% (ALI6) relative to the controls in which no inhibitor was added ( Fig. 5a & b ). These results indicate our selected small molecules inhibit Aß-LilrB2 interaction at the cellular level, and therefore inhibit LilrB2 induced Aß-cell contact.

We selected candidate compound ALI6 to examine its effect on the cytotoxicity of Aß, because ALI6 exhibits the best score in the computational docking and the best inhibitory activity both in vitro and on cell levels. We transfected HEK293T cells with LilrB2-mRFP and treated them with 500 nM oligomeric Aß42 for 24 hours. Cell viability (MTT) assays showed that 38% of cells were killed relative to controls in which the cells were incubated with PBS buffer solutions ( Fig. 5c ). Further cell viability assays established that ALI6 rescues the cells in a dose-dependent manner. When the cells were treated with ALI6 5 minutes prior to adding Aß42, 1 μM ALI6 reduces the cell death to 30%, 2 μM ALI6 reduces the cell death to 24%, 5 μM ALI6 reduces the cell death to 8% and 10μM ALI6 reduces the cell death to 7%. Moreover, 10μM ALI6 in the absence of Aß42 shows no effect on cell viability. These results suggest that ALI6 inhibits Aß cytotoxicity.

Primary neuron models have been widely used to test Aß cytotoxicity and the effect of Aß inhibitors, and two known inhibitors of Aß, curcumin 35 and (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 36 , have been reported to rescue the neurotoxic effects of Aß. We further validated the effect of ALI6 with mouse primary neurons. Cells from cortices dissected at embryonic day 15 were dispersed and cultured for 14 days in vitro (DIV14). Mouse cortical neurons were previously shown to express PirB at DIV14 37 . Cells were then treated with 500 nM FITC-Aß42 to assess Aß binding. We found that cells pre-treated with 10 μM ALI6 bound 39.0 ± 20.5% (mean ± SD) of FITC-Aß42 compared to cells pre-treated with the same amount of DMSO ( Fig. 6a & b ), indicating that ALI6 inhibits the binding of Aß to neurons. The observation that ALI6 does not fully inhibit Aß binding, even at a higher dose (50 μM ALI6, bound 49.9 ± 12.3% FITC-Aß42, Fig. 6b ) indicates there are Aß receptors other than LilrB2 on the neuronal cell surface, and is consistent with the observation of Aß42 binding to neuron cells from PirB −/− mice at 50% the level of wild-type neurons 26 .

Although the binding of Aß was not fully eliminated, we found that ALI6 is sufficient in inhibiting Aß cytotoxicity in primary neurons similar to curcumin 35 and EGCG 36 . Using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays to detect apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we found 50.1 ± 4.3% of the cells treated with Aß42 and DMSO undergo cell death ( Fig. 6c & d ). When DMSO was substituted with same amount of ALI6 (5 μM), cell death dropped to 16.5 ± 8.9%, equivalent to the vehicle control (11.9 ± 11.4%) and ALI6 alone (11.0 ± 11.6%). These results support the potential of ALI6 for rescuing Aß caused neuron damage.

We further tested the effect of ALI6 on the downstream pathway of LilrB2. A previous study proposed that Aß-LilrB2 interaction causes dephosphorylation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor, and leading to eventual synapse loss 26 . Indeed, the same study showed the phosphorylated cofilin (p-cofilin)/total cofilin level decreasing in primary neurons treated with Aß. Here we also found that upon treatment with 150 nM Aß42 for 1 hour, the p-cofilin/cofilin level in primary neurons dropped to 67.5 ± 8.1 % the value seen in cells treated with vehicle alone ( Fig. 6e ). When pre-treated with 3 μM ALI6, the p-cofilin/cofilin level was restored to 101.5 ± 7.4 % relative to vehicle treated cells. These results indicate ALI6 protects neurons from Aß-induced changes in the cofilin signaling pathway, and further support the therapeutic potential of ALI6.

## DISCUSSION
Our interaction assays confirm previous reports that LilrB2 recognizes Aß oligomers 26 , and suggest a molecular mechanism for the specificity of recognition. We first mapped the binding core to the segment 16 KLVFFA 21 of Aß and tested two binding epitopes: a tandem repeat of 16 KLVFFA 21 (Aß 16–21 -TR) designed to spontaneously self-assemble into an anti-parallel ß-sheet, and a single copy peptide (Aß 16–21 -C), which we presume remains single stranded in solution under the conditions tested due to an entropy barrier to oligomer formation. We found that LilrB2 binds to the tandem repeat but not to the single strand ( Fig. 1 ), suggesting that LilrB2 recognizes an antiparallel ß-sheet conformation specific to Aß oligomers 31 .

Several lines of evidence support our hypothesis that Aß 16–21 -TR is a better mimic of the full-length Aß oligomer than is Aß 16–21 -C. Aß 16–21 -TR has more ß strand content than Aß 16–21 -C as indicated by a higher ellipticity (CD) value measured at 200 nm for the peptides linked to the 5x arginine tag (this tag was needed to achieve sufficient solubility) ( Supplementary Fig. 2 , Supplementary Table 1 ). The analysis of CD spectra also shows that the ß strand (antiparallel) content of Aß 16–21 -TR is higher (33%) than that of Aß 16–21 -C (28%). Moreover, when incubated at 37 °C at high concentration (2 mM), Aß 16–21 -TR formed fibers but Aß 16–21 -C did not ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Presuming that fibrillar and oligomeric species share common structural features, these results suggest that Aß 16–21 -TR better mimics the full length Aß oligomer and explain our observation that it is a better epitope for LilrB2. Finally, the Rosetta docking experiments using as input the steric zipper structure of KLVFFA successfully generated a model that agrees with our LilrB2-benzamidine complex structure within the top 0.1% of Rosetta energy rankings. These results support our previous hypothesis that that ß-sheets are not only characteristic of amyloid fibers 38 but also of oligomers 39 , 40 .

The transient and heterogeneous nature of Aß oligomers makes their structural elucidation extremely challenging. The observation that LilrB2 binds to Aß oligomers with a wide range of sizes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) also indicates the difficulty of characterizing the structure of an Aß oligomer-LilrB2 complex. To gain insights into the structure of this complex, we first narrowed the binding core of Aß to a six-residue segment ( 16 KLVFFA 21 ), and identified its binding site on LilrB2 through the structure of LilrB2 with a small molecule that mimics phenylalanine sidechains of the Aß binding core. The binding sites were validated by mutagenesis and Rosetta docking, and then used for structure-based inhibitor design. Our results show that the LilrB2 D1D2-benzamidine complex structure we determined provides a platform sufficient for inhibitor development of the Aß-LilrB2 interaction.

In addition to LilrB2, other putative Aß receptors have been reported to bind Aß oligomers and cause neuronal damage 25 . Our rationale for choosing LilrB2 as a target for inhibitor design is that an animal model shows that mice lacking PirB (the murine homolog of LilrB2) are immune to the damaging effects of Aß in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory 26 . One reason to suppose that blocking only the LilrB2 receptor might be sufficient to inhibit Aß toxicity is that blockade of one high-affinity Aß receptor may sufficiently reduce the contact of Aß with cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Aß42 oligomer binding to cultured cortical neurons from PirB −/− mice is diminished by about 50% relative to wild-type neurons 26 . In AD patients, this reduction may be sufficient to move the equilibrium from Aß-cell contact to Aß clearance 41 , thus inhibiting Aß triggered neuronal toxicity. Our cell viability assays on primary neurons support this hypothesis, which show ALI6 can almost completely block the effect of Aß ( Fig. 6d ). Further study is required to identify the possibility that our inhibitor can also work on other Aß receptors.

Compared to other AD drug development strategies that target Aß aggregation (e.g. 15 – 17 ) or bind monomeric Aß with antibody 42 , targeting Aß oligomer is advantageous because the inhibitor does not need to be added before Aß aggregation. When testing the inhibition of Aß cytotoxicity, Aß monomer or aggregation targeting inhibitors need to be co-incubated with Aß from the beginning of Aß aggregation (e.g. 15 ); therefore, presumably these inhibitors can only treat early-stage AD patients before massive Aß aggregation forms. This may be part of the reason why solanezumab, an antibody targeting monomeric Aß failed in recent clinical trial 43 . In comparison, all of our inhibition experiments were done by separately adding inhibitors and pre-formed Aß oligomer, offering the possibility of treating patients that already have Aß aggregation in their brains.

Structure-based approach has been shown to be a powerful tool for drug development (e.g. 5 , 44 ). In this study, we computationally identified 12 candidate inhibitors by structure-guided selection. Nine out of 12 candidates show inhibition of Aß-LilrB2 interaction in vitro ; 6 candidates were selected for further testing, and all of them exhibit low micro molar to high nanomolar K i and IC 50 values. These inhibitors eliminate the effects of Aß-LilrB2 binding on the cell surface, and candidate ALI6 inhibits Aß binding and cytotoxicity to primary neurons. Our results support the hypothesis that blocking this Aß-receptor interaction is a potential way to inhibit Aß toxicity and prevent neuron damage, and that LilrB2 is a promising therapeutic target. In addition, the compound library we used for computational inhibitor selection is composed of approved drugs, drugs in animal tests and clinical trials, and natural products whose pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or toxicity profile is known. During the inhibitor selection process, we also checked the potential of the selected compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB, Supplementary Table 3 ). This strategy ensures our selected inhibitors, e.g. ALI6, are safe for human use and are able to cross the BBB. These properties make these inhibitors useful tools in further investigation of the role of LilrB2 in pathogenesis of AD and qualifies them as promising candidates for expediting further AD drug development. We also note that concentrations of inhibitors we used are high and might be difficult to achieve in vivo . Our proof-of-concept study provides several promising starting points for drug development, and further work is needed to improve the affinity of these inhibitors to increase their translational values.
