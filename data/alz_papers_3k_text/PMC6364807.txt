Cryo-EM structure of the human α1β3γ2 GABAAreceptor in a lipid bilayer

# Abstract
Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA A Rs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) and the main drivers of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the vertebrate nervous system 1 , 2 . Their dysfunction is implicated in a range of neurological disorders, including depression, epilepsy and schizophrenia 3 , 4 . Amongst the numerous assemblies theoretically possible, α1β2/3γ2 GABA A Rs are most prevalent in the brain 5 . The β3 subunit plays an important role in maintaining inhibitory tone and expression of this subunit alone is sufficient to rescue inhibitory synaptic transmission in a CRISPR/Cas9 derived β1-3 triple knockout 6 . To date, efforts to generate accurate structural models for heteromeric GABA A Rs have been hampered by the use of engineered receptors and the presence of detergents 7 – 9 . Significantly, some recent cryo-EM reconstructions report “collapsed” conformations 8 , 9 which disagree with the prototypical pLGIC, the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 10 , 11 , the large body of structural work on homologous homopentameric receptor variants 12 , and the logic of a ion channel architecture. To address this problem, here we present a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the full-length human α1β3γ2L, a major synaptic GABA A R isoform, functionally reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. The receptor is bound to a positive allosteric modulator megabody and in a desensitised conformation. Unexpectedly, each GABA A R pentamer harbours two phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules, whose head groups occupy positively-charged pockets in the intracellular juxtamembrane regions of α1-subunits. Beyond this level, the intracellular M3-M4 loops are largely disordered, possibly because interacting post-synaptic proteins were not included. This structure illustrates the molecular principles of heteromeric GABA A receptor organization and provides a reference framework for future mechanistic investigations of GABA-ergic signalling and pharmacology.

## Methods
Human α1β3γ2L receptors were expressed using a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cell line 13 adapted to suspension culture. The cell line was not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma contamination. Briefly the cell line comprises the full-length human α1 (Uniprot ID P14867), β3 (Uniprot ID P28472) and γ2L (Uniprot ID P18507-2; ‘long’ isoform) genes, each under individual antibiotic selection. For purification purposes a FLAG-tag was inserted at the N-terminus of the α1 subunit and a (GGS) 3 GK-1D4 tag inserted at the C-terminus of the γ2L subunit. Cells were grown in suspension in Freestyle293 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and selection antibiotics (geneticin, hygromycin-B, zeocin and blasticidin) at 37°C and 8% CO 2 . At a cell density of ~1.5-2x10 6 cells ml -1 expression was induced by addition of doxycycline and sodium butyrate (Sigma) added at 5 mM to enhance expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after ~36 h. Cell pellets from ~1 l of suspension culture were resuspended in 20mM HEPES pH 7,2, 300mM NaCl, 1 % (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). For solubilization a 10% (w/v) solution of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG, Anatrace) and cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS, Anatrace) was prepared at 10:1 molar ratio respectively, and added at 1% (v/v) to the cell suspension. Cells were solubilized for ~1.5 h at 4°C and cell debris and insoluble material removed by centrifugation (10,000 g, 30 min). The supernatant was incubated with 1D4 affinity resin 22 with gentle mixing at 4°C for ~2 h. Resin was recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively with buffer (20mM HEPES pH7.2, 300mM NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) LMNG before on-bead reconstitution into nanodiscs.

MSP2N2 (Addgene, ID 29520) was expressed and purified from E. coli as previously described 33 . Owing to the tendency for detergent purified receptors to aggregate upon elution, α1β3γ2L receptors were incorporated into nanodiscs while attached to 1D4 resin. Briefly, receptors attached to 1D4 resin were mixed with ~1 bed volume of buffer containing phosphatidylcholine (POPC, Avanti; prepared as a 10mg/ml stock in 3% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, DDM, Anatrace – POPC final concentration ~1.2mM) supplemented with bovine brain extract (Sigma-Aldrich – Type I,Folch Fraction I; prepared as a 20mg/ml stock in 3% DDM) at 4°C for ~0.5 h. Lipids were added at a relative ratio of 85:15% POPC:brain extract. Excess lipids were removed by centrifugation before addition of an excess of MSP2N2 (~0.6mg/ml final concentration) to the receptor-bound resin-lipid mixture. The mixture of receptor-bound resin and MSP2N2 were pre-mixed gently at 4°C for ~0.5 h before addition of bio-beads SM2 (~60mg/ml; Bio-rad) to initiate reconstitution. At this point the mixture was incubated at 4°C for ~4 h with constant rotation. The resin/bio-bead mixture was recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively to remove empty nanodiscs; first with 20mM HEPES pH7.2, 300mM NaCl, next with 10mM HEPES pH7.2, 150mM NaCl and finally 10mM HEPES pH7.2, 100mM NaCl. Bound receptor-nanodisc complexes were eluted by addition of 1mM 1D4-peptide in final wash buffer at 4°C for ~16 h. The mixture was applied to EconoPac column (Bio-rad) to remove bio-beads and resin, the receptor-nanodisc complex transferred to 100 kDa Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore) and concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml for cryo-EM grid preparation. Sample monodispersity was assessed by analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography on a Shimadzu HPLC system and negative-stain EM. On the basis of this analysis, further purification of the sample before grid preparation was not required. Western blot analysis of cell lysates and purified receptors was performed using the following primary antibodies; rabbit anti-GABA A α1 (Millipore; 06-868), mouse anti-GABA A β2/3 (Millipore; MAB341) and mouse anti-GABA A γ2 (Synaptic Systems; 224003). Immunoreactivity was detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.

Megabodies (Mbs) are rigid antibody chimeras, built from nanobodies (Nbs) that are grafted onto large scaffold proteins (examples and detailed descriptions of which are to be published in a dedicated methods paper). The particular construct used here, M b Nb 38 cHopQ (called Mb38 throughout the text for simplicity), is a circular permutant of the extracellular adhesin domain of H. pylori (HopQ, UniProt B5Z8H1) 34 which was inserted into the first β-turn connecting β-strands A and B of Nb38 7 . Specifically, the Mb38 open reading frame contains the DsbA leader sequence, followed by a consensus sequence encoding the conserved β-strand A of the Nanobody fold (residues 1-13), followed by the C-terminal part of HopQ (residues 227-449), followed by a three-residues linker connecting the C and the N-termini of HopQ, followed by the N-terminal part of HopQ (residues 49-221). The construct has C-terminal His6 and EPEA tags in frame for affinity purification. Mb38 is monomeric, with a molecular weight of ~58 kDa. Similar to Nbs, Mb38 was expressed as a secreted protein in the periplasm of E. coli WK6 bacteria and purified using nickel affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3,140 mM NaCl. The stock solutions were concentrated to 15 mg/mL, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

Purified α1β3γ2L-nanodisc complexes at 0.5mg/ml were mixed with Mb38 (at 1.2μM) and incubated on ice for 0.5 h prior to cryo-EM grid preparation. 3.5 microlitres of sample was applied to glow-discharged gold R1.2/1.3 300 mesh UltraAuFoil grids (Quantifoil) before blotting for 5 s at ~100% humidity and 14°C, and then plunge-frozen in to liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI).

Data from a single grid was collected over two 24 h sessions on a FEI Titan Krios (ThermoFisher) operated at 300kV and equipped with a Falcon 3EC direct-detector and Volta phase plate. A total of 784 micrographs were collected in electron-counting mode at a nominal magnification of 75,000 corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.07Å. Each micrograph was collected as a 60 s exposure, comprised of 75 movie frames at a dose rate of 0.55e - /p/s for a total accumulated dose of 30.84 e - /Å 2 . Drift correction, beam induced motion and dose-weighting were performed with MotionCor2 35 using a 5 x 5 patch. CTF fitting and phase shift estimation were performed on motion corrected sums without dose weighting with Gctf-v.1.18 36 . Micrographs were manually checked and a total of 737 micrographs (motion corrected sums with dose weighting) used for all other image processing. An initial round of auto-picking on small subset of micrographs was performed in RELION 2.1 37 using a Gaussian blob as a template. Picked particles were subjected to reference-free 2D classification and good classes used for auto-picking on the entire dataset. Autopicked particles were manually inspected and false positives removed, resulting in a total of 370,757 particles. Particles were 2 x binned (pixel size 2.14 Å) for initial processing. Two rounds of 2D classification were carried out in RELION 2.1 and 197,673 particles within classes exhibiting recognizable GABA A R channel features selected for further processing. An initial 3D reference model was generated in RELION and low-pass filtered to 50Å. 3D classification into six classes resulted in four good classes (106,039 particles) and two classes comprised principally of top and bottom views of the receptor-Mb38 complex. Particles from the four best classes were combined, re-extracted (1.07 Å pixel) and refined in RELION 2.1. Particle polishing (RELION 2.1) and CTF-Refine (RELION 3.0) further improved the resolution of the initial reconstruction. A second round of 3D classification, with no image alignment, yielded a single class containing 55,449 particles. 3D refinement of this class yielded a reconstruction at 3.75 Å before post-processing. Applying a soft mask in RELION Post-processing, yielded a final EM map of 3.22 Å. Notably, the calculated soft mask also accounted for density contributed by the nanodisc. Resolution was estimated using Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion. Local resolution was calculated using the MonoRes implementation in Scipion 38 , 39 .

An initial rigid body fit of coordinates for the truncated α1β3γ2 7 was carried out using UCSF Chimera 40 . Owing to the improved resolution of the reconstruction and apparent stability of the receptor complex in the nanodisc, a complete model of the receptor, incorporating nearly all residue side chains, could be built with high accuracy in local geometry. The model was first manually adjusted and refined using COOT 41 and then subjected to global refinement and minimization in real space using PHENIX (‘phenix.real_space_refine’) 42 . Geometric constraints for lipids were generated using GradeServer (Global Phasing Ltd.) and the ligand coordinates docked into densities and refined using COOT 41 .

The ECD and TMD regions in all subunits were well resolved in EM density map, as were the Mb38 and N-linked glycans. However, the HopQ scaffold protein fused to Mb38 was comparatively flexible, with no apparent EM density in the final reconstruction. While density contributed by the nanodisc was evident in the EM reconstruction, the resolution did not permit modelling of the helical belt formed by MSP2N2 scaffold proteins. The final construction allowed for unambiguous assignment of α1, β3 and γ2 subunits and main-chain and sidechain model building. Strong density was observed protruding from the “intracellular” side of the nanodisc proximal to the α1 subunit TM3 and TM4 helices. We modelled this as ~10 residues of the M3-M4 loop of the α1 subunit. Strong density, unaccounted for by the protein backbone, was also apparent at the base of α1 TM3 and M4 helices. This was modelled as PIP2 on the basis of its characteristic shape and orientation at the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Additional density in the “extracellular” layer of the nanodisc was modelled as POPC moieties. Cryo-EM map densities observed within the ion channel and in the (pseudo-)agonist sites were not modelled as we could not reliably determine the identity of a bound ligand.

During model building and refinement, model geometry was assessed using MolProbity 43 . For cross-validations, the final model was refined against the half maps generated by 3D auto-refine in RELION. Subunit interfaces and associated free energies were analysed using the PDBePISA server 44 . Pore diameters were calculated using the HOLE implementation in COOT. Structural figures were made using UCSF Chimera 40 and Pymol (Schrodinger, LLC), including the APBS 45 electrostatics plugin. Structural alignments were performed using the Superpose command in CCP4mg 46 or MatchMaker 40 . Tunnel radii calculations were carried out using the Caver plugin 47 in Pymol.

Computational docking of small molecules to GABA A R cryo-EM structures was performed using AutoDock Vina 48 . Structures of small molecules were optimised using Grade webserver (Global Phasing Ltd.). GABA A R was kept rigid during docking. The whole agonist-binding pocket (~20×20×20 Å 3 ) centered under loop-C was selected for docking.

HEK 293 cells stably transfected with tetracycline inducible human (N)-FLAG-α1β3γ2L-(GGS)3GK-1D4 GABA A 49 , were grown on glass coverslips, and expression was induced by 0.1-2 μg/ml doxycycline for 14 to 28 hours depending on the level of current required. For pulling inside-out macro-patches, we used poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were also treated with kifunensine (5 μg/ml) at the time of induction.

Currents were recorded in either whole-cell or inside-out configuration of patch clamp as previously described 50 using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Ligands were applied via a quad-channel super-perfusion pipette coupled to a piezoelectric element that switched the super-perfusion solution in <1 ms as described previously 51 . Data were acquired using Clampex 8.2 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Data were acquired at either 10, 5 or 2 kHz and filtered at 5, 2 or 1 KHz respectively depending on the duration of the pulse, with longer the recording, the slower the data acquisition rate. Cells were continually perfused with a bath solution consisting of (in mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 and 10 glucose, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). The pipette solution consisted of (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl 2 and 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). For whole-cell recordings, the open pipette resistances ranged from 1.3 – 2.5 MΩ, cell capacitance ranged from 5 – 13 pF and series resistance ranged from 0.2 – 2.5 MΩ. Series resistances were electronically compensated by >85% with a lag of 10 μs. The liquid junction potential between the bath and pipette solution was −2 mV and was corrected post recordings. Cells and patches were voltage-clamped at −52 mV. For inside-out patches, the solutions were reversed, i.e., the pipettes were filled with the bath solution and the patches were perfused with the pipette solution. The pipette resistance for inside-out patches ranged from 4 – 6 MΩ. In all patch protocols, initially currents were repeatedly elicited with pulses of etomidate until stable currents were obtained before proceeding with the application of modulatory agents as described in the figure legend. For analysis 2 – 5 identical traces from the same patch were averaged, and the ones before the patch was stabilized were disregarded. The peak current amplitudes obtained with inside-out patches ranged between 7 – 44 pA.

Current traces were analyzed using Clampfit 9.0 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Statistical analysis (paired or unpaired Students t test) was done in Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are shown as mean ± SD. Each n represents a different patch or cell. Current traces were normalized in Origin 6 for presentation. The enhancement data for Mb38 was fitted by nonlinear least squares in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).

The functionality of the receptors reconstituted in nanodiscs, in the presence or absence of Mb38 megabody, was assessed using radioligand binding assays. Modulation of 2 nM [ 3 H]flunitrazepam or [ 3 H]muscimol binding by varying concentrations of GABA or etomidate, respectively, was measured using WGA coated YSi scintillation proximity assay beads (SPA, PerkinElmer). Background binding was determined by displacement of [ 3 H]flunitrazepam or [ 3 H]muscimol with 100 μM diazepam or with 10 mM GABA respectively. Each reaction contained ~5 μg/ml purified receptor and 1 mg/ml SPA beads suspended in 10 mM HEPES pH7.5 and 100 mM NaCl. Data normalization, graph preparation and nonlinear least squares curve fitting to a single-site binding model were performed in Igor Pro 7 (WaveMetrics).
