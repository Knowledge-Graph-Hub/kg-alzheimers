Serum neurofilament dynamics predicts neurodegeneration and clinical progression in presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising fluid biomarker of disease progression for various cerebral proteopathies. Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoas-say technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid ( n = 187) and serum ( n = 405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics ( n = 196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-β deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini–Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker.

## Methods
Participants at 50% risk of carrying an autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease mutation in one of three genes ( APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 ) were enrolled in the DIAN observational study (National Institute on Aging grant no. U19 AG032438; dian.wustl.edu ; clinical trial no. NCT00869817) 18 . DIAN participants are assessed at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits (annually to every third year). Assessment included collection of body fluids (CSF, blood), clinical testing (CDR), neuropsychological testing (including MMSE (raw scores) and the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (story A), raw scores for immediate and delayed recall), and imaging modalities (MRI, PET with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET), and 18 F-FDG) as described in earlier publications 1 , 2 , 40 – 42 . The institutional review board at Washington University in St. Louis provided supervisory review and human studies approval. Participants or their caregivers provided informed consent in accordance with their local institutional review boards. NfL analysis in the DIAN cohort was approved by the ethics committee at the medical faculty of the University of Tübingen, Germany (project number 718/2014BO2). The detailed number of participants (mutation carriers, non-carriers) for baseline and longitudinal measurements are given in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and the legends of Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 .

The presence of dementia (symptoms) was assessed using the CDR 41 . Clinical evaluators were blinded to each participant’s mutation status. For every visit a participant’s EYO was calculated based on the participant’s age at the visit relative to their ‘mutation-specific’ expected age at dementia onset. The mutation-specific expected age of dementia onset was computed by averaging the reported age of dementia onset across individuals with the same specific mutation 20 . If the mutation-specific expected age at dementia onset was unknown, the EYO was calculated from the age at which parental cognitive decline began. The parental age of clinical symptom onset was determined by a semi-structured interview with the use of all available historical data. The EYO was calculated identically for both mutation carriers and non-carriers. Mutation status was determined using PCR-based amplification of the appropriate exon followed by Sanger sequencing 1 .

Fluids were collected in the morning under fasting conditions by venipuncture using a 21 gauge (G) butterfly needle and red top plain Vacutainer tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company). After blood collection the tubes were left upside at room temperature for 30 min to allow clotting. After clotting, tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 min at room temperature. Serum was taken with a disposable, non-sterile transfer pipette into a single transfer tube (SARSTEDT AG & Co. KG) and immediately frozen on dry ice. After venipuncture, CSF was collected by gravity drip into two 13 ml polypropylene tubes using standard lumbar puncture procedures (L4-L5) with an atraumatic Sprotte spinal needle (22 G). As with serum, CSF was flash-frozen upright on dry ice. Samples collected in the United States were shipped overnight on dry ice to the DIAN biomarker core laboratory at Washington University, whereas samples collected at non-United States sites were stored at −80 °C and shipped quarterly on dry ice to Washington University. At the core laboratory the frozen samples were subsequently thawed, combined into a single polypropylene tube of serum or CSF, and aliquoted (300 or 500 μl) into polypropylene Corning microcentrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific), after which they were again flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. For the current study, all available DIAN serum samples (data freeze 11) were shipped to the DIAN site in Tübingen. CSF samples (data freeze 9) were shipped to the DIAN site in Munich first and used for another analysis before being shipped to the DIAN site in Tübingen. Thus, CSF samples had one additional freeze–thaw cycle in Munich; however, prior work has indicated no significant effect of up to four freeze–thaw cycles on NfL in CSF 43 .

CSF and serum NfL measurements were performed using a highly sensitive single-molecule array assay using the capture monoclonal antibody 47:3 and the biotinylated detection antibody 2:1 (UmanDiagnostics AB) 44 . The samples were measured in duplicate on a Simoa HD-1 platform (Quanterix) using a two-step neat assay. Serum samples were measured at 1:4 and CSF at 1:10 dilution (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% non-fat milk powder, HeteroBlock (300 ug ml −1 ; Omega Biologicals)). Batch-prepared calibrators (bovine lyophilized NfL) ranging from 0 to 10,000 pg ml −1 were stored at −80 °C (Uman Diagnostics AB). All samples were measured blinded. For serum, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation of duplicate determinations for concentration was 4.2%. In the CSF, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.7%. Inter-assay variability was evaluated with three native serum samples and three native CSF samples. The inter-assay coefficients of variation for serum were 7.7% (mean concentration 13.3 pg ml −1 ), 2.9% (30.9 pg ml −1 ), and 3.7% (269.9 pg ml −1 ). In the CSF, the interassay coefficients of variation were 2.4% (445.4 pg ml −1 ), 12.2% (1486.3 pg ml −1 ), and 13.3% (14,049.0 pg ml −1 ). Note that the concentrations (pg ml −1 ) are calculated from the full-length NfL calibrator and thus may overestimate the concentration of an NfL fragment in the blood.

MRI was performed at the different DIAN sites on 3T scanners using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. T1-weighted images (1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 mm 3 voxels) were acquired for all participants. The ADNI Imaging Core screened images for artifacts and protocol compliance. FreeSurfer version 5.3 was used to perform volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction to define subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Members of the DIAN Imaging Core examined each segmentation and edited them as needed. Cortical thickness measures were averaged across hemispheres. Since the precuneus region has been shown to be most sensitive to Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease 2 , 24 , we focused our analyses on this region a priori.

Amyloid-β-PET imaging was done using a bolus injection of ¹¹C-PiB. Acquisition consisted of a 70-min scan starting at injection or a 30-min scan beginning 40 min after injection. Data in the common 40–70 min time frame were converted to regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) relative to the cerebellar gray matter using FreeSurfer-derived ROIs (PET Unified Pipeline, https://github.com/ysu001/PUP ). Metabolic imaging was done with 18 F-FDG PET with a 30 min dynamic acquisition beginning 30 min after injection. Data from the 40–60 min time frame were converted to SUVRs relative to cerebellar gray matter. The ADNI Imaging Core verified that the PET images were acquired using the established protocol and free of substantial artifacts. All PET data were partial volume-corrected using a regional spread function technique. Scanner-specific spatial filters were applied to achieve a common resolution (8 mm) across PET scanners. MRI and PET data acquisition and processing has been described in detail in previous studies 1 , 2 , 24 . Again, for the present analyses, we averaged SUVR values from the bilateral precuneus ROIs defined on the MRI.

The relationship between baseline CSF and serum NfL was determined by using LMEMs implemented in R version 3.4.2 and RStudio version 1.1.453 using the package lme4, including a random intercept term for family and fixed effect for baseline age, sex, and baseline CSF NfL, with baseline serum NfL as the dependent variable. Separate models were fitted for non-carriers and mutation carriers. Baseline CSF and serum NfL values were log-transformed (due to non-normal distribution) before being entered into the model. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

The relationship between EYO and baseline CSF and serum NfL values was estimated using LMEMs. As previously done, to account for potential non-linear effects, EYO was modeled as a restricted cubic spline with knots at the 0.10, 0.50, and 0.90 quantiles 2 . The LMEMs for the baseline NfL values (CSF or serum) included: fixed effects for mutation status; the linear EYO component; the cubic EYO component; the linear EYO by mutation status interaction; the cubic EYO by mutation status interaction; and a random intercept for family. Model parameters were estimated using an open source package for Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses, Stan ( http://mc-stan.org/ ) 45 , 46 , implemented using R. This resampling approach leads to a distribution of parameter estimates across iterations. From this distribution it is possible to estimate the 99% credible intervals of the model fits at every EYO for non-carriers, mutation carriers, and the distribution of the difference between non-carriers and mutation carriers. The first EYO where groups (non-carriers and mutation carriers) differed was determined to be the first point where the 99% credible intervals around the differences distribution between non-carriers and mutation carriers did not overlap 0. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

Longitudinal data was modeled using LMEMs. LMEMs are a powerful approach to account for the covariance structure introduced by serial measurements and are ideal to deal with imperfect timing or an unbalanced number of data points. The rate of change in log-transformed serum NfL for each individual was modeled using an LMEM with fixed effects of time from baseline (in years), mutation status, a time from baseline by mutation status interaction, and a random intercept for family, as well as random slope and intercept terms for each participant. The rate of NfL change for each individual was extracted from the model estimates for subsequent analyses. This model was also used for generating the rate of change for cortical thickness,18F-FDG PET, and PiB-PET, for each individual (for plotting purposes). See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

As with the cross-sectional estimates, the relationship between EYO and rate of change in serum NfL was estimated using an LMEM in Stan. The EYO was modeled as a restricted cubic spline with knots at the 0.10, 0.50, and 0.90 quantiles. The LMEM model for the rate of change in serum NfL included: fixed effects for mutation status; the linear EYO component; the cubic EYO component; the linear EYO by mutation status interaction; the cubic EYO by mutation status interaction; and a random intercept for family. Model parameters were estimated using Stan. Again, this resampling approach leads to a distribution of parameters estimates across iterations, resulting in 99% credible intervals of the model fits at every EYO for non-carriers, mutation carriers, and the distribution of the difference between non-carriers and mutation carriers. The first EYO where groups (non-carriers and mutation carriers) differed was determined to be the first point where the 99% credible intervals around the differences distribution between non-carriers and mutation carriers did not overlap 0.

To determine whether the extracted rate of change in serum NfL was significantly different across mutation status and cognitive status we categorized mutation carriers based on cognitive status, where presymptomatic mutation carriers were individuals who scored as CDR = 0 across all visits ( n = 65), converters were mutation carriers who scored as CDR = 0 at baseline and CDR > 0 at subsequent visits ( n = 13), and symptomatic mutation carriers were individuals who scored as CDR > 0 across all visits ( n = 55). We used LMEMs, including a random intercept for family and fixed effects for baseline age, sex, and group (that is, non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, converters, or symptomatic mutation carriers), where group was the term of interest, and the extracted rate of change in serum NfL was the dependent variable. Models were computed using lme4 in R. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

We tested the hypothesis of whether individuals who have an earlier expected age of onset (for example, age of onset of 30 years old versus 55 years old) have an accelerated NfL rate of change. First, to determine if a participant deviated from its expected NfL rate of change, given its baseline EYO, we calculated the median rate of change in NfL at each EYO, generated from model estimates (for the calculation, see ‘Baseline CSF and serum NfL and longitudinal NfL as a function of EYO’ in the Supplementary statistical analysis ; for the depiction of median values, see the red line in Fig. 2b ). We then took each participant’s extracted NfL rate of change and subtracted the median value corresponding to its baseline EYO. This resulting value represented the deviation from the expected value, whereby a positive value on this deviation measure indicates that an individual has a higher rate of change in serum NfL (that is, worse) than would be expected given their EYO. Conversely, a negative value on this deviation measure indicates that an individual has a lower rate of change in serum NfL (that is, better) than would be expected given their EYO. Next, to investigate if there was a relationship between individuals with the higher deviation measure and earlier expected age of onset, we grouped individuals by their expected age of onset (determined by their specific mutation type, grouped as age of onset 20–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60+). See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

The longitudinal relationship between the rate of change in serum NfL and concurrent rate of change in cortical thickness, metabolism, or amyloid-β accumulation was determined within each group of interest (that is, non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, and symptomatic mutation carriers). Therefore, separate models were run for each non-carrier, presymptomatic mutation carrier, and symptomatic mutation carrier groups. The dependent term for each model was an imaging biomarker with fixed effect terms for baseline age, sex, time from baseline, extracted rate of change in serum NfL, and interaction between time from baseline and rate of change in serum NfL. Models contained random slope and intercept terms for participants and random intercepts for family. The primary term of interest was the interaction between the rate of change in serum NfL and the time from baseline term. Models were fitted using lme4 in R.

To determine whether the relationship between groups was different, a model for each imaging modality containing all groups was run. Each model was fitted containing fixed effect terms for baseline age, sex, time from baseline, extracted rate of change in serum NfL, group (non-carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers, or symptomatic mutation carriers), and two- and three-way interaction between time from baseline, rate of change in serum NfL, and group. Converters were included as part of the symptomatic mutation carrier group. The models also included random slope and intercept terms for the participants and random intercepts for family. The dependent variables were the longitudinal measures for cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, or amyloid-β deposition in the precuneus ROI. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

To examine whether baseline serum NfL could predict subsequent changes in cortical thickness and cognition in mutation carriers we fitted LMEMs with random slope and intercept terms for participants, random intercepts for family, and fixed effect terms for baseline age, sex, time, log-transformed baseline serum NfL, and an interaction between time and baseline serum NfL. The interaction term was the term of interest. The dependent terms entered into the models were longitudinal precuneus cortical thickness measurements, MMSE scores, and Logical Memory test scores. If significant, an association of baseline serum NfL with rate of change in cortical thickness or cognition was assumed. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

To determine whether the rate of change in serum NfL could predict subsequent changes in cortical thickness or cognition, we conducted a truly prospective study, whereby after longitudinal serum collection for NfL, we collected additional imaging and neuropsychological data on 39 mutation carriers. Twenty-eight individuals completed additional imaging and neuropsychological testing, 9 completed only additional neuropsychological testing but no MRI, and 2 who completed an additional MRI but not neuropsychological testing. To determine the rate of change in cortical thickness and cognition (MMSE, Logical Memory test) between the imaging and cognitive assessment concurrent to the participant’s last blood draw and follow-up session, we fitted an LMEM for each participant, where the dependent variable was the imaging or cognitive variable of interest at last serum visit and follow-up visit and the independent variable was the time between visits. Models were run in R. We then used this rate of change for cortical thickness or cognition as the dependent variable in an LMEM, which included fixed effects for age, sex, and the rate of change in serum NfL, and a random intercept term for family. The term of interest was the serum NfL rate of change. Models were fitted using lme4 in R. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

The unstandardized regression coefficients ( B ), standard error of the mean (s.e.m.), and P values from the LMEMs and linear regression models are reported in the figure legends. The statistical analyses mentioned in the figure legends of Extended Data Figs. 2 – 4 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 were conducted using the JMP software, version 13.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). For the analysis of Extended Data Fig. 3c a regression model was created, which approximates the changes of non-carriers and mutation carriers. The model uses the rate of change of log serum NfL over EYO. For non-carriers a slightly increasing line over the entire time period was created representing the NfL increase over age. For mutation carriers the same development was taken for the very early years until a bifurcation point indicating the divergence of non-carriers and mutation carriers. From this point on, mutation carriers were shown with a rising slope up to a break of slope, when the line came to a parallel increase as non-carriers. This model uses one common slope at the very beginning, one bifurcation point, and one shift leading to two parallel slopes after symptom onset. See also Supplementary statistical analysis .

## Extended Data
a , b , Difference of posterior distribution for baseline CSF NfL ( n = 187) ( a ) and baseline serum NfL ( n = 405) ( b ) as a function of EYO. The solid red lines depict the median of the difference distribution; the shaded area represents the 99% equal-tailed credible intervals. EYO was considered statistically significant if the 99% equal-tailed credible intervals of the posterior distribution did not overlap 0 (6.8 years before EYO for both baseline CSF and serum NfL). For the absolute values of baseline CSF and serum NfL, see Fig. 1a,b .

a , Two-tailed pairwise Student’s t -test comparisons of CSF NfL levels of carriers of a mutation in APP ( n = 14), PSEN1 ( n = 82), or PSEN2 ( n = 11). b , Same analysis, using a two-tailed pairwise Student’s t -test for the serum NfL of carriers of a mutation in APP ( n = 39), PSEN1 ( n = 185), or PSEN2 ( n = 19). No differences in log(CSF NfL) or log(serum NfL) were found between the groups ( F (2, 104)= 1.8108, P = 0.1686 and F (2, 240)= 1.9205, P = 0.1488, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found by two-tailed pairwise Student’s t -test when age and disease status (presymptomatic, symptomatic) were treated as covariates. The boxes map to the median, 25th and 75th quintiles, and the whiskers extend to the 1.5 × IQR.

a , Spaghetti plot showing longitudinal serum NfL for non-carriers (NC, n = 63, blue) and mutation carriers (MC, n = 133, red) as a function of EYO. These are the same data as in Fig. 2a but with a logarithmic scale on the y axis to better appreciate the changes during the presymptomatic stage (for details, see Fig. 2a ). b , Difference of posterior distribution for serum NfL rate of change between mutation carriers and non-carriers, as a function of EYO ( n = 196). The solid red line depicts the median of the difference distribution, and the shaded area represents the 99% equal-tailed credible intervals. EYO was considered statistically significant if the 99% equal-tailed credible intervals of the posterior distribution did not overlap 0 (16.2 years before EYO). c , Individual estimated rate of change in serum NfL (same data as in Fig. 2b , n = 63 for non-carriers and n = 133 for mutation carriers). A regression analysis was performed with two breaks of slope (see Methods for calculation). With this model the first bifurcation point was found at −18.6 years before EYO, the second at −5.8 years before EYO.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis for non-carriers (NC) versus presymptomatic mutation carriers (MC) and non-carriers versus symptomatic mutation carriers with cross-sectional (baseline serum NfL) and longitudinal (serum NfL rate of change per year) data. The true positive fraction (sensitivity) is on the y axis and the false positive fraction (1-specificity) on the x axis. The area under the curve (AUC, accuracy), as well as the cutoff value and χ 2 P value from the logistic regression are shown. The chance level of the area under the curve is 0.50. Converters (for rate of change, see Fig. 2c ) were considered presymptomatic mutation carriers.

a , Using two-tailed pairwise Student’s t -tests, no differences in the rate of change of log(serum NfL) (year −1 ) levels among APP ( n = 24), PSEN1 ( n = 104), and PSEN2 ( n = 5) mutation carriers ( F (2, 130) = 0.4678, P = 0.6274) was found. Similarly, no differences were found when age and disease status (presymptomatic, symptomatic) were treated as covariates in a two-tailed pairwise Student’s t -test. b , No difference between an individual’s deviation from the EYO-adjusted median rate of change in NfL and their expected age of symptom onset using LMEMs. Individuals were grouped in 4 categories with expected symptom onset at 20–39 ( n = 17), 40–49 ( n = 54), 50–59 ( n = 56), and over 60 years of age ( n = 6); group comparisons, P > 0.146. See Methods for the calculations. The boxes map to the median, 25th and 75th quintiles, and the whiskers extend to the 1.5 × IQR.
