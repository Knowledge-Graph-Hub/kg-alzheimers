# Title
Multi-site study of the relationships betweenante mortem[11C]PIB-PET Centiloid values andpost mortemmeasures of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology.

# Abstract
We sought to establish the relationships between standard post mortem measures of AD neuropathology and ante mortem [ 11 C]PIB-PET analyzed with the Centiloid (CL) method, a standardized scale for Aβ-PET quantification. Four centers contributed 179 participants encompassing a broad range of clinical diagnoses, PET data and autopsy findings. CL values increased with each CERAD neuritic plaque score increment (median −3 CL for no plaques, 92 CL for frequent plaques) and non-linearly with Thal Aβ phases (increases were detected starting at phase 2) with overlap between scores/phases. Findings were comparable across sites and when restricted to 56 patients who died within 2 years of PET. A threshold of 12.2 CL detected CERAD moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques (AUC=0.910, Sensitivity=89.2%, Specificity=86.4%) while 24.4 CL identified intermediate-to-high AD neuropathological changes (AUC=0.894, Sensitivity=84.1%, Specificity=87.9%). Our study demonstrated the robustness of a multi-site Centiloid [ 11 C]PIBPET study and established a range of pathology-based CL thresholds.

## Introduction.
The development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiotracers with high affinity and specificity to aggregated Aβ pathology [ 1 ] was a milestone in the study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the heterogeneity of Aβ-PET methods and lack of standardization have hampered the field by limiting between-study comparability and data sharing. Though multi-tracer studies suggest that quantification of Aβ with different radiotracers yields highly correlated results, the tracers differ in the recommended reference and target regions used to derive Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) values and in the dynamic range of SUVRs in different clinical populations [ 2 , 3 ]. In studies applying the same radiotracer, heterogeneity arises from differences in data acquisition (scanner properties, acquisition time window), reconstruction parameters, quantitative methods, and image preprocessing pipelines (selection of reference and target regions, use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), preprocessing in native or template space, etc.). Finally, different approaches are used to define thresholds of AβPET positivity, i.e. to determine whether the scan shows evidence for Aβ deposition [ 4 – 6 ].

The Centiloid project was designed to address these issues by proposing a standardized PET processing pipeline and a method to transform resulting PET binding metrics into a common unit called “Centiloid” (CL) [ 7 ]. The Centiloid scale is anchored at 0 and 100 CL, with 0 CL representing a definitively Aβ-negative brain (originally calculated as the average value of a group of healthy subjects below age 45), and 100 CL reflecting the average signal observed in patients with typical mild-to-moderate AD dementia [ 8 ]. This harmonized method (originally designed with [ 11 C]PIB but applicable to other tracers after calibration [ 9 , 10 ]), has great potential to produce cohesive and comparable research results from disparate labs across the world and stimulate collaborations and data sharing.

Proper interpretation of Aβ-PET findings requires a clear understanding of the relationships between PET data and underlying Aβ neuropathology. One important application of the Centiloid method would be to provide standardized and generalizable cutoffs for Aβ-PET “positivity” based on post-mortem data. Previous studies have shown strong correlations between Aβ-PET positivity, as determined by visual interpretation or quantification, and multiple indices of Aβ neuropathology [ 11 – 16 ]. However, these investigations were generally small because of the difficulty of gathering large groups of patients with imaging and pathology data, and each study measured PET binding using laboratory-specific pipelines and units, limiting comparability across studies.

The goal of the present study was twofold. First, we aimed to assess the feasibility of a retrospective multi-site [ 11 C]PIB-PET study using the Centiloid approach. Second, we aimed to investigate the relationships between [ 11 C]PIB-PET imaging, as measured in CL, and standard measures of AD neuropathology, and to determine CL thresholds grounded in neuropathological standards.

## Methods
The first step of the study ( Figure 1A ) involved implementing the Centiloid standard pipeline and reproducing the results derived from the original dataset to calibrate the scale at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). This was performed using the original Centiloid dataset [ 7 ] downloaded from the Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network website ( www.gaain.org ), as described in the Supplementary methods .

We then gathered and analyzed ante mortem [ 11 C]PIB-PET images from patients who also had available autopsy reports ( Figure 1B ). Five academic sites contributed: UCSF; University of California Davis, UCD (UCSF and UCD participants were lumped as they all underwent PET at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory); University of Pittsburgh, UPitt; the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota; and the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. [ 11 C]PIB-PET images were preprocessed using the Centiloid standard pipeline (to calculate SUVR values and convert them to CL) at the Mayo Clinic for the subset of Mayo subjects [ 6 ], and at UCSF for all other sites.

Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships between resulting CL values and three neuropathologic scales. We first considered the two indices of Aβ neuropathology: Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) score [ 17 ] and Thal phase [ 18 ]. Neither of these scales are meant to be quantitative measures of total Aβ load, and instead reflect different aspects of Aβ pathology. CERAD score is determined on a 4-point semi-quantitative scale reflecting the maximal neuritic plaque density observed in selected neocortical areas, while Thal is a 6-point scalecapturing the progressive stereotypic topography of Aβ (neuritic and diffuse) deposits. In addition to these Aβ-centric scales, we studied AD Neuropathologic Change (ADNC) levels, which combine information from Aβ (CERAD and Thal) and tau pathology (Braak staging [ 19 ]) into a global four-point summary scale recommended for AD neuropathologic diagnosis [ 20 ].

179 Individuals with ante mortem [ 11 C]PIB-PET, MRI and autopsy reports were included. This sample partly overlaps with previous papers published by each site [ 11 , 13 , 21 – 24 ] and included 22 cognitively normal older adults, 27 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 63 with AD dementia, and 67 with non-AD dementia, who died 3.3 years after [ 11 C]PIB-PET on average. Participants’ characteristics varied across sites: UCSF/UCD patients were the youngest and included a majority (62%) of cases with nonAD syndromes (primarily in the frontotemporal dementia spectrum) while most UPitt patients had a clinical diagnosis of AD (59%). Mayo participants were the oldest, and evenly distributed across diagnoses ( Table 1 , and Supplementary Tables 1–3 for details on clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses, respectively).

The current study being a retrospective collaborative effort, imaging and neuropathologic data were acquired by each site following their own procedures, as described in the Supplementary methods . Briefly, PET data were acquired 40-to-60 min (Mayo) or 50-to-70 min post injection (all other centers) with site-specific scanners (PET or PET-CT). Various methods were used for attenuation correction (e.g. using an external radioactive positron-emitting source or a low dose CT scan) and PET reconstruction (e.g. filtered back-projection or ordered subset expectation maximization); see center-by-center details in the Supplementary methods . T1-weighted MRIs were acquired using various 1.5, 3, or 4T scanners.

Relationships between the three neuropathologic scales and CL values were first assessed using Spearman correlations; Mann-Whitney tests were also run to conduct pairwise comparisons for each increment of the scales.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to derive pathology-based CL thresholds. Our first contrast of interest was based on discriminating between “none-to-sparse” and “moderate-to-frequent” neuritic plaques as scored by CERAD, similar to previous studies on FDA-approved [ 18 F]-labelled tracers [ 14 , 25 ]. This contrast corresponds to the difference between C scores of 0–1 versus 2–3 according to the ABC neuropathologic score used for AD neuropathologic diagnosis [ 20 ].

In addition, we conducted an equivalent analysis based on Thal phase, contrasting Phases 0-to-2 and 3-to-5 (equivalent to A scores of 0–1 versus 2–3 in the ABC framework [ 20 ]). Lastly, we aimed to distinguish “intermediate-to-high” and “none-to-low” ADNC levels, as the former “should be considered adequate explanation of cognitive impairment or dementia” [ 20 ]. It is notable that intermediate-to-high ADNC levels require Braak stage ≥III and that, although [ 11 C]PIB-PET does not measure tau pathology, higher Braak stages are also usually associated with higher Aβ levels [ 13 ], suggesting that higher CL values, corresponding to higher neocortical Aβ burden, may be expected in patients in advanced versus early Braak stages.

Additional ROC analyses were conducted to explore discrimination at each increment of each of the three neuropathologic scales. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and exact binomial 95%CI were computed and optimal thresholds were determined based on Youden’s index.

## Results
CL values ranged from −26 to 167 CL and showed a bi-modal distribution, with a large number of subjects centered around either 0 or 100 CL ( Figure 1B ). CL values varied across clinical diagnosis (Kruskal-Wallis: p<0.001, η 2 H =0.302, Figure 1B ); patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD had a median value of 99 CL although values spanned the full range of the scale.

Figure 2A illustrates the distribution of CERAD scores and Thal phases, showing that our cohort encompassed a broad range of Aβ pathology levels. CL values increased with CERAD scores (ρ=0.716, p<0.001), and significant differences were found for each increment (p’s<0.02, Figure 2A ). CL values increased with Thal phases (ρ=0.768, p<0.001) but pairwise comparisons showed detectable PET signal increase beginning at phase 2 (versus Phase 0: p=0.01, versus Phase 1: p=0.066; see Figure 2A ). Regression analyses confirmed the nonlinear relationship between Thal phase and [ 11 C]PIB-PET: a model including a quadratic term (Thal 2 ) explained PET signal (R 2 =59.2%) better than a simple linear model (R 2 =57.2%; ΔR 2 =1.9%, p=0.007). When entering CERAD, Thal and Thal 2 in a stepwise regression, the final model included CERAD and Thal 2 (both p≤0.001) and explained 61.4% of total CL variance.

Figure 2B shows the relationships between CERAD, ADNC and CL values. CERAD and ADNC scales were correlated but not synonymous in categorizing patients as having low or high pathology, particularly when CERAD moderate-to-frequent cases had low Braak stage and therefore fell into the “low” ADNC level. [ 11 C]PIB-PET binding was correlated with ADNC levels (ρ=0.736, p<0.001), and CL values increased with every ADNC increment (p’s<0.02).

Supplementary Table 3 describes the relationships between the three neuropathologic scales and CL values in detail.

The results of ROC analyses are displayed in Table 2 ; the three contrasts of interest are discussed below.

[ 11 C]PIB-PET distinguished individuals with moderate-to-frequent (n=120) versus noneto-sparse (n=59) CERAD scores with high accuracy (AUC=0.910, 95%CI[0.858, 0.948] see Supplementary Figure 1 ). A threshold of 12.2 CL separated groups with a sensitivity of 89.2% and a specificity of 86.4%, positive/negative predictive values of 93.0/79.7%, and positive/negative likelihood ratios of 6.58/0.13. It should be noted that the cutoff to distinguish none and sparse-to-frequent groups also was 12.2 CL (83.3% sensitivity, 100% specificity).

Table 3 describes the 21 individuals that were misclassified applying this threshold. Eight participants were “false positive” (i.e. CERAD none/sparse and CL>12.2, between 20 and 88), although all had detectable Aβ neuropathology (sparse neuritic plaques for all 8, with Thal phases between 2 and 4). Half (n=4) had a neuropathologic diagnosis of Lewy Body Disease, and half (n=4) had intermediate ADNC levels. The 13 “false negative” participants (i.e. CERAD moderate/frequent and CL <12.2) had CL values between −19.7 and 8.1. Three cases had maximal CERAD and Thal scores, including two patients with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD); visual inspection of these two cases ( Supplementary Figure 2 ), showed that the low CL values were due to contamination of the cerebellar reference region rather than the absence of cortical binding. Removing the ADAD patients (n=3, including these two negative patients and a case with 168 CL) did not impact threshold calculation ( Supplementary Table 4 ).

The threshold estimated to detect Thal phase 3-to-5 versus 0-to-2 was 23.5 CL (85.8% sensitivity, 95.9% specificity, 98.0%/74.6% positive/negative predictive values, and 21.03/0.15 positive/negative likelihood ratios).

The threshold estimated to detect intermediate-to-high ADNC levels was 24.4 CL (84.1% sensitivity, 87.9% specificity, 92.2%/76.3% positive/negative predictive values, and 6.94/0.18 positive/negative likelihood ratios).

Additional analyses were conducted to extend the previous findings and to test their robustness.

Significant CL/CERAD associations were found in the three main centers ( Figure 3A , see Supplementary Figure 3 for comparable analyses with Thal phases).

CL/CERAD correlations were unchanged when repeating the analyses in the subset of 56 participants who died within 2 years of PET ( Figure 3B , see Supplementary Figure 4 for Thal analyses and other PET-to-death intervals). The ROC analysis was repeated to distinguish the 39 moderate-to-frequent from the 24 none-to-sparse CERAD cases with PET-death interval ≤2 years, resulting in AUC=0.866 [0.755, 0.939] and a threshold of 13 CL.

Three clinicians (O.H.L., H.J.R., W.J.J.) read the 73 UCSF/UCD [ 11 C]PIB-PET SUVR images as negative or positive for cortical binding [ 26 ], blind to clinical information and PET quantification ( Figure 3C ). Among the 27 cases read as negative by all three raters, 26 had CL values below 12.2, and one case was slightly above threshold (13.8 CL; neuropathology showed CERAD frequent and Thal phase 3). Out of the 30 cases that were read as positive by consensus, all CL values were above 12.2 CL (minimum value =12.3 CL), and 27 were above 24.4 CL. Among the 16 cases with between-rater disagreement in visual interpretation, three (all with frequent CERAD scores) had CL>12.2 (14.9, 24.4, and 33.2 CL) and were read as positive by 2/3 readers. Overall, the six cases with CL values between 12.2 and 24.4, all of whom had CERAD moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques, received positive reads 13 of 18 (6 cases x 3 readers) possible times (72%). The 30 cases above 24 CL received positive reads 89 of 90 possible times (99%); the only negative read coming from a case with 33.2 CL.

CL values were extremely variable in individuals within a given CERAD score ( Figure 2A ), independent of center and PET-to-death interval ( Figure 3 ). To test whether this variability reflects actual variability in Aβ load not captured by the CERAD scale, we assessed the correlation between Thal phases and CL values in individuals with maximal (frequent) CERAD score. CL values correlated with Thal stage in this sample (ρ=0.335, p=0.003) and in the subset of the sample with PET-to-death interval ≤2 years (ρ=0.654, p<0.001; Figure 3D ).

## Discussion
In this investigation of 179 individuals, we assessed relationships between AD neuropathology and [ 11 C]PIB-PET imaging quantified with the Centiloid scale. We aimed to better characterize the link between [ 11 C]PIB-PET imaging and its underlying target, and to test the robustness of the Centiloid approach to analyze multisite [ 11 C]PIB-PET data.

CERAD score and Thal phase both contributed to global [ 11 C]PIB-PET signal, and together accounted for ~60% of the CL variance. However, this does not signify that 40% of the PET signal is unrelated to Aβ pathology: CERAD and Thal measures are ordinal, non-linear scales that do not necessarily reflect the total Aβ burden. For instance, a focal area of high density of neuritic plaques in one sampled brain region is sufficient to classify as CERAD frequent [ 17 ] even if the rest of the cortex shows no or sparse plaques. Similarly, Thal phases represent the topography of neuritic and diffuse Aβ deposits in different regions, but do not directly reflect the quantitative Aβ burden in these regions. More quantitative, continuous measures of Aβ burden – e.g. a measure of Aβ concentration by ELISA, mass spectroscopy, or a histochemical measure that included both fluorescent intensity and surface area of Aβ plaques, each performed over a broad area similar to the Centiloid target region - would be expected to better correlate with global PET values.

The independent contribution of Thal phase is consistent with a previous study based on a partly overlapping sample [ 13 ], and could reflect [ 11 C]PIB binding to fibrillary components of non-neuritic Aβ deposits (that are sometimes “diffuse”) that are not captured by the CERAD score [ 11 – 13 , 22 , 27 ]. Alternatively, this relationship might be confounded by the previously highlighted correlation between Thal phases and cortical neuritic plaque density [ 13 ], reflecting the fact that Aβ pathology progression is characterized by both increasing plaque density and appearance in new areas.

Altogether, the present data indicates not only that [ 11 C]PIB-PET is able to detect the presence of Aβ pathology, but also that the intensity of PET signal is associated with more severe pathology stages, which is of high importance regarding the use of Aβ-PET imaging for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic effects in clinical trials.

Interestingly, the associations between neuropathologic measures of Aβ and [ 11 C]PIBPET were not strongly impacted by PET-to-death interval, potentially because of the slow aggregation of Aβ over time. In addition, our sample included a large group of patients with non-AD conditions, who tended to harbor no or minimal Aβ neuropathology and were at a lower risk of developing Aβ pathology within the subsequent years because of their relatively young age. The sample also included a relatively large number of AD patients who may have been near their maximal level of Aβ pathology or may have even started to show decreasing [ 11 C]PIB-PET signal [ 28 , 29 ].

The 0 and 100 CL anchor points are designed to represent the average [ 11 C]PIB-PET binding associated with no Aβ pathology (originally based on a group of young controls), and the typical pathology observed in patients with mild-to-moderate AD dementia. Our autopsy cohort supports the validity of these values, when looking at individuals with no or maximal levels of Aβ neuropathology on CERAD and Thal. Importantly, these patterns were observed with minor variations across centers ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure 3 ), despite heterogeneity in clinical characteristics, scanners and image reconstruction methods.

Our analyses identified a threshold of 12.2 CL to detect moderate-to-frequent CERAD scores with 89% sensitivity and 86% specificity. This threshold also corresponded to the smallest CL value observed among scans that were read as positive by consensus of three independent visual readers. Although the six cases in the 12.2–24.4 CL range were read as positive most (72%) of the time, only 3/6 cases were read as positive by all three raters - compared to 29/30 cases >24.4 CL read as positive by all raters. This indicates that, as expected, early signs of positivity might be less reliably identified by visual read.

Importantly, all “false positive” cases based on the 12.2 CL threshold had some level of Aβ neuropathology (CERAD sparse and Thal phase between 2 and 4, see Figure 2D and Table 3 ), supporting a high degree of tracer specificity: all 115 individuals with CL>12.2 had at least some neuritic plaques at autopsy. However, sensitivity was imperfect, with some individuals showing significant Aβ neuropathology at autopsy and CL<12.2, in line with studies suggesting that low levels of Aβ neuropathology detectable at autopsy are not sufficient to produce a positive PET signal [ 24 ]. Finally, technical considerations such as the suboptimal extraction from a large cortical volume of interest might also limit sensitivity (e.g. early focal binding would be diluted in a global cortical signal extraction); more restricted regional information could help detect earlier and more focal Aβ deposition [ 5 , 21 , 30 , 31 ].

As discussed above, [ 11 C]PIB CL values represent a continuous measure of cortical fibrillary Aβ pathology, and are not directly comparable to neuropathological scales that measure the spatial extent of Aβ deposits (Thal), maximal density of neuritic plaques (CERAD) or integration of Thal and CERAD scales with Braak staging of neurofibrillary tau pathology (ADNC). Nevertheless, such comparisons allow us to anchor CL measurements - and thresholds - to clinically interpretable measures of neuropathology. Our data suggest that the earliest detectable PIB signal occurs at approximately 12 CL, which in our study robustly distinguished CERAD none-sparse vs moderate-frequent scores and Thal phases 2–5 from 0–1. This measurement appeared independent of PET-toautopsy interval, and usually corresponded to positive visual interpretations by blinded readers. That said, CL values of 12 are lower than published PIB-CL thresholds [ 6 , 32 ], and may represent the limit of reliable detection of signal to noise with PIB. This threshold needs to be validated in independent cohorts. In addition, this threshold may not perform as well with 18 F radiotracers [ 9 , 10 ] that show greater variance or “noise” in Aβ-negative individuals because a threshold must account for both the ground-truth of which cases are true-positives as well as the noise inherent in the measure for which the threshold is determined. Even with PIB, higher thresholds may be appropriate in settings in which specificity should be emphasized, such as clinical trial eligibility. A more conservative threshold of 24 CL would be appropriate for identifying clinically meaningful Aβ burden in cognitively impaired patients, as this threshold best discriminated none-low from intermediate-high overall ADNC as well as Thal phases 0–2 from 3–5. Thresholds in between 12–24, such as the threshold of 19 CL derived from a “reliable worsening cut point” technique based on longitudinal [ 11 C]PET-PET data [ 6 ], may represent a reasonable compromise between the more liberal and conservative thresholds presented in this study.

Our study also highlighted a number of potential limitations of applying the standard Centiloid towards processing Aβ-PET imaging. First, although the presence of negative CL values is expected (the average of young controls being 0, half of Aβ-negative individuals should have slightly negative CL values), we observed multiple individuals with values beyond what could be explained by normal variations around 0 CL. The lowest value from the calibrating young control group was −6.8, while we observed 20 participants with lower values ( Figure 1B ). Further analyses of these highly negative individuals ( Supplementary Table 5 ) showed that the vast majority were controls in the older age range or cognitively impaired patients with low or non-AD pathology, suggesting that the very negative CL values might be due to brain atrophy in participants with presumably no specific [ 11 C]PIB binding. This hypothesis is reinforced by the high prevalence of Pick’s disease in this group ( Supplementary Table 5 ), which is usually associated with severe atrophy [ 33 – 35 ]. Our findings highlight that any CL value should be interpreted with caution in individuals with brain atrophy. The implementation of partial volume effect correction methods might be useful in these cases [ 36 – 39 ] although alternative pipelines would have to be validated following Centiloid requirements.

Second, outlier analyses identified two individuals with ADAD with [ 11 C]PIB binding to both cerebral and cerebellar cortices (the latter being included in the reference region in the standard Centiloid pipeline) resulting in subthreshold CL values. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that other reference regions may be preferred while studying ADAD [ 40 – 42 ] due to the higher burden of Aβ pathology [ 43 , 44 ], including amyloid angiopathy [ 45 ], in the cerebellum. Alternative methods proposed by the Centiloid project [ 46 ], for instance using the pons as a reference region, may then be preferred. It is important to note that, over and above those two cases, all 54 individuals at Thal phase 5 had - by definition - some cerebellar Aβ pathology. Yet, the structure (mostly diffuse) and/or low density of these Aβ deposits did not induce sufficient cerebellar [ 11 C]PIB binding to generate false negative CL values.

Finally, it should be highlighted that the current study only included [ 11 C]PIB-PET data and that future studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the Centiloid approach to other radiotracers, and most importantly to combine data acquired using various radiotracers.

In a large cohort encompassing a broad range of clinical and neuropathologic characteristics, we showed the feasibility and robustness of a multi-site CL-based [ 11 C]PIB-PET project and derived pathology-based thresholds for PET positivity. These results contribute to a better understanding of the pathology underlying imaging findings, and should help the field towards better between-laboratory comparability and collaborations.
