Interplay between innate immunity and Alzheimer’s disease: APOE and TREM2 in the spotlight

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is more than a pure proteopathy. Chronic neuroinflammation stands out during the pathogenesis of the disease and in turn modulates disease progression. The central nervous system (CNS) is separated from the blood circulation by the blood-brain barrier. In Alzheimer’s disease, neuroinflammation heavily relies on innate immune responses that are primarily mediated by CNS-resident microglia. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and was recently shown to affect the disease in part through its immunomodulatory function. This function of ApoE is likely linked to triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is expressed by microglia in the CNS. Here, we review the rapidly growing literature on the role of disease-associated microglia, TREM2 and ApoE in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and present an integrated view of innate immune function in Alzheimer’s disease.

## Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. It was first reported by Alois Alzheimer in 1906 in a description of a 51-year-old woman who presented with cognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities 1 . Her autopsy showed brain atrophy with ‘miliary foci’ and characteristic neurofibrillary changes, which represent two distinct pathological hallmarks: extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques consisting predominantly of amyloid-β [G] peptides, and intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles comprising aggregated, hyperphosphorylated tau [G] protein. Alzheimer’s disease pathology begins decades prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Extensive biomarker and imaging studies indicate that amyloid-β aggregation is the earliest pathological event in Alzheimer’s disease, followed at a later stage by pathological changes of tau aggregation extending beyond the limbic system to the neocortex, which correlates with brain atrophy and cognitive decline 2 , 3 . The amyloid hypothesis poses that amyloid-β accumulation initiates a cascade of downstream pathological events and drives Alzheimer’s disease progression 4 . Although Alzheimer’s disease was initially considered a cell autonomous neurodegenerative disorder, marked neuroinflammation is observed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, alongside amyloid-β and tau pathology. Accumulating genetic and functional evidence strongly indicate an active role of brain innate immunity in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and disease progression. In this Review, we summarize the exciting research progress in understanding the roles of innate immunity in Alzheimer’s disease. We first highlight the significance of the innate immune system in Alzheimer’s disease by describing their genetic linkage. We then discuss the current understanding of how brain innate immunity affects Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, with a particular focus on the microglia-apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) axis.

## Linking the innate immune system to Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is divided into two main categories. A small percentage (<1%) of Alzheimer’s disease is inherited within families in an autosomal-dominant fashion that manifests with early dementia onset, typically between age 30 and 60. This form of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in genes affecting amyloid-β production, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio [G] , or amyloid-β structure, such as amyloid precursor protein ( APP ), presenilin-1(PSEN/) and presenilin-2 ( PSEN2) 5 . Over 99% of Alzheimer’s disease cases occur later in life, typically in people over 65 years old, and are referred to as ‘late-onset’ Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). While there is no identified ‘cause’ for LOAD, the two most important risk factors are age and genetics. To date, more than 30 Alzheimer’s disease-risk loci have been identified via a combination of genetic linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) studies 6 . Of these risk loci, over 50% of gene variants validated by functional genomics are implicated in microglial and innate immune cell function, including the top two risk genes, APOE and TREM2 . In addition, epigenomic analysis has shown that Alzheimer’s disease GWAS loci are preferentially enriched in enhancer sequences implicated in innate immune processes 7 . These findings indicate an essential role of the innate immune response in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Major Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk factors and their linkage to innate immune functions are shown in Box 1 – Box 3 .

Chronic glial activation is a prominent feature accompanying pathological protein accumulation in the Alzheimer’s disease brain. Prolonged neuroinflammation may induce neuronal injury and death via multiple ways. First, activated glia produce toxic substances such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) that can directly damage or kill neurons; second, inflammatory stress and sub-lethal pathological insults can induce stressed-but-viable neurons to expose reversible ‘eat-me’ signals such as phosphatidylserine or calreticulin, causing the neurons to be phagocytosed and killed by activated microglia via a process called phagoptosis 8 ; third, activation of the complement system promotes membrane attack complexes (MAC) formation, creating pores on cell membranes to induce cell lysis; fourth, activated microglia can crosstalk with astrocytes, inducing reactive astrocytes to rapidly kill neurons via secreted neurotoxic factors and loss of neurotrophic function 9 , and fifth, neuronal NLRP1 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 1) inflammasome and caspase-1 activation in Alzheimer’s disease can induce neuronal injury and death 10 , 11 . In addition to a direct effect on neuronal viability, innate immunity also affects amyloid-β and tau pathology buildup, which in turn can influence neurodegeneration. Therefore, innate immunity is an indispensable component in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and may constitute a driving force for disease progression.

As the principle immune cell type in the brain, microglia play a key role in mediating brain innate immunity. Microglial cell function in the pathogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease will be discussed in the following sections.

## Microglia biology
Microglia are the macrophages of the brain and play central roles in neuroinflammation. They are derived from embryonic yolk sac (YS) precursors and maintain their CNS population via local self-renewal, with little contribution from bone marrow-derived monocytes 12 , 13 . They retain many features of macrophages, but also adapt themselves to meet specific requirements of the neural tissue. During development, microglia prune complement-tagged immature synapses 14 , 15 , eliminate redundant neural precursor cells 16 , and promote developmental neuronal apoptosis along with removal of cell corpses 17 , 18 . In the adult brain, highly dynamic microglia processes constantly survey the local environment 19 , 20 in a speed estimated to cover the entire parenchyma within a few hours 20 . Comprehensive signaling components, including major classes of neurotransmitter receptors, pattern recognition receptors, cytokine and chemokine receptors, as well as other receptor systems, converge on microglia 21 , making them a superior sensor and reactor to environmental cues. This grants microglia the capacity to monitor neuronal activity and modulate synaptic plasticity 22 . During stresses, such as brain injury, infection, or neuropathological diseases, microglia are activated in an effort to combat the insult and control damage. However, in this instance, both protective and detrimental effects can occur.

The signal transduction pathways for microglial cell activation have been well documented ( Box 4 ). Initial characterization of microglial cell polarization into pro-inflammatory ‘M1’ and reparative ‘M2’ phenotypes was based on the M1/M2 macrophage classification. 23 Macrophages acquire an M1 phenotype in response to interferon γ (IFNγ) and synthesize toxic substances, such ROS, NO, and lysosomal enzymes to kill microbes. By contrast, M2 macrophages are induced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) and express enzymes for collagen synthesis and fibrosis to promote tissue repair. Likewise, activated microglia are divided into an Ml phenotype, characterized by upregulation of inflammatory genes such as TNF and IL1β , and an M2 phenotype, characterized by the expression of pro-repair genes such as arginase 1 ( Arg1 ) and chitinase-like 3 ( Chi3l3 , also known as Ym1 ) 24 . However, this nomenclature is now deemed inaccurate as accumulating evidence has revealed a broad diversity of macrophage activation statuses and shown that macrophages show remarkable plasticity to change phenotypes in response to environmental cues 25 , 26 .

In neurodegenerative diseases, the precise gene signatures of microglia that mediate pathology-and neurodegeneration-associated sterile inflammation have not been clearly elucidated. Recent single-cell RNA-seq data identified a two-stage microglial cell activation process that occurs during disease progression in an amyloid-β-depositing mouse model, where the transition from the first to the second stage is determined by TREM2 27 . The end-stage activated microglia appear to display a conserved core-expression profile harbouring certain degrees of diversity across individual disease phenotypes 27 , 28 . The core expression profile is likely induced by neuronal cell death or damage, whereas distinct pathologies may contribute to the diversity. The common disease-associated microglial cell signature was defined by different groups as the ‘microglial neurodegenerative’ (MGnD) phenotype 28 or the ‘disease-associated microglia’ (DAM) phenotype 27 . This signature is characterized by a suppression of microglial homeostatic genes, and an induction of pro-inflammatory genes as well as genes involved in microglial phagocytotic function targeting degenerated/injured neurons and amyloid plaques 27 , 28 . The MGnD phenotype can largely be recapitulated by injecting apoptotic neurons into mouse brain parenchyma, where the subset of microglia that are activated to phagocytose apoptotic neurons show a similar molecular phenotype to the MGnD phenotype 28 . The MGnD microglia can also be activated via intracerebral administration of kainic acid [G] that induces neuronal cell death 28 , supporting the idea that neuronal death and damage determines the central microglial cell gene signature in neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, although the microglia that phagocytose apoptotic neurons share many molecular signatures with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFNγ-stimulated M1 microglia, they also exhibit significant differences, such as contrasting gene expression patterns of secreted phosphoprotein 1( Ssp1 ), CC-chemokine ligand 3 ( Ccl3 ), and early growth response 1( Egr1 ). But the most distinguishing difference is that the expression of Apoe — the hallmark gene of the MGnD phenotype that has been found to be upregulated in microglia in all currently-assessed neurodegenerative diseases — is suppressed in M1 microglia. In addition, certain classical M2 microglial cell markers, such as Arg1 and Ym1 , are also induced in microglia that phagocytose apoptotic neurons, indicating a unique microglial activation profile in neurodegenerative diseases that is distinct from the M1/M2 classification 28 ( Table 1 ).

## Microglia and amyloid-β pathology
Numerous studies have examined the effect of neuroinflammation on amyloid-β pathogenesis by targeting cytokines and other inflammatory molecules to create either a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory environment in the brain. The results of these studies have been inconsistent. Several studies have found that activating pro-inflammatory pathways — for example, by overexpressing TNF 29 , IFNγ 30 or IL-6 31 , or by inhibiting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 32 — reduces plaque deposition, and vice versa 33 , 34 . These effects have been proposed to mainly result from enhanced phagocytotic activity of microglia induced by potent inflammation, leading to greater amyloid-β clearance, whereas APP synthesis or processing is not affected. However, other studies have suggested that inhibition of inflammation attenuates amyloid-β pathology 35 – 37 . Although these studies in which brain inflammation is manipulated featuring conventional M1 or M2 microglial cell phenotypes provide important insights, it is likely that they do not truly reflect the disease-associated inflammatory signatures found in neurodegenerative diseases.

Microglia have long been hypothesized to regulate amyloid-β pathogenesis via phagocytosis. However, depleting microglia after amyloid-β pathology onset via pharmacological inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signalling 38 or by using the CD11b-HSVTK (TK) system 39 for 4 weeks, does not affect total plaque burden. In contrast, a recent study shows that a three-month depletion of microglia via CSF1R inhibition starting prior to amyloid-β pathology onset drastically reduces plaque deposition in 5XFAD mice [G] 40 . This indicates that microglia may be involved in the initial seeding stage of plaque formation. Interestingly, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cultured microglia leads to the release of ASC specks that rapidly bind to and cross-seed amyloid-β to promote amyloid-β aggregation 41 . In the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and amyloid-β depositing mice, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated and ASC specs are found to present in the core of amyloid plaques 41 , indicating an active role of ASC specs in plaque seeding and initiation. ASC-deficient APP Swe PSEN1 dE9 mice [G] have significantly reduced cerebral plaque loads, and show little seeding and spreading of amyloid-β pathology when receiving cerebral injection of brain homogenates containing amyloid-β seeds 41 . Consistent with this, two-photon live imaging of GFP-labelled microglia in 5XFAD mice show that microglia activated by laser-induced cerebral injury migrate to the damaged sites and induce de novo plaque formation in the injured site within two weeks 42 . This emerging evidence suggests that activated microglia may facilitate amyloid-β plaque formation by promoting amyloid-β seeding in the initiation stage. However, more research is needed to verify this effect and to exclude potential artefacts caused by specific animal models or off-target drug properties.

Despite the fact that no notable changes in global plaque loads have been observed when microglia are deleted after pathology onset, genetic evidence from TREM2 studies indicate a role of microglia in regulating amyloid-β pathology post plaque formation. Microglia have long been observed to cluster around amyloid-β plaques in postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brains and in mouse models of amyloid-β deposition. Unlike non-plaque-associated microglia, which retain a more homeostatic phenotype 27 , 43 , plaque-associated microglia show major alterations in their molecular signatures and constitute the population of DAM in amyloid-β-depositing mouse models 27 . TREM2 was recently demonstrated to be essential for promoting microglial cell association with plaques 44 – 49 . TREM2 haplodeficiency, ablation, or the TREM2 R47H mutation that causes a missense variant of TREM2, eads to a significant reduction of plaque-associated microglia compared to their TREM2-sufficient counterparts 44 – 49 . Corresponding to loss of microglial enclosure around plaques, TREM2-deficient amyloid-β depositing mice develop significantly enlarged and less compact plaques containing longer and more diffuse star-shaped amyloid fibrils that project from loosely packed cores 48 , 49 . Such morphological changes in plaques are frequently associated with a greater degree of neuritic dystrophy with enlarged, swollen axons and dendrites in close vicinity 48 , 49 , indicating that plaque-associated microglia perform plaque trimming and compacting functions that help to restrict plaque growth, and that these cells serve as a barrier to limit plaque-induced neuronal toxicity. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease who carry the TREM2 R47H mutation show patterns of plaque morphology and neurite dystrophy that resemble the plaques observed in TREM2-deficient amyloid-β depositing mice 49 , indicating that this mutation causes a loss of function.

In terms of the mechanistic basis of these observations, TREM2 was recently identified as an amyloid-β receptor with a higher affinity for amyloid-β oligomers than monomers 50 . Notably, TREM2 expression is specifically upregulated in plaque-associated microglia in both mice and humans 27 , 45 . Keren-Shaul et al. showed that TREM2 expression switches on the late-stage DAM signature featuring an enhanced phagocytotic activity 51 , suggesting that plaque-associated microglia may be able to phagocytose plaques. Supporting this idea, plaque-associated microglia have been shown to contain plaque-derived materials 27 , 49 , indicating their capability to phagocytose plaque components. This plaque-phagocytotic capacity is impaired with TREM2 deficiency 48 , 49 , indicating that plaque-associated microglia trim and compress plaques via TREM2-dependent plaque phagocytosis.

Initial studies on TREM2 reported contradicting results regarding the effect of TREM2-deficiency on plaque loads 45 , 46 , which was subsequently identified to be a disease progression-dependent effect 47 . Overall, TREM2 deficiency leads to a mild reduction of plaque deposition in early-stage disease, but causes enhanced amyloid-β pathology in advanced stages of the disease 45 – 47 . This disease-stage-dependent effect was initially confusing. However, new insights into microglial cell functions suggest a possible explanation. Given the role of activated microglia in promoting amyloid-β seeding, reduced microglial association with the initial plaque seeds due to TREM2 deficiency may impede the seeding efficiency, leading to a prolonged lag phase and therefore reducing pathology in the early stage. In addition, TREM2 −/− amyloid-β depositing mice consistently show downregulation of inflammatory genes, such as Tnf and Il1b 45 – 47 , and also of key genes associated with the MGnD phenotype, such as c-type lectin domain family 7 member A ( Clec7a ) and integrin subunit alpha X ( Itgax ) 27 , 28 , indicating immature polarization of microglia into the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype and insufficient microglial activation. Such incompletely activated microglia may fail to produce sufficient inflammatory factors 43 , such as ASCs, to effectively initiate plaque seeding.

By contrast, during the advanced disease stage plaques are already formed, hence seeding efficiency is no longer a determining factor. Instead, microglial plaque-trimming function becomes a dominating factor influencing plaque growth. Lack of TREM2 results in impaired plaque trimming, which leads to enlarged plaques with reduced compaction 48 , 49 . The increased plaque size may be the primary cause of the enhanced amyloid-β pathology observed in late-stage disease in TREM2 −/− amyloid-β depositing mice revealed by amyloid-β antibody staining. Supporting this notion, fibrillar plaque staining indicated no difference in the total amount of pathology between TREM2 +/+ and TREM2 −/− amyloid-β depositing mice at the late stage of disease 47 .

Interestingly, a recent study showed that expressing human TREM2 under the endogenous human regulatory elements on top of murine TREM2 in 5XFAD mice leads to reduced fibrillar amyloid-β deposition with denser cores, accompanied by ameliorated neuritic dystrophy 52 . Surprisingly, plaque-associated microglia drop in number with TREM2 overexpression and exhibit elongated and ramified processes with a sharp reduction of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) [G] signal, indicating an altered activation status, likely reflecting less activation 52 . These effects are interpreted to derive from enhanced microglial phagocytotic capacity induced by TREM2 overexpression which requires less microglial activation to trim plaques. Transcription analysis from crude cortical lysates reveals mixed microglial activation patterns with suppression of certain DAM genes, but further activation of other DAM genes that appear to favour phagocytosis 52 . These gene signatures need to be verified in isolated microglia in future studies and the human TREM2 overexpression effect would need to be confirmed in a murine TREM2 −/− background to avoid potential confounding effects.

## Microglia and tau pathology
In the brain, tau is primarily an intracellular neuronal protein, but is normally secreted into the interstitial fluid (ISF) 53 and is believed to transmit tau pathology in a prion-like manner 54 . High-molecular-weight phosphorylated tau is found in the ISF, and is proposed to be the species mediating tau propagation 55 . Insoluble tau isolated from postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brain is shown to be taken up by microglia in vitro and in vivo 56 . In a tau-spreading mouse model where human P301L tau was focally expressed in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) layer II/III neurons, microglial cell depletion markedly suppressed tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus by inhibiting microglial secretion of exosomes that contain tau oligomers for seeding 57 , indicating microglia may actively participate in tau spreading by taking in and subsequently releasing some form of tau.

Others assessed the effect of microglial activation on tau pathogenesis. Microglial activation is shown to precede tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model 58 , and administering an immunosuppressant drug FK506 from an early age drastically reduces tau pathology, neurodegeneration and mortality 58 . In addition, chronic intraperitoneal administration of LPS to 3xTg-AD mice [G] for 6-weeks is shown to induce marked microglial activation and promote site-specific tau hyperphosphorylation 59 . IL-1 receptor signalling is found to play a key role in neuroinflammation-induced tau phosphorylation by enhancing the activity of tau kinases including cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5/p25 (CDK5/p25), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) 60 , 61 . Importantly, deleting the microglial cell-expressed homeostatic gene CX3C chemokine receptor 1( Cx3cr1 ) in htau mice [G] leads to amplified microglial activation and enhanced tau hyperphosphorylation/aggregation 62 , 63 ; whereas overexpressing a soluble form of CX 3 CL1, the ligand for CX 3 CR1, reduces microglial cell activation and tau pathology in rTg4510 mice [G] 64 . Interestingly, there also appears to be a disease-stage-dependent microglial effect on tau pathology. CX 3 CR1-induced differences in tau phosphorylation are only observed in early to middle disease stages 62 – 64 , but is largely absent in late-disease stage, when an overall reduction of phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) signal occurs 58 , 63 , likely due to loss of neurons from neurodegeneration. Similarly, TREM2 deficiency is reported to enhance tau hyperphosphorylation at an early disease stage in htau mice 65 and a mid-disease stage in P301S mice [G] 66 , but does not affect tau pathology at a late-disease stage in P301S mice 67 , whereas overexpressing murine TREM2 in microglia is found to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in the mid-disease stage in P301S mice 68 .

## Microglia and neurodegeneration
Apart from regulating Alzheimer’s disease pathologies, microglia likely play a more crucial role in modulating neurodegeneration. This capacity is partially attributed to their pathology-modulating functions, as greater pathology may cause more neuronal injury and death. However, end-stage MGnD microglia that harbour high phagocytotic and inflammatory capacity may directly kill stressed neurons, such as tau-loaded neurons, via phagoptosis; or damage and kill healthy neurons by secreting neurotoxic substances, independent of their effects on Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Interestingly, microglia are shown to intimately associate with tau-loaded neurons in human brain tissue 56 . End-stage TREM2 −/− P301S mice that exhibit significantly reduced microgliosis and downregulated MGnD genes such as ApoE and cystatin 7 ( Cst7 ), show significantly attenuated brain atrophy compared to TREM2 +/+ P301S mice despite no change of tau pathology 67 . Similarly, overexpression of soluble CX 3 CL1 reduces microglial activation and neuronal loss in rTg4510 mice 64 . The same principle also applies to other neurodegenerative diseases. In mouse models of Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), CX3CR1 ablation leads to marked microglial activation and loss of dopaminergic or motor neurons compared to CX 3 CR1 +/+ mice. Hence, activated microglia actively modulate neurodegeneration.

In addition to showing a direct impact, microglia also indirectly regulate neurodegeneration by communicating with astrocytes, another major CNS cell type constituting approximately 30% of CNS cells. Unlike microglia that are derived from yolk sac precursors, astrocytes resemble neurons in that they originate from ectodermal precursors and are not conventional immune cells. However, astrocytes are immune-competent. They respond to a wide range of brain insults and are activated in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease 9 , 69 – 71 . In physiological conditions, astrocytes provide essential nutritional and growth support to neurons to maintain their survival and function. They regulate extracellular ion and neurotransmitter concentrations and likely modulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity 72 . In addition, astrocytes actively regulate synaptic pruning during development 73 , 74 and in adulthood 74 , 75 to maintain synaptic homeostasis and neuronal circuit function. They also form the glia limitans that serves as a critical barrier separating neural and non-neural tissue along perivascular spaces, meninges, and tissue lesions in the CNS to maintain brain homeostasis 76 .

Astrocytes are highly heterogeneous populations that differ in a variety of dimensions including morphology, function, developmental origin, and activation profiles 72 . A recent study identified two distinct populations of reactive astrocytes induced by inflammation or ischemia, termed as A1 astrocytes and A2 astrocytes, respectively 77 . A1 astrocytes strongly upregulate genes involved in classical complement activation which are shown to be destructive to synapses, therefore are considered harmful; whereas A2 astrocytes upregulate neurotrophic genes that promote neuronal survival and growth, and are deemed protective 77 . Interestingly, LPS-induced inflammatory microglia are found to activate A1 astrocytes by producing a collection of molecules: TNF, IL-1α and complement 1q (C1Q) 9 . A1 astrocytes demonstrate strong neurotoxicity by secreting toxic factors that can rapidly induce neuronal death, and by losing normal functions to support neuronal survival, growth or functionality and to maintain environmental homeostasis 9 . Complement 3 (C3), a secreted marker for A1 astrocytes, is found to signal through the C3a receptor (C3aR) expressed on neurons to disrupt neuronal morphology and function 78 . In APP-transgenic mice, blocking A1 astrocyte activation rescues cognitive impairment 78 . A1 astrocytes are found in post-mortem brain tissues from a broad panel of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and multiple sclerosis 9 , indicating a common mechanism through which these reactive astrocytes affect neurodegeneration.

Interestingly, activated A1 astrocytes are shown to signal back to microglia by binding to microglial C3aR to regulate microglial function 79 . In vitro, acute C3/C3a activation promotes, whereas chronic C3/C3a treatment reduces microglial phagocytosis. In vivo, C3 elevation via NF-κB hyperactivation significantly exacerbates amyloid-β pathology and neuroinflammation in APP-transgenic mice, whereas treatment with a C3aR antagonist ameliorates plaque load and microgliosis 79 . Microglia-astrocyte crosstalk is essential for the immune regulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and neurodegeneration, and should be further explored in future studies.

## Other innate immune cells in Alzheimer’s disease
Three additional CNS macrophage cell types other than classical microglia, namely perivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus macrophages, are present at the interface between the parenchyma and the circulation. Perivascular and meningeal macrophages are generated from yolk sac precursors and are maintained by self-renewal, whereas choroid plexus macrophages have dual embryonic and adult hematopoietic origins 80 . These macrophages express high levels of CD45 and MHCII as opposed to low expression of these markers in parenchymal microglia 80 , and are speculated to play a role in CNS surveillance and parenchyma-peripheral immune connection, but their functions are still not clear. The role of potential-infiltrating monocytes in affecting amyloid-β pathology is assessed in a microglia-repopulation model, where depleting microglia using the CD11b-HSVTK (TK) system is followed by a rapid repopulation by peripherally derived myeloid cells in the absence of additional stimuli such as irradiation 81 . Monocyte repopulation for up to 6 months does not modify amyloid load 82 , 83 , indicating peripheral monocytes may have no additional effects on parenchymal amyloid-β pathology. However, patrolling monocytes are reported to be actively involved in vascular amyloid-β clearance 84 . Others report that neutrophils infiltrate brain parenchyma of amyloid-β depositing mouse models and human Alzheimer’s disease brain, and migrate towards amyloid-β plaques 85 , 86 . Neutrophil infiltration is shown to exacerbate tau phosphorylation, microgliosis, and behavioral deficits in 3xTg-AD mice that develop both amyloid-β and tau pathology 86 .

## Overview of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease can be beneficial or detrimental depending on disease stages and targets of activated microglia. There appear to be three major disease stages during the course of Alzheimer’s disease ( FIG. 1 ). The early stage ( FIG. 1a ) features plaque initiation, when microglial activation appears to facilitate plaque formation via secreting inflammatory factors, therefore inflammation at this stage may be harmful. It’s unclear why microglia may have evolved to promote amyloid-β seeding during the plaque initiation stage. While amyloid-β deposition is likely an incidental event as a price paid for aging beyond active evolutionary selection, one perspective holds that amyloid-β peptides act as antimicrobial molecules that bind to and trap invading pathogens via oligomerization to inhibit their binding to host cells 87 . Hence, enhanced seeding may expedite pathogen insulation. Although intriguing, this theory needs more evidence to support. The mid-stage ( FIG. 1b ) is characterized by plaque accumulation, during which time activated microglia target growing plaques to restrict their expansion and toxicity to neighboring neurons, hence playing a protective role. The late stage ( FIG. 1c ) is represented by accumulating tau pathology with plateaued amyloid-β pathology. During this time, cell death increases and MGnD microglia are primarily involved in removal of dead neurons and targeting stressed-but-viable neurons injured by tau pathology for phagoptosis. Activated microglia may also exacerbate tau pathology by activating tau kinases and enhancing tau spreading. Meanwhile, they may generate ROS and NO and induce A1 astrocytes to aggravate neuronal loss. The massive neuronal death may further exacerbate neuroinflammation to kill more neurons, forming a vicious circle. This stage may be similar in all neurodegenerative diseases, and detrimental neuroinflammation during this stage may constitute a major mechanism for neurodegeneration across different diseases.

## Where does ApoE fit in the picture?
ApoE as an apolipoprotein forms lipoprotein particles with lipids and cholesterol to mediate their transport. It delivers lipids and cholesterols to cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins and also mediates cellular cholesterol efflux in a process called reverse cholesterol transport, where cellular cholesterol is transferred to the lipoprotein via ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) 88 , 89 . ApoE is most highly expressed in the liver and the CNS. In the brain, ApoE is the most abundantly produced apolipoprotein, and is synthesized primarily by astrocytes and to a lesser extent by microglia 90 , 91 .

APOE is by far the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The ε4 allele is significantly enriched in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and ε4-carrying patients show earlier disease onset 92 , heavier amyloid-β plaque load in the brain 93 , greater brain atrophy 94 , and accelerated disease progression 69 compared to patients who do not carry this allele. The prominent effect of ApoE on Alzheimer’s disease triggered broad enthusiasm in understanding how ApoE contributes to Alzheimer’s disease. As ApoE was initially identified as an amyloid-β-binding protein 95 , extensive follow-up studies have focused on its relationship with amyloid-β pathology. To date, substantial evidence has demonstrated ApoE affects amyloid-β deposition in a dosage and isoform-specific fashion (ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2) 96 – 100 , and we recently reported that ApoE4 exacerbated tau pathogenesis and tau-mediated neurodegeneration relative to other ApoE isoforms independent of amyloid-β 69 . Mechanistically, ApoE isoform-dependent effects on ApoE-amyloid-β interaction, amyloid-β aggregation, and amyloid-β clearance have been comprehensively investigated 101 , and ApoE isoform-dependent interaction with tau is also reported 102 , 103 . Interestingly, ApoE effects do not appear to be restricted to Alzheimer’s disease. APOE4 has also been reported to be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia 104 , pure synucleinopathies including pure dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia 105 , although the data in these instances is less clear. Notably, genetic ablation of ApoE in various neurodegenerative mouse models — including tauopathy 69 , synucleinopathy 106 , and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 107 — shows a similar protective effect against neurodegeneration and disease severity, indicating a prevalent function of ApoE in neurodegenerative conditions based on a potential common mechanism in addition to its specific effects in individual pathologies. We think this shared mechanism is likely linked to ApoE’s immunomodulatory function, as we discuss below.

In fact, the capacity of ApoE to modulate inflammation has long been observed. In healthy humans challenged with intravenous LPS infusion, ε4-carriers demonstrate significantly higher elevation of body temperature and plasma TNF levels compared to ε4 non-carriers 108 . Similarly, when whole blood isolates from human subjects were stimulated ex vivo with TLR ligands, enhanced production of a wide panel of cytokines and chemokines was observed in blood from ε4 + donors compared with ε4 − donors 108 . A greater immune response associated with the ε4 allele is also observed in human ApoE-targeted replacement (APOE-TR) mice [G] and in cultured microglia/macrophages upon LPS stimulation 108 – 110 .

How ApoE achieves this is not well understood. Evidence shows that lipid rafts play an essential role in immune activation by serving as platforms for signalling complex assembly; hence minor intervention on membrane lipids such as cholesterol loading or efflux is sufficient to induce membrane remodelling and subsequent signal transduction 111 . Higher retention of cholesterol in lipid rafts due to lack of the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 or ABCG1, enhances TLR signalling in macrophages 111 and induces leukocytosis under hypercholesterolemia conditions 112 , whereas myeloid cell surface-bound ApoE promotes cholesterol efflux in a cell-autonomous fashion to inhibit myelopoiesis 113 . ApoE4 is reported to be less effective than ApoE3 in inducing cholesterol efflux from macrophages 114 , which causes cholesterol accumulation on cell membranes 108 , 114 . This mechanism has been proposed to explain the higher immune reactivity associated with ApoE4. Supporting this theory, ApoE-deficient mice behave similarly to ApoE4-targeted replacement (ApoE4-TR) mice (mice with the human APOE4 coding sequence replacing the murine apoe coding sequence) in response to intracerebroventricular LPS stimulation with enhanced gliosis and cytokine production compared with ApoE2-TR and ApoE3-TR mice 110 . However, this study is based on LPS stimulation, which has key differences from neurodegeneration-associated sterile neuroinflammation. Above all differences, the lack of ApoE induction may determine the distinct nature of the response.

## Immune functions of ApoE in neurodegeneration
Contrary to LPS treatment where ApoE deletion amplifies the immune response, under neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory conditions, ApoE deficiency attenuates inflammation 28 , 69 , 97 , 107 and disease severity 69 , 106 , 107 . In a tauopathy mouse model, genetic ablation of ApoE markedly reduces activation of microglia and astrocytes activation and ameliorates brain atrophy 69 . In a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease featuring synucleinopathy, ApoE deletion significantly attenuates the loss of spinal cord motor neurons, delays disease onset, and improves survival 106 . ApoE ablation in EAE mice also reduces inflammation and disease severity 107 .

How can one explain this apparent contradiction? Interestingly, in EAE, the disease-exacerbating effect of ApoE only occurs in the effector phase 107 when recruited effector immune cells, primarily macrophages, are activated by helper T cells and start to attack and ingest myelin. In the initiation stage, however, T cell priming by myelin antigens is enhanced in ApoE-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice 107 . These results indicate multi-faceted immunomodulatory functions of ApoE. ApoE may reduce the excitability of immune cells by modulating lipid raft content on cell membranes, but may also be required for intact functionality of MGnD microglia. ApoE deletion prevents full acquisition of the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype with suppression of key MGnD genes 28 , and therefore may prohibit disease-associated microglia from being fully developed to carry out their pro-inflammatory and phagocytotic functions. In addition, as neurons express a number of ApoE receptors, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on cell membranes, we propose that ApoE may accumulate on the surfaces of damaged and dead neurons as a result of impaired neuronal uptake function, and serve as an opsonin to promote neuronal phagocytosis by microglia. The opsonization effect may be achieved via ApoE interacting with TREM2 on microglia, as TREM2 has been demonstrated to be an ApoE receptor 116 – 119 . Supporting this hypothesis, ApoE binding to cell surface was shown to be significantly enhanced in apoptotic N2a cells, a murine neuroblastoma cell line, compared to healthy cells, and cultured microglia phagocytose significantly more apoptotic N2a cells with increased levels of ApoE in the medium 116 . TREM2 −/− microglia, in contrast, show impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic N2a cells, supporting an ApoE-TREM2 axis in mediating microglial phagocytotic function.

Hence, despite higher excitability of microglia in the absence of ApoE, their impaired neurodegenerative functionality may hinder their capacity to kill and damage neurons via phagoptosis or inflammatory mechanisms, which may underlie the protective effect of ApoE deficiency in various neurodegenerative settings. Supporting this view, global or conditional deletion of ApoE in microglia reduces neuronal loss in the facial motor nucleus after facial nerve axotomy 28 . Interestingly, TREM2 shares the same pathways with ApoE in regulating the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype. TREM2 deletion in APPPS1–21 [G] or superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice [G] results in ApoE downregulation and a similar suppression of core inflammatory MGnD genes and restoration of homeostatic genes 28 . Targeting TREM2 signaling in the facial nerve axotomy model ameliorates neuronal loss 28 , and ablation of TREM2 in tauopathy mice attenuates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration 67 , similar to the effect of ApoE deletion. Whether ApoE isoform-specifically regulates MGnD microglia activation or potential opsonization for neuronal phagocytosis are intriguing questions to be further investigated in future studies.

## ApoE and Alzheimer’s disease pathologies
ApoE has long been observed to affect amyloid-β pathogenesis. Compared with other ApoE isoforms, ApoE4 exacerbates the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain 98 – 100 . Furthermore, regardless of ApoE isoforms, ablating one allele or both alleles of ApoE all lead to reduction of fibrillar amyloid-β deposits 96 , 97 , 120 . These effects were attributed to ApoE affecting amyloid-β fibrillization and clearance 101 . However, recent data suggest new mechanisms of ApoE function. ApoE was found to be essential for plaque formation during the initial seeding stage 121 , 122 . Targeting ApoE4 with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) from birth reduces amyloid-β plaque deposition, whereas ASO treatment after pathology onset in adult mice does not affect fibrillar plaque load 121 . Vice versa, induction of ApoE4 expression during the initial seeding stage, but not during the plaque growing phase, increases amyloid-β pathology 122 . However, although no change in fibrillar plaques was observed in adult ASO-treated mice when X-34 staining (which stains for bona fide fibrillary beta-sheet structures) was used, staining by amyloid-β antibodies revealed significantly increased plaque sizes 121 . Interestingly, ApoE ablation in APP Swe PSEN1 dE9 [G] or APPPS1–21 [G] mice also results in enlarged plaques with wispy fibre-like structures projecting from loosely packed cores 120 , similar to the plaques observed in TREM2-deficient amyloid-β-depositing mice 48 , 49 . Corresponding to loose and enlarged plaques, ApoE deletion leads to impaired microglial cell response to plaques 120 , the same phenotype observed with TREM2 deficiency 44 , 46 . These findings indicate that the ApoE-TREM2 axis implicated in neurodegeneration may share similar mechanisms in regulating microglial cell responses to amyloid-β pathology.

Microglia-mediated compaction and insulation of amyloid-β plaques may require phagocytotic MGnD microglia activation that is dependent on ApoE, and the abundance of ApoE in amyloid plaques 123 , 124 may also play an important role in opsonizing plaques for targeting by activated microglia. In addition, microglia are found to present in the core of ApoE-labelled senile plaques in areas of ApoE-like immunoreactivity 91 , suggesting microglial cell targeting amyloid-β seeds to promote plaque seeding during the plaque initiation stage may also involve ApoE participation as an opsonin to enhance microglia-plaque interaction. The ApoE-TREM2-microglia connection is strongly supported by the observation that the presence of ApoE, TREM2, or microglia similarly enhances amyloidogenesis during the early amyloid-depositing stage, and that ApoE and TREM2 deficiency share the same plaque phenotype mediated by impaired microglial cell function at the late amyloid-depositing stage. Of note, ApoE4 is associated with higher microglial cell reactivity around amyloid-β plaques than ApoE3 in deep cortical layers 125 . The effect of ApoE isoforms on plaque deposition may be related to their different capacities in mediating microglial cell activation and opsonization, in addition to direct isoform-dependent effects on amyloid-β aggregation or clearance.

Early studies showed that ApoE3, but not ApoE4, avidly binds to human tau in vitro 102 , 103 , indicating a potential link between ApoE and tau. ApoE is normally produced by glia and is secreted into the extracellular space, but rare ApoE immunoreactivity is also observed in neuronal cell bodies in brain tissues of Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathy patients 123 , 126 , 127 . Specific overexpression of human ApoE4 in neurons, but not astrocytes, increases tau phosphorylation in mouse brains compared to ApoE3 overexpression 128 , 129 . In addition, amyloid-β pathology is reported to induce higher levels of endogenous murine tau phosphorylation in ApoE4 amyloid-β depositing mice compared to their ApoE3 counterparts 130 . We recently found that human ApoE4 expressed under the endogenous murine ApoE promoter exacerbates tau pathology compared to other ApoE isoforms in a tauopathy mouse model independent of amyloid-β pathology 69 . However, the key point is that in addition to affecting tau pathology, ApoE also potently modulates neurodegeneration in the setting of tauopathy. ApoE4 significantly exacerbates neurodegeneration whereas ApoE ablation strongly attenuates the damage compared to the presence of ApoE regardless of ApoE isoforms 69 . While ApoE may directly regulate tau pathogenesis and affect neurodegeneration via tau-induced cell-autonomous neuronal toxicity, we think the effects of ApoE on both tau pathology and neurodegeneration at least partially fit in the broader picture of the immunomodulatory function of ApoE. The specific lipid composition of ApoE4 lipoprotein may affect lipid raft structures on microglial cell membranes and induce a stronger MGnD phenotype that exacerbates ptau pathogenesis and neurodegeneration. It may also make ApoE4 a more competent opsonin to potentiate neuronal loss via enhanced phagoptosis. In contrast, failure to acquire a complete MGnD phenotype and loss of ApoE opsonization in the absence of ApoE may underlie its protective effect in tauopathy.

An integrated view of ApoE function in Alzheimer’s disease is summarized in FIG. 2 .

## Concluding remarks and future directions
Substantial genetic and functional evidence point to a central role of innate immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease, neuroinflammation plays different roles depending on disease stages. Activated microglia appear to accelerate amyloid plaque formation during the plaque initiation stage, but serve to restrain plaque growth and plaque-associated neuronal damage during the plaque deposition phase. In the late-disease stage when pathological tau accumulates and neuronal death increases, activated microglia exacerbate tau pathology and may serve as a major driving force for neurodegeneration. Targeting neuroinflammation may be an effective therapeutic approach to intervene with disease progression, but therapeutic designs should take into account the disease stage to target the appropriate pathophysiology.

ApoE affects Alzheimer’s disease risk in large part due to its effects on amyloid-β seeding and clearance; it is also a core immune regulator that may influences Alzheimer’s disease through its immunomodulatory functions. The shared features between ApoE and TREM2 suggest an ApoE-TREM2 axis linking ApoE to microglial function. Deeper characterization of disease-associated microglia signatures and functions will be key to understanding the role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in disease. Further investigation connecting ApoE-dependent lipid metabolism with microglia profiling will provide crucial insights into mechanisms underlying ApoE immunomodulatory functions.

Despite all the exciting findings deciphering roles of neuroinflammation in disease pathogenesis and progression with mechanistic and therapeutic implications, the fundamental problem is not solved. Alzheimer’s disease, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, begins with disruption of proteostasis. This process, once initiated, cannot currently be self-resolved and will inevitably lead to pathological protein accumulation that eventually progresses to neurodegeneration. The failure to effectively maintain brain proteostasis is likely due to dampened innate immunity and lack of adaptive immunity in brain parenchyma, which jeopardize the brain’s clearance machinery compared to peripheral tissues. Boosting immune activity in the brain to enhance waste clearance under homeostatic or pathological status without damaging neurons may be an alternative strategy. Specific reprogramming of microglia to enhance the clearance of amyloid-β seeds and plaques without amplifying inflammatory stress or targeting neurons; or connecting adaptive immunity with brain innate immunity, such as pathology-directed antibody treatment or T cell-based strategies, are promising fields that should be worked out with caution to avoid potential side effects. For intracellular tau pathology that may be difficult to target by immune cells without damaging neurons, activating intrinsic or applying extrinsic neuronal protein degradation programmes could be considered.
