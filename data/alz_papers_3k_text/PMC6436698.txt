Association of Midlife Diet With Subsequent Risk of Dementia

# Abstract
Observational studies suggest that diet is linked to cognitive health. However, the duration of follow-up in many studies is not sufficient to take into account the long preclinical phase of dementia and the evidence from intervention studies is not conclusive. To examine whether midlife diet is associated with subsequent risk of dementia. Population-based cohort study established in 1985-1888, with dietary intake assessment in 1991-1993, 1997-1999 and 2002-2004; follow-up for incident dementia until March 2017. Food frequency questionnaire to derive the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), an 11-component diet quality score (range=0-110), with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. Incident dementia ascertained through linkage to electronic health records. Among 8225 (mean age 50.2 (SD, 6.1) years; 5686, 69.1% men) dementia-free participants in 1991-1993 a total of 344 cases of incident dementia were recorded over a median follow-up of 24.8 (IQR, 24.2 to 25.1) years. No significant difference in incidence rate (IR) of dementia was observed in tertiles of AHEI exposure in 1991-1993, 1997-1999 (median follow-up 19.1 years) and 2002-2004 (median follow-up 13.5 years). Compared with IR of dementia of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.47-2.12) per 1000 person-years in the worst tertile of AHEI (lowest tertile of diet quality) in 1991-1993, the absolute rate differences for the intermediate and the best tertiles were, respectively, 0.03 (95 % CI, -0.43 to 0.49) and 0.04 (95% CI, -0.42 to 0.51) per 1000 person-years. In 1997-1999, the absolute rate differences in the intermediate and the best AHEI tertiles compared to the worst tertile (IR=2.06 (95% CI, 1.62-2.61) per 1000 person-years) were respectively 0.14 (95 % CI, -0.58 to 0.86) and 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.85) per 1000 person-years. In 2002-2004, these absolute rate differences with the worst AHEI tertile (IR=3.12 (95% CI, 2.49-3.92) per 1000 person-years) were respectively -0.61 (95 % CI, -1.56 to 0.33) and -0.73 (95% CI, -1.67 to 0.22) per 1000 person-years in the intermediate and best AHEI tertiles. In multivariate analysis, HRs of dementia per 10-point AHEI increment were not significant as assessed in 1991-1993 (0.97, 95% CI, 0.87-1.08)), in 1997-1999 (0.97, 95% CI, 0.83-1.12)), or in 2002-2004 (0.87, 95% CI, 0.75-1.00)). In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed in midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk of dementia.

## Introduction
The number of dementia cases, estimated at 47 million in 2015, is expected to triple over the next 30 years. 1 In the absence of a cure, prevention is crucial and modifiable exposures in midlife are increasingly emphasized in dementia prevention guidelines. 2 The role of specific nutrients in brain function 3 and the fact that diet is potentially modifiable has led to research on the association between dietary factors and cognitive ageing.

Numerous studies have examined cognitive outcomes in relation to a single nutrient or food item. However, there are conceptual and methodological limitations to these studies. Nutrient interactions may be complex, the independent effect of one nutrient or food is difficult to assess, and because the causes of dementia are multifactorial, the association with a single food or nutrient may be too small to be detected reliably. 4 Therefore, research increasingly focuses on an overall diet approach 5 and several studies have reported an association between overall diet and cognitive decline, 6 brain imaging biomarkers, 7 , 8 and dementia risk. 9 Despite several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies in recent years, 6 , 9 no firm conclusions can be drawn. Intervention studies on diet modification and/or supplementation do not show an effect, 10 – 13 with one exception. 14 Most previous studies on diet and dementia had a short follow-up, typically less than 10 years where reverse causation may bias results as dietary behavior and nutrient intake may be altered during the long preclinical period of dementia. 15

This study examined the association of midlife diet quality, using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and dietary patterns, with subsequent incidence of dementia and cognitive decline.

## Methods
The protocol of the Whitehall II study was approved by the Joint UCL/UCLH Committee on the Ethics of Human Research and renewed at each contact. All participants provided written informed consent at each contact in this an on-going prospective cohort study established in 1985-1988 among 10308 civil servants (6895 men and 3413 women). 16 All persons aged 35-55 years working in 20 London based departments were invited to participate by letter, and 73% agreed. Since baseline, follow-up clinical examinations have taken place approximately every five years: 1991-1993, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, and 2015-2016.

Dietary intake was assessed in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 using a machine-readable food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 17 based on the version used in the US Nurses’ Health Study. 18 The food list (127 items) in the FFQ was anglicized, and adapted to include foods commonly eaten in the United Kingdom (UK). 19 Details of analysis to estimate nutrients and total energy intake are provided in eMethods in the Supplement. Participants with an incomplete FFQ (> 10% missing items) and participants with unreasonably high (>3500 kcal/day for women and >4200 kcal/day for men) or low intakes (<500 kcal/day for women and <800 kcal/day for men) were excluded to avoid influence of outliers. The FFQ data were used to assess diet quality using the AHEI (primary exposure) and to derive a posteriori dietary patterns (secondary exposure).

This diet score is based on 11 components: six components for which the highest intake is seen to be ideal: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long chain omega-3 fats, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (excluding long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids); and four components for which avoidance or lowest intake is seen to be ideal: sugar sweetened drinks and fruit juice, red and processed meat, trans fat, sodium; and one component - the alcohol intake - for which moderate consumption is thought to be ideal. The total AHEI score ranges from 0 to 110, with higher scores representing a healthier diet. Scoring criteria for AHEI and its distribution are described in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Along with AHEI score at the three time points (1991-1993, 1997-1999, 2002-2004), the mean of the three measures was also calculated to reduce measurement error inherent in single assessments and to reflect long-term dietary intake.

According to the nutrient profile and culinary use of food items, the 127 items of the FFQ were grouped in 37 predefined food groups ( eTable 2 in the Supplement). Dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis (factor procedure in SAS software; version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Orthogonal transformation (Varimax rotation function) was undertaken to allow greater interpretability and independence of factors. Two factors were retained based on eigenvalues, the Scree plot, the interpretability of factors, and percentage of variance explained by the factors. The first pattern was labelled “ Healthy food ” and had high loading on items indicating intake of vegetables, fruits and fish. The second pattern, labelled “ Western-type” diet, was heavily loaded by consumption of fried food, processed and red meat, pies, chocolate and sweets, high-fat dairy products, and refined grains ( eTable 3 in the Supplement). Each participant received a score for both these patterns (range, -2.6 to 12.7 for “Healthy food” and -2.7 to 7.3 for “Western-type” patterns) based on their food intake, higher scores indicate higher food intake of the particular dietary pattern.

The primary outcome was incident dementia and the secondary outcome was cognitive decline between 1997-1999 and 2015-2016.

Dementia cases were ascertained using linkage to three electronic health records: the national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS), and the mortality register. Record linkage for every year of follow-up was available for all participants until 31 st March 2017 (or date of death in those who died before this date). Dementia cases were identified using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases 10 th edition) codes F00, F01, F02, F03, F05.1, G30 and G31.0. The NHS in the UK (England, Scotland, and Wales) provides most of the healthcare, including outpatient and inpatient care; private medical insurance, held by around 11% of the UK population (2014 figures), 21 is mainly used for elective surgery rather than chronic conditions such as dementia. The sensitivity and specificity of dementia in the HES data is 78.0% and 92.0%. 22 In addition, the MHSDS, a national database that contains information on contact with mental health service in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and the community was used. Mortality data came from the British national mortality register (National Health Service (NHS) Central Registry). Linkage was undertaken using unique NHS identification number given to each resident in the UK. The date of dementia was set as the first record of dementia in any of the three databases used for dementia ascertainment.

A cognitive test battery was introduced to the study in 1997-1999 and repeated using the same tests at all subsequent assessments, allowing analysis using five waves of data between 1997-1999 (age of participants=45-69 years) and 2015-2016 (age=63-86 years).

Memory was assessed using a 20-word free recall test (range of possible values, 0-20). Participants were presented a list of one or two syllable words at two second intervals and were then asked to recall in writing as many of the words as possible in any order with two minutes to do so. Executive function was assessed with the Alice Heim 4-I test, which is composed of a series of 65 verbal and mathematical reasoning items of increasing difficulty (range, 0-65). 23 It tests inductive reasoning, measuring the ability to identify patterns and infer principles and rules. Participants had 10 minutes to do this section. Fluency was assessed using phonemic (range, 0-35) and semantic (range, 0-35) fluency tests. 24 Participants were asked to recall in writing as many words beginning with “s” (phonemic fluency) and as many animal names (semantic fluency) as they could. One minute was allowed for each test. The tests have good test-retest reliability (range 0.6-0.9), assessed in 556 participants and retested within three months in 1997-1999.

A global cognitive score was created by firstly standardizing the raw scores for each cognitive domain (memory, executive function, and fluency) to z-scores using mean and SD from the 1997-1999 wave to allow cognitive change from this time point to be estimated. These z-scores were summed and restandardized to yield the global score (range over the 5 assessments, -4.6 to 3.3). This approach minimizes measurement error in individual tests. 25 None of these cognitive tests have recognized minimal clinical important differences.

Sociodemographic covariates consisted of age, sex, marital status, occupational position, and education. Race/ ethnicity (self-reported through predefined categories and analyzed as a binary variable – white versus non-white (South-Asian, Black, Other) to allow sufficient numbers in each group) was also included in the analyses to account for the influence of socio-cultural factors on dietary habits and its association with dementia risk. Energy intake was derived from the FFQ. Health behaviors consisted of smoking status, alcohol consumption, and hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Health-related variables included hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and medications, depressive symptoms and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype. Details on assessment and categorization of covariates are provided in eMethods of the Supplement.

All analyses were exploratory, sensitivity analyses were post-hoc and only undertaken for dementia, the primary outcome. Analyses on the association between diet and cognitive decline (secondary outcome) aimed to assess similarity in associations between dementia and cognitive decline.

Diet quality scores assessed by the AHEI (primary exposure) and dietary patterns scores (secondary exposure) were grouped into tertiles to allow sufficient number of dementia cases in each category, and also modelled as continuous variables (estimations for 1 SD increment (10-point increment) in the AHEI score and in the Healthy food pattern and for 1 SD decrement in the Western type pattern so that all estimates corresponded to associations with better diet quality). Three sets of analyses were undertaken, as described below.

Cox proportional hazard models with age as the timescale were used to examine associations of diet with risk of incident dementia. Participants were censored at date of record of dementia, death (to account for competing risk of mortality) or March 31 st 2017, whichever came first. These analyses were undertaken using scores on diet (AHEI and dietary patterns) and covariates from 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 in three separate analyses. The proportional hazard assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals test. The association of mean AHEI (from three assessments) and incidence of dementia was also examined, with follow-up for dementia starting in 2002-2004 in these analyses. All analyses were first adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and energy intake, then for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, and then for health covariates. Among participants with data on APOE ε4 genotype, an additional adjustment with this covariate was undertaken.

Linear mixed-effect models 26 with random intercept and slope were used to examine trajectories of AHEI from 1991-1993 to 2002-2004 in participants who developed dementia subsequent to the last measure of AHEI compared to those who were free of dementia at the end of follow-up (March 2017 or date of death), dietary scores being the dependent variable in these analyses. These models used all available data over the follow-up, handled differences in length of follow-up, and took into account the fact that repeated measures on the same individual are correlated. The model included age in 1991-1993 (centred at 50 years), sex, race/ethnicity, incident dementia (coded as 1 for cases and 0 for all others), time since 1991-1993 and time squared and the interaction of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and dementia with slope terms (time and time squared). Estimation of differences in AHEI scores between incident dementia cases and non-cases for each year over the follow-up was undertaken using the MARGINS command in Stata.

Linear mixed-effect models, with intercept and slope fitted as random effects, were used to examine the association of diet assessed in 1991-1993 with cognitive function in 1997-1999 and subsequent 18-year cognitive decline. The basic model included the following terms: time since 1997-1999, time squared, age in 1991-1993 (centered at mean age (50 years)), sex, race/ethnicity, total energy intake, the dietary exposure of interest, their interactions with time, and the interaction between age and time squared to account for accelerated cognitive decline at older ages. An interaction term between the dietary score and time was used to test differences in cognitive decline according to tertiles of dietary exposures. The analyses were further adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related factors and their interactions with time.

Six post-hoc sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess robustness of findings: 1) Fine and Gray model, an alternative method to account for competing risk of death, 2) classification of dementia into two categories: with and without CVD history to assess similarities in associations with diet, 3) inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for the influence of missing data, 4) improving statistical power by augmenting the number of dementia cases by also including persons with poor cognitive performance (<-2 SD or Mini Mental State Examination<18) as “possible” dementia cases, 5) analysis of the association between diet and mortality to ensure validity of the dietary exposures, 6) use of an alternate dietary measure, the Mediterranean diet (Med-Diet), which is widely used but not common in this population. Further details are provided in eMethods in the Supplement.

Apart from factor analysis for diet patterns derivation, all analyses were undertaken using Stata, version 15.1. Two-sided P values were used with an α=0.05 threshold for statistical significance. There was no adjustment for multiple comparisons, and therefore the analyses should be interpreted as exploratory.

## Results
Of the 10308 dementia-free participants at study recruitment in 1985-1988, 77 died before 1991-1993, 1416 did not participate in the 1991-1993 clinical examination, 581 had missing data on FFQ, and 9 had missing data on covariates, leading to a study population of 8225 participants for the analyses (study flow chart in Figure 1 ). Comparison between participants included and those excluded from the analyses are presented in eTable 4 in the Supplement. Mean age of participants included in the analyses for dietary exposure from 1991-1993 was 50.2 (SD, 6.1; range, 41-60) years; 5686 (69.1%) were men. For exposures in 1997-1999, mean age of the 5242 dementia free participants included in the analyses was 55.9 (SD, 6.1) years. In 2002-2004 mean age of the 5534 dementia free participants included in the analyses was 61.2 (SD, 6.0) years. Mean AHEI was 52.7 (SD, 10.0; range, 22-91) in 1991-1993, 53.9 (SD, 10.1; range, 21-92) in 1997-1999 and 54.2 (SD, 10.3; range, 19.5-94) in 2002-2004. Mean age of the participants alive at the end of follow-up (March 2017) was 74.2 (SD=5.8) years.

A median follow-up of 24.8 (Interquartile range (IQR), 24.2- 25.1; range, 0.1-25.6) years from the 1991-1993 dietary assessment yielded a total of 344 dementia cases. The mean age at dementia diagnosis was 75.6 (SD, 5.6) years. Cases of dementia accrued between 1995 and 2017, with 75.9% of cases recorded between 2010 and 2017. Characteristics of study population at baseline (1991-1993) according to tertiles of AHEI and dementia status are shown in Table 1 .

As there was no evidence of significant effect modification by sex and age (all P for interaction>0.17), analyses were undertaken without stratification. No significant difference in incidence rate (IR) of dementia was observed by tertiles of AHEI exposure in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 (median follow-up, 24.8 (IQR, 24.2- 25.1; range, 0.1-25.6), 19.1 (IQR, 18.6-19.4; range, 0.1-20.0), and 13.5 (IQR, 13.1-14.0; range, 0.1-14.5) years, respectively) ( Table 2 ). In 1991-1993, the IR of dementia among participants in the worst (range, 22.0-48.0), intermediate (range, 48.5-57.0) and best (range, 57.5-91.0) tertiles of AHEI were respectively 1.76 (95% CI, 1.47-2.12), 1.80 (95% CI, 1.50-2.15) and 1.81 (95% CI, 1.50-2.17) per 1000 person-years. The absolute rate differences per 1000 person-years of the intermediate and best AHEI tertiles compared with the worst AHEI tertile were respectively 0.03 (95 % CI, -0.43 to 0.49) and 0.04 (95% CI, -0.42 to 0.51). In 1997-1999, compared with IR of dementia of 2.06 (95% CI, 1.62-2.61) per 1000 person-years among those in the worst tertile of AHEI (range, 21.0-49.5), the absolute rate differences per 1000 person-years of those in the intermediate (range, 50.0-58.0; IR, 2.20 (95% CI, 1.73-2.79)) and the best (range, 58.5-92.0; IR, 2.19 (95% CI, 1.73-2.77)) AHEI tertiles were respectively 0.14 (95 % CI, -0.58 to 0.86) and 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.85). In 2002-2004, compared with IR of dementia of 3.12 (95% CI, 2.49-3.92) per 1000 person-years among those in the worst tertile of AHEI (range, 19.5-49.5), the absolute rate differences per 1000 person-years with the intermediate (range, 50.0-58.5; IR, 2.51 (95% CI, 1.95-3.23)) and the best (range, 59.0-94.0; IR, 2.40 (95% CI, 1.84-3.11)) AHEI tertiles were respectively -0.61 (95 % CI, -1.56 to 0.33) and -0.73 (95% CI, -1.67 to 0.22).

In multivariate analyses, AHEI assessed in 1991-1993 and in 1997-1999 was not significantly associated with subsequent dementia risk whatever the level of adjustment for covariates ( Table 2 ). In analyses of AHEI exposure in 2002-2004, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and total energy intake, higher AHEI score was associated with lower risk of incident dementia over a mean 13.0 year of follow-up (HR per 10-point increment=0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98), P=0.02), association that persisted after adjustment for socio-demographic and behavioral factors (HR per 10-point increment=0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.99), P=0.04, eTable 5 of the Supplement), and became statistically non-significant after adjustment for measures of health (HR per 10-point increment=0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00), P=0.06). Additional adjustment for APOE ε4 genotype showed similar findings ( eTable 6 in the Supplement). Analyses with mean AHEI exposure (1991-1993, 1997-1999, 2002-2004) showed no significant association with incidence of dementia ( eTable 7 in the Supplement). In analyses adjusted for socio-demographic, health behaviors and health factors, no significant association was found between dietary patterns and subsequent risk of dementia ( Table 2 ).

Estimation of difference in AHEI score for each of the 12 years between 1991-1993 and 2002-2004 between participants who developed dementia between 2002-2004 and March 2017 compared to other participants showed no significant difference over the first 9 years of follow-up but a difference emerged in years 10 (difference in AHEI between incident dementia cases and non-cases=-1.26 (95% CI, -2.49 to -0.04; P=0.04)) to 12 (difference=-1.72 (95% CI, -3.28 to -0.16; P=0.03)) with lower AHEI score in those who went on to develop dementia ( Figure 2 ).

These analyses were undertaken on 6961 participants with cognitive data (flow chart in Figure 1 ). Estimated mean global cognitive z-scores in 1997-1999 and 18 years later by tertiles of AHEI and dietary patterns in 1991-1993 are shown in eTable 8 in the Supplement. AHEI and dietary patterns in 1991-1993 were not associated with global cognitive z-score in 1997-1999 in fully adjusted models ( Table 3 left panel).

Mean 18-year decline in the global cognitive z-score was -0.74 (95% CI, -0.76 to -0.73) of the baseline standard deviation. The right panel of Table 3 shows no significant association of AHEI (P for interaction with time=0.23) and “Western-type” diet (P for interaction with time=0.62) with cognitive decline; higher “Healthy food” score was associated with a greater cognitive decline (difference in cognitive decline per 1 SD increase in the “Healthy food” pattern=-0.03 (95% CI, -0.05 to -0.01), P for interaction with time=0.007). Further analyses using the dietary indices assessed in 1997-1999 confirmed the lack of significant associations with cognitive performance and cognitive decline ( eTable 9 in the Supplement).

First, analyses using Fine and Gray model to account for competing risk of mortality showed similar findings as the main analysis ( eTable 10 in the Supplement). Second, there were no significant associations of AHEI and dietary patterns (assessed in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004) with risk of incident dementia, irrespective of previous CVD history in persons with dementia. The exception was a reduced risk of dementia with history of CVD (Ncases/Ntotal=41/5529) in those with higher “Healthy food” score at the 2002-2004 dietary measure ( eTable 11 in the Supplement). Third, IPW to account for missing data ( eTable 12 in the Supplement) yielded similar findings to that in the main analysis for all dietary pattern scores from 1997-1999 and 2002-2004 but the association was further attenuated for AHEI assessed in 2002-2004 (HR per 10-point increment using IPW analysis=0.90 (95% CI, 0.77-1.04, P=0.16) compared to 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00, P=0.06) in the main analysis). Fourth, the definition of dementia including “possible” cases led to 785 cases in 8225 participants. In fully adjusted models, there was no significant association of AHEI and dietary patterns with subsequent risk of dementia using this definition ( eTable 13 in the Supplement). Fifth, better AHEI scores were consistently associated with lower risk of mortality irrespective of the length of follow-up ( eTable 14 in the Supplement). Sixth, the Med-Diet score was not significantly associated with incidence of dementia ( eTable 15 in the Supplement).

## Discussion
Midlife dietary quality, assessed by the AHEI and factor analysis derived dietary patterns, was not significantly associated with subsequent risk of dementia over a median 24.8-year follow-up or with 18-year cognitive decline. This finding was supported in analyses with repeat assessments of diet to attenuate measurement error and to account for long term dietary exposure.

Most studies on the association between diet and cognitive outcomes are based on elderly populations where overall quality was assessed primarily using a priori dietary indices rather than a posteriori dietary patterns. Irrespective of the method used to assess overall diet, 27 the findings are inconsistent. Slower cognitive decline and reduced risk of dementia have been found with adherence to the Recommended food score, 6 the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), 6 , 27 the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND), 27 and the AHEI 27 in some but not all studies. 28 – 30 By far the Med-Diet is the index that received most attention, 6 , 31 – 33 and it has been shown to be associated with better cognitive outcomes in some 31 , 33 but not all studies. 6 , 31 – 33

Dementia has a long preclinical period, involving pathophysiological changes over 15-20 years. 15 This period is characterized by accelerated cognitive decline, changes in mood and depressive symptoms 34 that are likely to affect lifestyle including dietary habits. 35 Prospective studies with a follow-up of less than 10 years may be not ideally suited to examine the association of diet with cognitive dysfunction. Differences in the length of follow-up may partly explain the inconsistency in findings across studies. Among the few studies with a follow-up longer than 10 years, 28 , 29 , 36 – 38 only one study used dietary patterns and reported that in 1006 community-dwelling Japanese participants (mean age at dietary assessment 68 years, median 15-year follow-up) customary Japanese dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of dementia. 38 All other studies used dietary indices. One of these studies with 3831 participants (mean age 74 years at dietary assessment) showed the DASH and the Med-Diet scores to be associated with better cognitive performance on the modified Mini Mental State Examination. 37 In this study, differences in cognitive performance were maintained but not modified over the 11-year follow-up; the authors concluded that their study could not assess the direction of the diet-cognitive decline association. 37 All other studies based on the Med-Diet, 28 , 29 , 36 DASH, 28 AHEI, 28 Healthy Diet Indicator (based on WHO recommendations) 29 and low carbohydrate high protein diet 29 scores did not find an association with cognitive outcomes. Results from the present study are in accordance with the absence of a significant association of diet with subsequent dementia risk and cognitive decline when the follow-up period is longer than 15 years. In this study the association was not statistically significant when the AHEI was assessed in late midlife, and the median follow-up was less than 15 years. As also reported in another study, 35 the present study suggested a slight decrease in diet quality in the years preceding dementia diagnosis, compatible with the hypothesis that change in diet quality is a feature, among others, of preclinical dementia. This observation of a possible signal could be explored in further studies.

The comprehensive approach of the present study, in terms of assessment of exposures and outcomes using longitudinal data, constitutes a major strength. The repeated dietary assessment starting in midlife using validated FFQ over 11 years combined with the assessment of dementia and cognitive decline over two decades allowed examination of the long-term association between diet and cognitive outcomes. The lack of a significant association between early midlife diet and cognitive outcomes is unlikely to be due to poor measures of diet quality as diet was associated with mortality in the present study. Whether a healthy diet plays a role in shaping cognitive outcomes in combination with other healthy behaviors or in sub-groups at increased risk of dementia remains unclear.

First, ascertainment of dementia using linkage to electronic health records is likely to miss milder cases 22 although it has the advantage of allowing analyses on all persons recruited to the study rather than only those who continue to participate for in-person assessment of dementia. Second, dietary intake was measured using a FFQ, a commonly used method in population studies, which is open to measurement errors common to all self-reported dietary assessments. 4 Third, the AHEI, our primary exposure, is based on a set of specific and limited food groups and might not cover all aspects of a “healthy” diet and may not be adapted to the dietary habits of all populations. However, results were similar using the Med-Diet index and factor analysis derived dietary patterns. Fourth, as with all observational studies it was not possible to rule out residual confounding.

## Conclusion
In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed in midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk of dementia.
