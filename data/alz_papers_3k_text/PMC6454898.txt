# Title
Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder

# Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 ASD cases and 27,969 controls that identifies five genome-wide significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), seven additional loci shared with other traits are identified at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we find both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.

## Results
As part of the iPSYCH project 10 , we collected and genotyped a Danish nation-wide population-based case-cohort sample including nearly all individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005 and diagnosed with ASD (according to ICD-10) before 2014. We randomly selected controls from the same birth cohorts ( Supplementary Table 1 ). We have previously validated registry-based ASD diagnoses 11 , 12 and demonstrated the accuracy of genotyping DNA extracted and amplified from bloodspots collected shortly after birth 13 , 14 . Genotypes were processed using Ricopili 15 , performing stringent quality control of data, removal of related individuals, exclusion of ancestry outliers based on principal component analysis, and imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 reference panel. After this processing, genotypes from 13,076 cases and 22,664 controls from the iPSYCH sample were included in the analysis. As is now standard in human complex trait genomics, our primary analysis was a meta-analysis of the iPSYCH ASD results with five family-based trio samples of European ancestry from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; 5,305 cases and 5,305 pseudo controls) 16 . All PGC samples had been processed using the same Ricopili pipeline for QC, imputation and analysis as employed here.

Supporting the consistency between the study designs, the iPSYCH population-based and PGC family-based analyses showed a high degree of genetic correlation with r G = 0.779 (SE = 0.106; P = 1.75 × 10 −13 ), similar to the genetic correlations observed between datasets in other mental disorders 17 . Likewise, polygenicity as assessed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) showed consistency across the samples supporting homogeneity of effects across samples and study designs (see the results below regarding PRS on a five-way split of the sample). The SNP heritability ( h G 2 ) was estimated to be 0.118 (SE = 0.010), for a population prevalence of 0.012 18 .

The main GWAS meta-analysis totaled 18,381 ASD cases and 27,969 controls, and applied an inverse variance-weighted fixed effects model. To ensure that the analysis was well-powered and robust, we examined markers with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.01, imputation INFO score ≥ 0.7, and supported by an effective sample size in > 70% of the total. This final meta-analysis included results for 9,112,387 autosomal markers and yielded 93 genome-wide significant markers in three separate loci ( Figure 1 ; Table 1a ; Supplementary Figures 1 – 44 ). Each locus was strongly supported by both the Danish case-control and the PGC family-based data. While modest inflation was observed (lambda = 1.12, lambda1000 = 1.006), LD score regression analysis 19 indicates this is arising from polygenicity (> 96%, see Methods ) rather than confounding. The strongest signal among 294,911 markers analyzed on chromosome X was P = 7.8 × 10 −5 .

We next obtained replication data for the top 88 loci with p-values < 1 × 10 −5 in five cohorts of European ancestry totaling 2,119 additional cases and 142,379 controls ( Supplementary Table 2 and 3 ). An overall replication of direction of effects was observed (53 of 88 (60%) of P < 1 × 10 −5 ; 16 of 23 (70%) at P < 1 × 10 −6 ; sign tests P = 0.035 and P = 0.047, respectively) and two additional loci achieved genome-wide significance in the combined analysis ( Table 1a ). More details on the identified loci can be found in Supplementary Table 4 and selected candidates are described in Box1 .

To investigate the extent of genetic overlap between ASD and other phenotypes we estimated the genetic correlations with a broad set of psychiatric and other medical diseases, disorders, and traits available at LD Hub 65 using bivariate LD score regression ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Table 5 ). Significant correlations were found for several traits including schizophrenia 15 ( r G = 0.211, P = 1.03 × 10 −5 ) and measures of cognitive ability, especially educational attainment 20 ( r G = 0.199, P = 2.56 × 10 −9 ), indicating a substantial genetic overlap with these phenotypes and corroborating previous reports 5 , 66 – 68 . In contrast to previous reports 16 , we found a strong and highly significant correlation with major depression 21 ( r G = 0.412, P = 1.40 × 10 −25 ), and we report a prominent overlap with ADHD 69 ( r G = 0.360, P = 1.24 × 10 −12 ). Moreover, we confirm the genetic correlation with social communication difficulties at age 8 in a non-ASD population sample reported previously based on a subset of the ASD sample 70 ( r G = 0.375, P = 0.0028).

In order to leverage these observations for the discovery of loci that may be shared between ASD and these other traits, we selected three particularly well-powered and genetically correlated phenotypes. These were schizophrenia (N = 79,641) 15 , major depression (N = 424,015) 21 and educational attainment (N = 328,917) 20 . We utilized the recently introduced MTAG method 9 which, briefly, generalizes the standard inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis for multiple phenotypes. In this case, MTAG takes advantage of the fact that, given an overall genetic correlation between ASD and a second trait, the effect size estimate and evidence for association to ASD can be improved by appropriate use of the association information from the second trait. The results of these three ASD-anchored MTAG scans are correlated to the primary ASD scan (and to each other) but given the exploration of three scans, we utilized a more conservative threshold of 1.67 × 10 −8 for declaring significance across these secondary scans giving an estimated maximum false discovery rate (maxFDR) of 0.021. In addition to stronger evidence for several of the ASD hits defined above, variants in seven additional regions achieved genome-wide significance, including three loci shared with educational attainment and four shared with major depression ( Table 1b , Box 1 , Supplementary Table 6 , Supplementary Figures 49 – 55 ). We note that in these seven instances, the effect size estimate is stronger in ASD than the secondary trait, that the result is not characteristic of the strongest signals in these other scans ( Supplementary Table 7 – 9 ) (and in fact 3 of these 7 were not significant in the secondary trait and constitute potentially novel findings). Moreover, we benchmarked against MTAG running two very large and heritable traits (height 74 , N = 252,288, and body mass index (BMI) 24 , N = 322,154) with no expected links to ASD and no significant loci were added to the list of ASD-only significant associations.

Next, we performed gene-based association analysis on our primary ASD meta-analysis using MAGMA 75 , testing for the joint association of all markers within a locus (across all protein-coding genes in the genome). This analysis identified 15 genes surpassing the significance threshold ( Supplementary Table 10 ). As expected, the majority of these genes were located within the genome-wide significant loci identified in the GWAS, but seven genes are located in four additional loci including KCNN2 , MMP12, NTM and a cluster of genes on chromosome 17 ( KANSLl , WNT3 , MAPT and CRHRl) ( Supplementary Figures 57 – 71 ). In particular, KCNN2 was strongly associated ( P = 1.02 × 10 −9 ), far beyond even single-variant statistical thresholds and is included in the descriptions in Box 1 .

Enrichment analyses using gene co-expression modules from human neocortex transcriptomic data (M13, M16 and M17 from Parikshak et al. 2013 76 ) and loss-of-function intolerant genes (pLI > 0.9) 77 , 78 , which previously have shown evidence of enrichment in neurodevelopmental disorders 69 , 76 , 79 , yielded only nominal significance for the latter ( P = 0.014) and M16 ( P = 0.050) ( Supplementary Table 11 ). Genes implicated in ASD by studies or rare variants in Sanders et al. 56 was just shy of showing nominally significant enrichment ( P = 0.063) while enrichment in the curated gene list from the SPARK consortium 80 was significant ( P = 0.0034). Likewise, analysis of Gene Ontology sets 81 , 82 for molecular function from MsigDB 83 showed no significant sets after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing ( Supplementary Table 12 ).

As ASD is a highly heterogeneous disorder, we explored how h G 2 partitioned across phenotypic sub-categories in the iPSYCH sample and estimated the genetic correlations between these groups using GCTA 84 . We examined cases with and without intellectual disability (ID, N = 1,873) and the ICD-10 diagnostic sub-categories: childhood autism (F84.0, N = 3,310), atypical autism (F84.1, N = 1,607), Asperger’s syndrome (F84.5, N = 4,622), and other/unspecified pervasive developmental disorders (PDD, F84.8–9, N = 5,795), reducing to non-overlapping groups when doing pairwise comparisons (see Supplementary Table 13 ). While the pairwise genetic correlations were consistently high between all subgroups (95% CIs including 1 in all comparisons), the h G 2 of Asperger’s syndrome ( h G 2 = 0.097 , SE = 0.001 was found to be twice the h G 2 of both childhood autism ( h G 2 = 0.049 , SE = 0.009, P = 0.001) and the group of other/unspecified PDD ( h G 2 = 0.045 , SE = 0.008, P = 0.001) ( Supplementary Tables 14 and 15 , Supplementary Figures 82 and 83 ). Similarly, the h G 2 of ASD without ID ( h G 2 = 0.086 , SE = 0.005) was found to be three times higher than for cases with ID ( h G 2 = 0.029 , SE = 0.013, P = 0.015).

To further examine the apparent polygenic heterogeneity across subtypes, we investigated how PRS trained on different phenotypes were distributed across distinct ASD subgroups. We focused on phenotypes showing strong genetic correlation with ASD (e.g., educational attainment), but included also traits with little or no correlation to ASD (e.g., BMI) as negative controls. In this analysis, we regressed the normalized scores on ASD subgroups while including covariates for batches and principal components in a multivariate regression. Of the eight phenotypes we evaluated, only the cognitive phenotypes showed strong heterogeneity (educational attainment 20 P = 1.8 × 10 −8 , IQ 23 P = 3.7 × 10 −9 ) ( Supplementary Figure 84 ). Interestingly, all case-control groups with or without intellectual disability showed significantly different loading for the two cognitive phenotypes: controls with intellectual disability have the lowest score followed by ASD cases with intellectual disability, and ASD cases without intellectual disability have significantly higher scores again than any other group ( P = 2.6 × 10 −12 for educational attainment, P = 8.2 × 10 −12 for IQ).

With respect to the diagnostic sub-categories constructed hierarchically from ASD subtypes ( Supplementary Table 13 ), it was again the cognitive phenotypes that showed the strongest heterogeneity across the diagnostic classes (educational attainment P = 2.6 × 10 −11 , IQ P = 3.4 × 10 −8 ), while neuroticism 67 ( P = 0.0015), chronotype 73 ( P = 0.011) and subjective well-being 67 ( P = 0.029) showed weaker but nominally significant degree of heterogeneity, and schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MD) and BMI 24 were non-significant across the groups ( P > 0.19) ( Figure 3 ). This pattern weakened only slightly when excluding subjects with intellectual disability ( Supplementary Figure 85 ). For neuroticism, there was a clear split with atypical and other/unspecified PDD cases having significantly higher PRS than childhood autism and Asperger’s, P = 0.00013. Considering the genetic overlap of each subcategory with each phenotype, the hypothesis of homogeneity across sub-phenotypes was strongly rejected ( P = 1.6 × 10 −11 ), thereby establishing that these sub-categories indeed have differences in their genetic architectures.

Focusing on educational attainment, significant enrichment of PRS was found for Asperger’s syndrome ( P = 2.0 × 10 −17 ) in particular, and for childhood autism ( P = 1.5 × 10 −5 ), but not for the group of other/unspecified PDD ( P = 0.36) or for atypical autism ( P = 0.13) ( Figure 3 ). Excluding individuals with intellectual disability only changes this marginally, with atypical autism becoming nominally significant ( P = 0.020) ( Supplementary Figure 85 ). These results show that the genetic architecture underlying educational attainment is indeed shared with ASD but to a variable degree across the disorder spectrum. We find that the observed excess in ASD subjects of alleles positively associated with education attainment 85 , 86 is confined to Asperger’s and childhood autism, and it is not seen here in atypical autism nor in other/unspecified PDD.

Finally, we evaluated the predictive ability of ASD PRS using five different sets of target and training samples within the combined iPSYCH-PGC sample. The observed mean variance explained by PRS (Nagelkerke’s R 2 ) was 2.45% ( P = 5.58 × 10 −140 ) with a pooled PRS-based case-control odds ratio OR = 1.33 (CI.95% 1.30–1.36) ( Supplementary Figures 89 and 91 ). Dividing the target samples into PRS decile groups revealed an increase in OR with increasing PRS. The OR for subjects with the highest PRS increased to OR = 2.80 (CI.95% 2.53–3.10) relative to the lowest decile ( Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure 92 ). Leveraging correlated phenotypes in an attempt to improve prediction of ASD, we generated a multi-phenotype PRS as a weighted sum of phenotype specific PRS (see Methods ). As expected, Nagelkerkes’s R 2 increased for each PRS included attaining its maximum at the full model at 3.77% ( P = 2.03 × 10 −215 ) for the pooled analysis with an OR = 3.57 (CI.95% 3.22–3.96) for the highest decile ( Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure 93 and 94 ). These results demonstrate that an individual’s ASD risk depends on the level of polygenic burden of thousands of common variants in a dose-dependent way, which can be reinforced by adding SNP-weights from ASD correlated traits.

In order to obtain information on possible biological underpinnings of our GWAS results we conducted several analyses. First, we examined how the ASD h G 2 partitioned on functional genomic categories as well as on cell type-specific regulatory elements using stratified LD score regression 87 . This analysis identified significant enrichment of heritability in conserved DNA regions and H3K4me1 histone marks 88 , as well as in genes expressed in central nervous system (CNS) cell types as a group ( Supplementary Figures 95 and 96 ), which is in line with observations in schizophrenia 15 , major depression 21 , and bipolar disorder 66 . Analyzing the enhancer associated mark H3K4me1 in individual cell/tissue 88 , we found significant enrichment in brain and neuronal cell lines ( Supplementary Figure 97 ). The highest enrichment was observed in the developing brain, germinal matrix, cortex-derived neurospheres, and embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neurons, consistent with ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder with largely prenatal origins, as supported by data from analysis of rare de novo variants 76 .

Common variation in ASD is located in regions that are highly enriched with regulatory elements predicted to be active in human corticogenesis ( Supplementary Figures 95 – 97 ). As most gene regulatory events occur at a distance via chromosome looping, we leveraged Hi-C data from germinal zone (GZ) and post-mitotic zones cortical plate (CP) in the developing fetal brain to identify potential target genes for these variants 89 . We performed fine mapping of 28 loci to identify the set of credible variants containing likely causal genetic risk 90 (see Methods ). Credible SNPs were significantly enriched with enhancer marks in the fetal brain ( Supplementary Figure 98 ), again confirming the likely regulatory role of these SNPs during brain development.

Based on location or evidence of physical contact from Hi-C, the 380 credible SNPs (28 loci) could be assigned to 95 genes (40 protein-coding), including 39 SNPs within promoters that were assigned to 9 genes, and 16 SNPs within the protein coding sequence of 8 genes ( Supplementary Table 16 , Supplementary Figure 98 ). Hi-C identified 86 genes, which interacted with credible SNPs in either the CP or GZ during brain development. Among these genes, 34 are interacting with credible SNPs in both CP and GZ, which represent a high-confidence gene list. Notable examples are illustrated in Figure 5 and highlighted in Box 1 . By analyzing their mean expression trajectory, we observed that the identified ASD candidate genes ( Supplementary Table 16 ) show highest expression during fetal corticogenesis, which is in line with the enrichment of heritability in the regulatory elements in developing brain ( Figure 5e – g ). Interestingly, both common and rare variation in ASD preferentially affects genes expressed during corticogenesis 76 , highlighting a potential spatiotemporal convergence of genetic risk on this specific developmental epoch, despite the disorder’s profound genetic heterogeneity.

## Discussion
The high heritability of ASD has been recognized for decades and remains among the highest for any complex disease despite many clinical diagnostic changes over the past 30–40 years resulting in a broader phenotype that characterizes more than 1% of the population. While early GWAS permitted estimates that common polygenic variation should explain a substantial fraction of the heritability of ASD, individually significant loci remained elusive. This was suspected to be due to limited sample size since studies of schizophrenia – with similar prevalence, heritability and reduced fitness – and major depression achieved striking results only when sample sizes five to ten times larger than available in ASD were employed. This study has finally borne out that expectation with definitively demonstrated significant “hits”.

Here we report the first common risk variants robustly associated with ASD by using unique Danish resources in conjunction with results of the earlier PGC data – more than tripling the previous largest discovery sample. Of these, five loci were defined in ASD alone, and seven additional suggested at a stricter threshold utilizing GWAS results from three correlated phenotypes (schizophrenia, depression and educational attainment) and a recently introduced analytic approach, MTAG. Both genome-wide LD score regression analysis and the fact that even among the loci defined in ASD alone there was additional evidence in these other trait scans indicate that the polygenic architecture of ASD is significantly shared with risk to adult psychiatric illness and higher educational attainment and intelligence. It should be noted that the MTAG analyses were carried out as three pairwise analyses. This way we avoid the complex interactions that could arise if we ran three or four correlated phenotypes at a time 9 . Indeed, what we get, despite the secondary summary statistics coming from large, high-powered studies, are relatively modest weights to the contributions from these statistics, because the genetic correlations are modest. The largest weight was 0.27 for schizophrenia, followed by 0.24 for major depression, and 0.11 for educational attainment. Moreover, the estimated worst case FDR was just 0.021 up just 0.001 from that of the ASD GWAS alone. Thus all loci identified by MTAG were found with an acceptable degree of certainty and have substantial contributions from ASD alone ( Table 1a , b and Supplementary Table 6 ). Our expectation is that most or all such loci will likely be identified in future ASD-only GWAS as sample sizes are increased substantially – however, given how new these methods are, the precise phenotypic consequences of these particular variants awaits expansion of all these trait GWAS.

In most GWAS studies there has been little evidence of heterogeneity of association across phenotypic subgroups. In this study, however, we see strong heterogeneity of genetic overlap with other traits when our ASD samples are broken into distinct subsets. In particular, the excess of alleles associated with higher intelligence and educational attainment was only observed in the higher functioning categories (particularly Asperger’s syndrome and individuals without comorbid intellectual disability) – and not in the other/unspecified PDD and intellectual disability categories. This is reminiscent, and logically inverted, from the much greater role of spontaneous mutations in these latter categories, particularly in genes known to have an even larger impact in cohorts ascertained for intellectual disability/developmental delay 91 . Interestingly, other/unspecified PDD and atypical autism also have a significantly higher PRS for neuroticism than childhood autism and Asperger’s. These different enrichment profiles observed provide evidence for a heterogeneous and qualitatively different genetic architecture between sub-types of ASD, which should inform future studies aiming at identifying etiologies and disease mechanisms in ASD.

The strong differences in estimated SNP heritability between ASD cases with and without intellectual disability, and highest in Asperger’s provide genetic evidence of longstanding observations. In particular, this aligns well with the observation that de novo variants are more frequently observed in ASD cases with intellectual disability compared to cases without comorbid intellectual disability, that IQ correlates positively with family history of psychiatric disorders 92 and that severe intellectual disability (encompassing many syndromes that confer high risk to ASD) show far less heritability than is observed for mild intellectual disability 93 , intelligence in general 94 and ASDs. Thus it is perhaps unsurprising that our data suggests that the contribution of common variants may be more prominent in high-functioning ASD cases such as Asperger’s syndrome.

We further explored the functional implications of these results with complementary functional genomics data including Hi-C analyses of fetal brains and brain transcriptome data. Analyses at genome-wide scale (partitioned h G 2 ( Supplementary Figures 95 – 97 ) and brain transcriptome enrichment ( Figure 5e – g )) as well as at single loci ( Figure 5a – d , Box 1 ) highlighted the involvement of processes relating to brain development and neuronal function. Notably, a number of genes located in the identified loci have previously been linked to ASD risk in studies of de novo and rare variants ( Box 1 , Supplementary Table 4 ), including PTBP2, CADPS , and KMT2E , which were found to interact with credible SNPs in the Hi-C analysis ( PTBP2, CADPS ) or contain a loss-of-function credible SNP ( KMT2E ). Interestingly, aberrant splicing of CADPS ’ sister gene CADPS2 , which has almost identical function, has been found in autism cases and Cadps2 knockout mice display behavioral anomalies with translational relevance to autism 95 . PTBP2 encodes a neuronal splicing factor and alterations in alternative splicing have been identified in brains from individuals diagnosed with ASD 96 .

In summary, we have established a first robust set of common variant associations in ASD and have begun laying the groundwork through which the biology of ASD and related phenotypes will inevitably be better articulated.

## Methods
The iPSYCH ASD sample is a part of a population based case-cohort sample extracted from a baseline cohort 10 consisting of all children born in Denmark between May 1 st 1981 and December 31 st 2005. Eligible were singletons born to a known mother and resident in Denmark on their one-year birthday. Cases were identified from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) 12 , which includes data on all individuals treated in Denmark at psychiatric hospitals (from 1969 onwards) as well as at outpatient psychiatric clinics (from 1995 onwards). Cases were diagnosed with ASD in 2013 or earlier by a psychiatrist according to ICD10, including diagnoses of childhood autism (ICD10 code F84.0), atypical autism (F84.1), Asperger’s syndrome (F84.5), other pervasive developmental disorders (F84.8), and pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified (F84.9). As controls we selected a random sample from the set of eligible children excluding those with an ASD diagnosis by 2013.

The samples were linked using the unique personal identification number to the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank (DNSB) at Statens Serum Institute (SSI), where DNA was extracted from Guthrie cards and whole genome amplified in triplicates as described previously 13 , 97 . Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (Cambridge, MA, USA) using the PsychChip array from Illumina (CA, San Diego, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Genotype calling of markers with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01 was performed by merging callsets from GenCall 98 and Birdseed 99 while less frequent variants were called with zCall 100 . Genotyping and data processing was carried out in 23 waves.

All analyses of the iPSYCH sample and joint analyses with the PGC samples were performed at the secured national GenomeDK high performance-computing cluster in Denmark.

The study was approved by the Regional Scientific Ethics Committee in Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency.

In brief, five cohorts provided genotypes to the sample (N denoting the number of trios for which genotypes were available): The Geschwind Autism Center of Excellence (ACE; N = 391), the Autism Genome Project 62 (AGP; N = 2,272), the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange 101 , 102 (AGRE; N = 974), the NIMH Repository, the Montreal 103 /Boston Collection (MONBOS; N = 1,396, and the Simons Simplex Collection 104 , 105 (SSC; N = 2,231). The trios were analyzed as cases and pseudo controls. A detailed description of the sample is available on the PGC web site and even more details are provided in Anney et al 5 . Analyses of the PGC genotypes were conducted on the computer cluster LISA at the Dutch HPC center SURFsara.

As follow-up for the loci with p-values less than 10 −6 we asked for look up in five samples of Nordic and Eastern European origin with altogether 2,119 cases and 142,379 controls: BUPGEN (Norway: 164 cases and 656 controls), PAGES (Sweden: 926 cases and 3,841 controls not part of the PGC sample above), the Finnish autism case-control study (Finland: 159 cases and 526 controls), deCODE (Iceland 574 cases and 136,968 controls; Eastern Europe: 296 cases and 388 controls). See Supplementary Note for details.

All statistical tests are two-sided unless otherwise stated. Software versions etc. can be found in Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

Ricopili 15 , the pipeline developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) Statistical Analysis Group was used for quality control, imputation, principle component analysis (PCA) and primary association analysis. For details see the Supplementary Note . The data were processed separately in the 23 genotyping batches in the case of iPSYCH and separately for each study in the PGC sample. Phasing was achieved using SHAPEIT 106 and imputation done by IMPUTE2 107 , 108 with haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, phase 3 109 (1kGP3) as reference.

After excluding regions of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) 110 , the genotypes were pruned down to a set of roughly 30k markers. See supplementary Note for details. Using PLINK’s 111 identity by state analysis, pairs of subjects were identified with π ^ > 0.2 and one subject of each such pair was excluded at random (with a preference for keeping cases). PCA was carried out using smartPCA 112 , 113 . In iPSYCH, a subsample of European ancestry was selected as an ellipsoid in the space of PC1–3 centred and scaled using the mean and eight standard deviation of the subsample whose parents and grandparents were all known to have been born in Denmark (N = 31,500). In the PGC sample the European (CEU) subset was chosen using a Euclidian distance measure weighted by the variance explained by each of the first 3 principal components. Individuals more distant than 10 standard deviations from the combined CEU and Toscani in Italy (TSI) HapMap reference populations were excluded. We conducted a secondary PCA on the remaining 13,076 cases and 22,664 controls to provide covariates for the association analyses. Numbers of subjects in the data generation flow for the iPSYCH sample are found in Supplementary Table 1 .

Association analyses were done by applying PLINK 1.9 to the imputed dosage data (the sum of imputation probabilities P(A1A2) + 2P(A1A1)). In iPSYCH we included the first four principal components (PCs) as covariates as well as any PC beyond that, which were significantly associated with ASD in the sample, while the case-pseudo-controls from the PGC trios required no PC covariates. Combined results for iPSYCH and for iPSYCH with the PGC was achieved by meta-analysing batch-wise and study-wise results using METAL 114 (July 2010 version) employing an inverse variance weighted fixed effect model 115 . On chromosome X males and females were analyzed separately and then meta-analyzed together. Subsequently we applied a quality filter allowing only markers with an imputation info score ≥ 0.7, MAF ≥ 0.01 and an effective sample size (see Supplementary Note ) of at least 70% of the study maximum. The degree to which the deviation in the test statistics can be ascribed to cryptic relatedness and population stratification rather than to polygenicity was measured from the intercept in LD score regression 19 (LDSC) as the ratio of (intercept-1) and (mean(χ 2 )-1).

MTAG 9 was applied with standard settings. The iPSYCH-PGC meta-analysis summary statistics were paired up with the summary statistics for each of major depression 21 (excluding the Danish sampled but including summary statistics from 23andMe 22 ; 111,902 cases, 312,113 controls, and mean χ 2 = 1.477), schizophrenia 15 (also excluding the Danish samples; 34,129 cases, 45,512 controls, and mean χ 2 = 1.804) and educational attainment 20 (328,917 samples and mean χ 2 = 1.648). These are studies that have considerably more statistical power than the ASD scan, but the genetic correlations are modest in the context of MTAG, so the weights ascribed to the secondary phenotypes in the MTAG analyses remain relatively low (no higher than 0.27). The maximum FDR was estimated as recommended in the MTAG paper 9 . See Supplementary Note for details. The results were clumped and we highlighted loci of interest by selecting those that were significant at 5 × 10 −8 in the iPSYCH-PGC meta-analysis or the meta-analysis with the follow-up sample or were significant at 1.67 × l0 −8 in any of the three MTAG analyses. The composite GWAS consisting of the minimal p-values at each marker over these five analyses was used as a background when creating Manhattan plots for the different analyses showing both what is maximally achieved and what the individual analysis contributes to that.

MAGMA 1.06 75 was applied to the ASD GWAS summary statistics to test for gene-based association. Using NCBI 37.3 gene definitions and restricting the analysis to SNPs located within the transcribed region, mean SNP association was tested with the sum of −log(SNP p-value) as test statistic. The resulting gene-based p-values were further used in competitive gene-set enrichment analyses in MAGMA. One analysis explored the candidate sets M13, M16 and M17 from Parikshak et al. 2013 76 , constrained, loss-of-function intolerant genes (pLI > 0.9) 77 , 78 derived from data of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (see Supplementary Note for details), as well as gene sets found in studies of rare variants in autism by Sanders et al. 56 and the curated gene list from the SPARK consortium 80 . Another was an agnostic analysis of the Gene Ontology sets 81 , 82 for molecular function from MsigDB 6.0 83 . We analyzed only genes outside the broad MHC region (hg19:chr6:25–35M) and included only gene sets with 10–1,000 genes. The gene set from Sanders et al. and SPARK include only one gene in MHC and was exempt from the MHC exclusion to be as true to the set as possible. All gene sets with significant enrichment were inspected to ensure that the signal was not driven by one or a few associated loci with multiple genes in close LD.

SNP heritability, h G 2 , was estimated using LDSC 19 for the full ASD GWAS sample and GCTA 84 , 116 , 117 for subsamples too small for LDSC. For LDSC we used precomputed LD scores based on the European ancestry samples of the 1000 Genomes Project 118 restricted to HapMap3 119 SNPs. The summary stats with standard LDSC filtering were regressed onto these scores. For liability scale estimates, we used a population prevalence for Denmark of 1.22% 18 . Lacking proper prevalence estimates for subtypes, we scaled the full spectrum prevalence based on the composition of the case sample.

For subsamples too small for LDSC, the GREML approach of GCTA 84 , 116 , 117 was used. On best guess genotypes (genotype probability > 0.8, missing rate < 0.01 and MAF > 0.05) with INDELs removed, a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) was fitted for the association sample (i.e. the subjects of European ancestry with π ^ ≤ 0.2 ) providing a relatedness estimate for all pairwise combinations of individuals. Estimation of the phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs (REML) was performed including PC 1–4 as continuous covariates together with any other PC that was nominally significantly associated to the phenotype as well as batches as categorical indicator covariates. Testing equal heritability for non-overlapping groups was done by permutation test (with 1000 permutations) keeping the controls and randomly assigning the different case labels.

Following Finucane et al. 87 , we conducted an enrichment analysis of the heritability for SNPs for functional annotation and for SNPs located in cell-type-specific regulatory elements. Using first the same 24 overlapping functional annotations (stripped down from 53) as in Finucane et al. we regressed the χ 2 from the ASD GWAS summary statistics on to the cell-type specific LD scores download from the site mentioned above with baseline scores, regression weights and allele frequencies based on European ancestry 1000 Genome Project data. The enrichment of a category was defined as the proportion of SNP heritability in the category divided by the proportion of SNPs in that category. Still following Finucane et al. we did a similar analysis using 220 cell type–specific annotations divided into 10 overlapping groups. In addition to this, we conducted an analysis based on annotation derived from data on H3K4Me1 imputed gapped peaks data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium 120 ; more specifically information excluding the broad MHC-region (chr6:25–35MB).

For the main ASD samples, SNP correlations, r G were estimated using LDSC 19 and for the analysis of ASD subtypes and subgroups where the sample sizes were generally small, we used GCTA 84 . In both cases, we followed the same procedures as explained above. For all but a few phenotypes, LDSC estimates of correlation were achieved by upload to LD hub 65 for comparison to all together 234 phenotypes.

For the polygenic risk scores (PRS) we clumped the summary stats applying standard Ricopili parameters (see Supplementary Note for details). To avoid potential strand conflicts, we excluded all ambiguous markers for summary statistics not generated by Ricopili using the same imputation reference. PRS were generated at the default p-value thresholds (5e-8, 1e-6, 1e-4, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1) as a weighted sum of the allele dosages in the ASD GWAS sample. Summing over the markers abiding by the p-value threshold in the training set and weighing by the additive scale effect measure of the marker (log(OR) or β) as estimated in the training set. Scores were normalized prior to analysis.

We evaluated the predictive power using Nagelkerke’s R 2 and plots of odds ratios and confidence intervals over score deciles. Both R 2 and odds ratios were estimated in regression analyses including the relevant PCs and indicator variables for genotyping waves.

Lacking a large ASD sample outside of iPSYCH and PGC, we trained a set of PRS for ASD internally in the following way. We divided the sample in five subsamples of roughly equal size respecting the division into batches. We then ran five GWAS leaving out each group in turn from the training set and meta-analyzed these with the PGC results. This produced a set of PRS for each of the five subsamples trained on their complement. Prior to analyses, each score was normalized on the group where it was defined. We evaluated the predictive power in each group and on the whole sample combined.

To exploit the genetic overlap with other phenotypes to improve prediction, we created a series of new PRS by adding to the internally trained ASD score the PRS of other highly correlated phenotypes in a weighted sum. See supplementary info for details.

To analyze ASD subtypes in relation to PRS we defined a hierarchical set of phenotypes in the following way: First hierarchical subtypes was childhood autism, hierarchical atypical autism was defined as everybody with atypical autism and no childhood autism diagnosis, hierarchical Asperger’s as everybody with an Asperger’s diagnosis and neither childhood autism nor atypical autism. Finally, we lumped other pervasive developmental disorders and pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified into pervasive disorders developmental mixed, and the hierarchical version of that consists of everybody with such a diagnosis and none of the preceding ones ( Supplementary Table 13 ). We examined the distribution over the distinct ASD subtypes of PRS for a number of phenotypes showing high r G with ASD (as well as a few with low r G as negative controls), by doing multivariate regression of the scores on the subtypes while adjusting for relevant PCs and wave indicator variables in a linear regression. See Supplementary Note for details.

The Hi-C data were generated from two major cortical laminae: the germinal zone (GZ), containing primarily mitotically active neural progenitors, and the cortical and subcortical plate (CP), consisting primarily of post-mitotic neurons 89 . We first derived a set of credible SNPs (putative causal SNPs) from the identified top ranking loci in the ASD GWAS using CAVIAR 90 . The 30 loci showing the strongest association was intersected with the Hi-C reference data resulting in 28 loci for analysis. To test whether credible SNPs are enriched in active marks in the fetal brain 120 , we employed GREAT as previously described 89 , 121 . Credible SNPs were sub-grouped into those without known function (unannotated) and functionally annotated SNPs (SNPs in the gene promoters and SNPs that cause nonsynonymous variants) ( Supplementary Figure 98 ). Then we integrated unannotated credible SNPs with chromatin contact profiles during fetal corticogenesis 89 , defining genes physically interacting with intergenic or intronic SNPs ( Supplementary Figure 98 ).

The spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of human brain was obtained from Kang et al 122 . We used transcriptomic profiles of multiple brain regions with developmental epochs that span prenatal (6–37 post-conception week, PCW) and postnatal (4 months-42 years) periods. Expression values were log-transformed and centered to the mean expression level for each sample using a scale(center=T, scale=F)+1 function in R. ASD candidate genes identified by Hi-C analyses ( Supplementary Figure 98 ) were selected for each sample and their average centered expression values were calculated and plotted.
