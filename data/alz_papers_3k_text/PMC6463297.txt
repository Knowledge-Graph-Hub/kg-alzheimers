# Title
Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease
identifies new risk loci and implicates Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid
processing

# Abstract
Risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), the most prevalent
dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we
performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed
LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify
five new genome-wide loci ( IQCK , ACE , ADAM10 , ADAMTS1, and WWOX ), two of which ( ADAM10 , ACE ) were identified in a recent genome-wide association
(GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer’s or dementia. Fine-mapping of the
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and
immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway
analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and
amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants
affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset
autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of
risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants ( P =
1.32 × 10 −7 ), indicating that additional rare variants
remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between
LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.

## Results
The Stage 1 discovery meta-analysis produced 12 loci with genome-wide
significance ( P ≤ 5 × 10 −8 )
( Table 1 ), all of which are
previously described 1 , 4 – 11 . Genomic inflation factors ( λ )
were slightly inflated ( λ median = 1.05; λ regression = 1.09; see Supplementary Figure 2 for a
quantile–quantile (QQ) plot); however, univariate linkage disequilibrium
score (LDSC) regression 12 , 13 estimates indicated that the
majority of this inflation was due to a polygenic signal, with the intercept
being close to 1 (1.026, s.e.m. = 0.006). The observed heritability
( h 2 ) of LOAD was estimated at 0.071 (0.011)
using LDSC. Stage 1 meta-analysis was first followed by Stage 2, using the
I-select chip we previously developed in Lambert et al. 1 (including 11,632 variants, n = 18,845; Supplementary Table 4 ) and finally
Stage 3A ( n = 11,666) or Stage 3B ( n = 30,511)
(for variants in regions not well captured in the I-select chip) (see Supplementary Figure 1 for the workflow). The final sample was 35,274 clinical and autopsy-documented
Alzheimer’s disease cases and 59,163 controls.

Meta-analysis of Stages 1 and 2 produced 21 genome-wide-significant
associations ( P ≤ 5 × 10 −8 )
( Table 1 and Fig. 1 ), 18 of which were previously reported as
genome-wide significant in Lambert et al. 1 . Three other signals were not initially described in the
initial IGAP GWAS: the rare R47H TREM2 coding variant
previously reported by others 7 , 8 , 14 ; ECHDC3 (rs7920721; NC_000010.10:
g.11720308A>G), which was recently identified as a potential
genome-wide-significant Alzheimer’s disease risk locus in several
studies 15 – 17 , and ACE (rs138190086; NC_000017.10: g.61538148G>A) ( Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ). In addition, seven
signals showed suggestive association with P < 5
× 10 −7 (closest genes: ADAM10, ADAMTS1,
ADAMTS20, IQCK , MIR142/ TSPOAP1-AS1 , NDUFAF6, and SPPL2A ) ( Supplementary Figs. 5 – 11 ). Stage 3A and
meta-analysis of all three stages for these nine signals (excluding the TREM2 signal; see Supplementary Table 5 for the
variant list) identified five genome-wide-significant loci. In addition to ECHDC3 , this included four new genome-wide
Alzheimer’s disease risk signals at IQCK, ADAMTS1, ACE, and ADAM10 ( Table
2 ) . ACE and ADAM10 were previously
reported as Alzheimer’s disease candidate genes 18 – 22 but were not replicated in some subsequent
studies 23 – 25 . A recent GWAS using family
history of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia as a proxy 26 also identified these two risk loci,
suggesting that while use of proxy Alzheimer’s disease/dementia cases
introduces less sensitivity and specificity for true Alzheimer’s disease
signals overall in comparison to clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s
disease, proxy studies can identify disease-relevant associations. Two of the
four other signals approached genome-wide significance: miR142/TSPOAP1-AS1 ( P = 5.3 ×
10 −8 ) and NDUFAF6 ( P =
9.2 × 10 −8 ) ( Table
2 ). Stage 3A also extended the analysis of two loci
( NME8 and MEF2C ) that were previously
genome-wide significant in our 2013 meta-analysis. These loci were not
genome-wide significant in our current study and will deserve further
investigation ( NME8 : P = 2.7 ×
10 −7 ; MEF2C : P = 9.1
× 10 −8 ; Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). Of note, GCTA
COJO 27 conditional
analysis of the genome-wide loci indicates that TREM2 and three
other loci ( BIN1 , ABCA7, and PTK2B/CLU ) have multiple independent LOAD association
signals ( Supplementary Table
6 ), suggesting that the genetic variance associated with some GWAS
loci is probably underestimated.

We also selected 33 variants from Stage 1 (28 common and 5 rare variants
in loci not well captured in the I-select chip; see Methods for full selection criteria) for genotyping in Stage
3B (including populations of Stage 2 and Stage 3A). We nominally replicated a
rare variant (rs71618613; NC_000005.9: g.29005985A>C) within an
intergenic region near SUCLG2P4 (MAF = 0.01; P
= 6.8 × 10 −3 ; combined P
= 3.3 × 10 −7 ) and replicated a
low-frequency variant in the TREM2 region (rs114812713;
NC_000006.11: g.41034000G>C, MAF = 0.03, P = 7.2
× 10 −3 ; combined P = 2.1 ×
10 −13 ) in the gene OARD1 that may
represent an independent signal according to our conditional analysis ( Table 2 , Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15 , Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 ). In addition,
rs62039712 (NC_000016.9: g.79355857G>A) in the WWOX locus reached genome-wide significance ( P = 3.7 ×
10 −8 ), and rs35868327 (NC_000005.9: g.52665230T>A)
in the FST locus reached suggestive significance
( P = 2.6 × 10 −7 ) ( Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17 ). WWOX may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease through
its interaction with tau 28 , 29 , and it is worth noting that
the sentinel variant (defined as the variant with the lowest P value) is just 2.4 mega-bases from PLCG2 , which contains a rare
variant that we recently associated with Alzheimer’s disease 14 . Since both rs62039712 and
rs35868327 were only analyzed in a restricted number of samples, these loci
deserve further attention.

To evaluate the biological significance and attempt to identify the
underlying risk genes for the newly identified genome-wide signals
( IQCK , ACE , ADAM10 , ADAMTS1, and WWOX ) and those found
previously, we pursued five strategies: (1) annotation and gene-based testing
for deleterious coding, loss-of-function (LOF) and splicing variants; (2)
expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses; (3) evaluation of
transcriptomic expression in LOAD clinical traits (correlation with the BRAAK
stage 30 and
differential expression in Alzheimer’s disease versus control
brains 31 ); (4)
evaluation of transcriptomic expression in Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissues 32 – 34 ; and
(5) gene cluster/pathway analyses. For the 24 signals reported here, other
evidence indicates that APOE 35 , 36 , ABCA7 (refs. 37 – 40 ), BIN1 (ref. 41 ), TREM2 ( refs. 7 , 8 ), SORL1 (refs. 42 , 43 ), ADAM10 (ref. 44 ), SPI1 (ref. 45 ), and CR1 (ref. 46 ) are the true Alzheimer’s disease
risk gene, although there is a possibility that multiple risk genes exist in
these regions 47 . Because many
GWAS loci are intergenic, and the closest gene to the sentinel variant may not
be the actual risk gene, in these analyses we considered all protein-coding
genes within ±500 kilobases (kb) of the sentinel variant linkage
disequilibrium (LD) regions ( r 2 ≥ 0.5) for
each locus as a candidate Alzheimer’s disease gene ( n =
400 genes) ( Supplementary
Table 8 ).

We first annotated all sentinel variants for each locus and variants in
LD ( r 2 > 0.7) with these variants in a search
for deleterious coding, LOF or splicing variants. In line with findings that
most causal variants for complex disease are non-coding 48 , only 2% of 1,073 variants across the 24
loci (excluding APOE ) were exonic variants, with a majority
(58%) being intronic ( Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supplementary Table 9 ). Potentially
deleterious variants include the rare R47H missense variant in TREM2 , common missense variants in CR1 , SPI1 , MS4A2, and IQCK ,
and a relatively common (MAF = 0.16) splicing variant in IQCK .
Using results of a large whole-exome-sequencing study conducted in the ADGC and
CHARGE sample 49 ( n = 5,740 LOAD cases and 5,096 controls), we also
identified ten genes located in our genome-wide loci as having rare deleterious
coding, splicing or LOF burden associations with LOAD (false discovery rate
(FDR) P < 0.01), including previously implicated
rare-variant signals in ABCA7 , TREM2, and SORL1 (refs. 14 , 49 – 55 ), and additional associations
with TREML4 in the TREM2 locus, TAP2 and PSMB8 in the HLA-DRB1 locus, PIP in the EPHA1 locus, STYX in the FERMT2 locus, RIN3 in the SLC24A4 locus, and KCNH6 in the ACE locus ( Supplementary Table 10 ).

For eQTL analyses, we searched existing eQTL databases and studies for
cis-acting eQTLs in a prioritized set of variants ( n = 1,873)
with suggestive significance or in LD with the sentinel variant in each locus.
Of these variants, 71–99% have regulatory potential when considering all
tissues according to RegulomeDB 56 and HaploReg 57 , but restricting to Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissues (via Ensembl Regulatory Build 58 and GWAS4D 59 ) appears to aid in regulatory variant
prioritization, with probabilities for functional variants increasing
substantially when using GWAS4D cell-dependent analyses with brain or monocytes,
for instance (these and other annotations are provided in Supplementary Table 11 ). Focusing
specifically on eQTLs, we found overlapping cis-acting eQTLs for 153 of the 400
protein-coding genes, with 136 eQTL-controlled genes in Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissues (that is, brain and blood/immune cell types; see Methods for details) ( Supplementary Tables 12 and 13 ). For our newly
identified loci, there were significant eQTLs in Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissue for ADAM10 , FAM63B , and SLTM (in the ADAM10 locus); ADAMTS1 ( ADAMTS1 locus); and ACSM1 , ANKS4B , C16orf62 , GDE1 , GPRC5B , IQCK , and KNOP1 ( IQCK locus). There were no eQTLs in Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissues in the WWOX or ACE locus, although several eQTLs for PSMC5 in coronary artery tissue were found for the ACE locus. eQTLs for genes in previously identified loci
include BIN1 ( BIN1 locus), INPP5D ( INPP5D locus), CD2AP ( CD2AP locus), and SLC24A4 ( SLC24A4 locus). Co-localization
analysis confirmed evidence of a shared causal variant affecting expression and
disease risk in 66 genes over 20 loci, including 31 genes over 13 loci in
LOAD-relevant tissue (see Supplementary Table 14 and 15 for complete lists). Genes
implicated include CR1 ( CR1 locus), ABCA7 ( ABCA7 loci), BIN1 ( BIN1 locus), SPI1 and MYBPC3 ( SPI1 locus), MS4A2 , MS4A6A , and MS4A4A ( MS4A2 locus), KNOP1 ( IQCK locus), and HLA-DRB1 ( HLA-DRB1 locus) ( Supplementary Table 12 ).

To study the differential expression of genes in brains of patients with
Alzheimer’s disease versus controls, we used 13 expression
studies 31 . We found
that 58% of the 400 protein-coding genes within the genome-wide loci had
evidence of differential expression in at least one study ( Supplementary Table 16 ). Additional
comparisons to Alzheimer’s disease related gene expression sets revealed
that 62 genes were correlated with pathogenic stage (BRAAK) in at least one
brain tissue 30 (44 genes in
prefrontal cortex, the most relevant LOAD tissue; 36 in cerebellum and 1 in
visual cortex). Finally, 38 genes were present in a set of 1,054 genes
preferentially expressed in aged microglial cells, a gene set shown to be
enriched for Alzheimer’s disease genes ( P = 4.1 ×
10 −5 ) 34 .
We also annotated our list of genes with brain RNA-seq data, which showed that
80% were expressed in at least one type of brain cell, and the genes were most
highly expressed in fetal astrocytes (26%), followed by microglia/ macrophages
(15.8%), neurons (14.8%), astrocytes (11.5%), and oligodendrocytes (6.5%). When
not considering fetal astrocytes, mature astrocytes (21%), and microglial cells
(20.3%), the resident macrophage cells of the brain thought to play a key role
in the pathologic immune response in LOAD 8 , 14 , 60 , became the highest expressed cell types
in the genome-wide set of genes, with 5.3% of the 400 genes showing high
microglial expression ( Supplementary Table 17 ; see Supplementary Table 18 for the
highly expressed gene list by cell type).

We conducted pathway analyses (MAGMA 61 ) separately for common (MAF > 0.01) and rare
variants (MAF < 0.01). For common variants, we detected four function
clusters including (1) APP metabolism/Aβ formation (regulation of
Aβ formation: P = 4.56 × 10 −7 and regulation of APP catabolic process: P = 3.54 ×
10 −6 ); (2) tau protein binding ( P = 3.19
× 10 −5 ); (3) lipid metabolism (four pathways including
protein−lipid complex assembly: P = 1.45 ×
10 −7 ); and (4) immune response ( P = 6.32
× 10 −5 ) ( Table 3 and Supplementary Table
19 ). Enrichment of the four clusters remained after removal of genes
in the APOE region. When APOE -region genes and
genes near genome-wide-significant genes were removed, tau showed moderate
association ( P = 0.027), and lipid metabolism and
immune-related pathways showed strong associations ( P <
0.001) ( Supplementary Table
20 ). Genes driving these enrichments (that is, having a gene-wide P < 0.05) included SCNA , a
Parkinson’s risk gene that encodes alpha-synuclein, the main component of
Lewy bodies, whch may play a role in tauopathies 62 , 63 , for the tau pathway; apolipoprotein genes
( APOM , APOA5 ) and ABCA1 ,
a major regulator of cellular cholesterol, for the lipid metabolism pathways;
and 52 immune pathway genes ( Supplementary Table 21 ). While no pathways were significantly
enriched for rare variants, lipid and Aβ pathways did reach nominal
significance in rare-variant-only analyses. Importantly, we also observed a
highly significant correlation between common and rare pathway gene results
( P = 1.32 × 10 −7 ), suggesting that
risk Alzheimer’s disease genes and pathways are enriched for rare
variants. In fact, 50 different genes within tau, lipid, immunity and Aβ
pathways showed nominal rare-variant driven associations ( P < 0.05) with LOAD.

To further explore the APP/Aβ pathway enrichment, we analyzed a
comprehensive set of 335 APP metabolism genes 64 curated from the literature. We observed
significant enrichment of this gene set in common variants ( P = 2.27 × 10 −4 ; P = 3.19 ×
10 −4 excluding APOE ), with both ADAM10 and ACE nominally significant
drivers of this result ( Table 4 and Supplementary Tables 22 and 23 ). Several
‘sub-pathways’ were also significantly enriched in the common
variants, including ‘clearance and degradation of Aβ’, and
‘aggregation of Aβ’, along with its subcategory
‘microglia’, the latter supporting microglial cells suspected role
in response to Aβ in LOAD 65 . Nominal enrichment for risk from rare variants was found
for the pathway ‘aggregation of Aβ: chaperone’ and 23 of
the 335 genes.

To identify candidate genes for our novel loci, we combined results from
our five prioritization strategies in a priority ranking method similar to that
of Fritsche et al. 66 ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 24 ). ADAM10 was the top ranked gene of the 11 genes within the ADAM10 locus. ADAM10, the most important α-secretase
in the brain, is a component of the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP
metabolism 67 and sheds
TREM2 (ref. 68 ), an innate
immunity receptor expressed selectively in microglia. Overexpression of ADAM10
in mouse models can halt Aβ production and subsequent
aggregation 69 . In
addition, two rare ADAM10 alterations segregating with disease
in LOAD families increased Aβ plaque load in
‘Alzheimer-like’ mice, with diminished α-secretase activity
from the alterations probably the causal mechanism 19 , 44 . For the IQCK signal, which is also an
obesity locus 70 , 71 , IQCK , a relatively
uncharacterized gene, was ranked top, although four of the other 11 genes in the
locus have a priority rank ≥ 4, including KNOP1 and GPRC5B , the latter being a regulator of
neurogenesis 72 , 73 and inflammatory signaling in
obesity 74 . Of the 22
genes in the ACE locus, PSMC5 , a key regulator
of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 75 , 76 , has a top
score of 4, while DDX42 , MAP3K3 , an important
regulator of macrophages and innate immunity 77 , 78 , and CD79B , a B lymphocyte antigen receptor subunit, each have a
score of 3. Candidate gene studies have associated ACE variants
with Alzheimer’s disease risk 20 , 22 , 79 , including a strong association in the
Wadi Ara, an Israeli Arab community with high risk of Alzheimer’s
disease 21 . However,
these studies yielded inconsistent results 23 , and our work reports a clear genome-wide association
in NHW at this locus. While ACE was not prioritized, it should
not be rejected as a candidate gene, as its expression in Alzheimer’s
disease brain tissue is associated with Aβ load and Alzheimer’s
disease severity 80 .
Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) are associated with Aβ levels 81 and LOAD risk 82 , and studies show ACE can inhibit
Aβ toxicity and aggregation 83 . Finally, angiotensin II, a product of ACE function,
mediates a number of neuropathological processes in Alzheimer’s
disease 84 and is now a
target for intervention in phase II clinical trials of Alzheimer’s
disease 85 . Another
novel genome-wide locus reported here, ADAMTS1 , is within 665
kb of APP on chromosome 21. Of three genes at this locus, our
analyses nominate ADAMTS1 as the likely risk gene, although we
cannot rule out that this signal is a regulatory element for APP . ADAMTS1 is elevated in Down’s syndrome with
neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease 86 , and it is a potential neuroprotective
gene 87 – 89 or a neuroinflammatory gene
important to microglial response 90 . Finally, WWOX and MAF ,
which surround an intergenic signal in an obesity associated locus 91 , were both prioritized for the WWOX locus, with MAF , another important
regulator of macrophages 92 , 93 , being highly expressed in
microglia in the Brain RNA-seq database, and WWOX , a
high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride–associated
gene 94 , 95 , being expressed most highly in
astrocytes and neurons. WWOX has been implicated in several neurological
phenotypes 96 ; in
addition, it binds tau and may play a critical role in regulating tau
hyper-phosphorylation, neurofibrillary formation and Aβ
aggregation 28 , 29 . Intriguingly, treatment of
mice with its binding partner restores memory deficits 97 , hinting at its potential in
neurotherapy.

For previously reported loci, applying the same prioritization approach
highlights several genes, as described in Fig.
2 , some of which are involved in APP metabolism ( FERMT2,
PICALM ) or tau toxicity ( BIN1 , CD2AP , FERMT2 , CASS4 , PTK2B ) 98 – 101 .
Pathway, tissue and disease trait enrichment analyses support the utility of our
prioritization method, as the 53 prioritized genes with a score ≥ 5 are
(1) enriched in substantially more Alzheimer’s disease–relevant
pathways, processes and dementia-related traits; (2) enriched in candidate
Alzheimer’s disease cell types such as monocytes (adjusted P
= 9.0 × 10 −6 ) and macrophages (adjusted P = 5.6 × 10 −3 ); and (3) more
strongly associated with dementia-related traits and Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant pathways ( Supplementary Table 25 and 26 ; see Supplementary Fig. 19 for the
interaction network of these prioritized genes). To further investigate the cell
types and tissues the prioritized genes are expressed in, we performed
differentially expressed gene (DEG) set enrichment analysis of the prioritized
genes by using GTEx 102 tissues, and we identified significant differential expression in several
potentially relevant Alzheimer’s disease tissues including immune-related
tissues (upregulation in blood and spleen), obesity-related tissue (upregulation
in adipose), heart tissues (upregulation in left ventricle and atrial
appendage), and brain tissues (dowregulation in cortex, cerebellum,
hippo-campus, basal ganglia, and amygdala). Furthermore, the 53 genes are
overexpressed in ‘adolescence’ and ‘young adult’
brain tissues in BrainSpan 103 , a transcriptomic atlas of the developing human brain, which
is consistent with accumulating evidence suggesting Alzheimer’s disease
may start decades before the onset of disease 104 , 105 ( Supplementary Fig. 20 ; see Supplementary Fig. 21 for a tissue
expression heat map for the 53 genes).

The above approach prioritized HLA-DRB1 as the top
candidate gene in the MHC locus, known for its complex genetic organization and
highly polymorphic nature (see Supplementary Fig. 22 for a plot of the region of the Stage 1
results). Previous analyses in the ADGC (5,728 Alzheimer’s disease cases
and 5,653 controls) have linked both HLA class I and II haplotypes with
Alzheimer’s disease risk 106 . In order to further investigate this locus in a much
larger sample, we used a robust imputation method and fine-mapping association
analysis of alleles and haplotypes of HLA class I and II genes in 14,776 cases
and 23,047 controls from our datasets ( Supplementary Table 27 ). We found
risk effects of HLA-DQA1 * 01:02 (FDR P = 0.014), HLA-DRB1 * 15:01 (FDR P = 0.083), and HLA-DQB1 * 06:02 (FDR P = 0.010) ( Supplementary Table 28 ). After
conditioning on the sentinel meta-analysis variant in this region (rs78738018),
association signals were lost for the three alleles, suggesting that the signal
observed at the variant level is due to the association of these three alleles.
These alleles form the HLA-DQA1 * 01:02~HLA-DQB1 * 06:02~HLA-DRB1 * 15:01 ( DR15 ) haplotype, which is also associated with
Alzheimer’s disease in our sample (FDR P = 0.013) ( Supplementary Table 29 ).
Taken together, these results suggest a central role of the DR15 haplotype in Alzheimer’s disease risk, a
finding originally discovered in a small study in the Tunisian
population 107 and
more recently in a large ADGC analysis 106 . Intriguingly, the DR15 haplotype and
its component alleles also associate with protection against diabetes 108 , a high risk for multiple
sclerosis 109 , 110 , and risk or protective
effects with many other immune-mediated diseases ( Supplementary Table 30 ). Moreover,
the associated diseases include a large number of traits queried from an
HLA-specific Phewas 111 ,
including neurological diseases (for example, Parkinson’s
disease 112 , 113 ) and diseases with risk factors for
Alzheimer’s disease (for example, hyperthyroidism 114 ), pointing to potential shared and/or
interacting mechanisms and co-morbidities, a common paradigm in the MHC
locus 115 . Two
additional alleles, HLA-DQA1 * 03:01 and HLA-DQB1 * 03:02 ,
belonging to another haplotype, show a protective effect on Alzheimer’s
disease, but their signal was lost after conditioning on HLA-DQA1 * 01:02 ,
and the HLA-DQA1 * 03:01~HLA-DQB1 * 03:02 haplotype is not associated with Alzheimer’s disease (FDR P = 0.651).

As described above, several of our genome-wide loci have potentially
interesting co-morbid or pleiotropic associations with traits that may be
relevant to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. To investigate the
extent of LOAD’s shared genetic architecture with other traits, we
performed LD-score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between LOAD
and 792 human diseases, traits and behaviors 12 , 116 ( Supplementary Table 31 ).
The common variant genetic architecture of LOAD was positively correlated with a
maternal family history of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia
( r g for the genetic correlation of two traits =
0.81; FDR P = 2.79 × 10 −7 ), similar to
the Marioni et al. family proxy analyses 26 , which found maternal genetic correlation with
Alzheimer’s disease to be higher than that for paternal
Alzheimer’s disease ( r g = 0.91 and 0.66,
respectively). There is substantial overlap between these estimates, as the
Marioni et al. analyses include the 2013 IGAP summary statistics and employed
the same UK Biobank variable that we used for r g estimates with maternal history of dementia. We also find significant negative
correlation between Alzheimer’s disease and multiple measures of
educational attainment (for example, college completion, r g = −0.24; years of schooling, r g range = −0.19 to −0.24;
cognitive scores, r g = −0.24 and
−0.25) (FDR P < 0.05), supporting the theory that
a greater cognitive reserve could help protect against development of
LOAD 117 . The extent
to which socioeconomic, environmental, or cultural factors contribute to the
correlation between educational attainment and risk for Alzheimer’s
disease is unknown, but research shows dementia risk to be associated with lower
socio-economic status, independently of education status 118 , 119 . We also found negative correlations at P < 0.05 with multiple measures of cardiovascular health (that is, family
history of high blood pressure and heart disease and vascular/heart problems)
and diabetes (that is, fasting proinsulin, basal metabolic rate and fasting
insulin), supporting previous research suggesting that use of blood pressure and
diabetic medications may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease 120 . In fact, use of blood
pressure medication does show a negative genetic correlation with
Alzheimer’s disease in our study ( r g =
−0.12; P = 0.035), although this result does not survive
FDR correction. These and other top results from this analysis (for example,
body mass index, height; see Supplementary Table 31 for a full list of other nominally
significant correlations) have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease
previously 116 , 120 – 127 , either through suggestive or
significant genetic or epidemiological associations (see Kuzma et al. 128 for a recent review), but
the multiple measures here support and emphasize their genetic correlation with
LOAD and highlight the possible genetic pleiotropy or co-morbidity of these
traits with pathology of LOAD.

## Discussion
In conclusion, our work identifies five new genome-wide associations for
LOAD and shows that GWAS data combined with high-quality imputation panels can
reveal rare disease risk variants (for example, TREM2 ). The
enrichment of rare variants in pathways associated with Alzheimer’s disease
indicates that additional rare variants remain to be identified, and larger samples
and better imputation panels will facilitate identifying them. While these rare
variants may not contribute substantially to the predictive value of genetic
findings, they will enhance the understanding of disease mechanisms and potential
drug targets. Discovery of the risk genes at genome-wide loci remains challenging,
but we demonstrate that converging evidence from existing and new analyses can
prioritize risk genes. We also show that APP metabolism is associated with not only
early-onset Alzheimer’s disease but also LOAD, suggesting that therapies
developed by studying early-onset families could also be applicable to the more
common late-onset form of the disease. Pathway analysis showing that tau is involved
in LOAD supports recent evidence that tau may play an early pathological role in
Alzheimer’s disease 129 – 131 and
confirms that therapies targeting tangle formation/degradation could potentially
affect LOAD. Finally, our fine-mapping analyses of HLA and genetic correlation
results point to LOAD’s shared genetic architecture with many immunemediated
and cognitive traits, suggesting that research and interventions that elucidate
mechanisms behind these relationships could also yield fruitful therapeutic
strategies for LOAD.

## Methods
All Stage 1 meta-analysis samples are from four consortia: ADGC, CHARGE,
EADI, and GERAD/PERADES. Summary demographics of all 46 case-control studies
from the four consortia are described in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 . Written informed
consent was obtained from study participants or, for those with substantial
cognitive impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian, or other proxy. Study
protocols for all cohorts were reviewed and approved by the appropriate
institutional review boards. Further details of all cohorts can be found in the Supplementary
Note .

Standard quality control was performed on all datasets individually,
including exclusion of individuals with low call rate, individuals with a high
degree of relatedness, and variants with low call rate. Individuals with
non-European ancestry according to principal components analysis of
ancestry-informative markers were excluded from the further analysis.

Following genotype chip quality control, each dataset was phased and
imputed to the 1,000 Genomes Project (phase 1 integrated release 3, March
2012) 132 using
SHAPEIT/IMPUTE2 133 , 134 or MaCH/Minimac 135 , 136 software ( Supplementary Table 3 ). All
reference population haplotypes were used for the imputation, as this method
improves accuracy of imputation for low-frequency variants 137 . Common variants (MAF ≥ 0.01%)
with an r 2 or an information measure <0.40
from MaCH and IMPUTE2 were excluded from further analyses. Rare variants (MAF
< 0.01%) with a ‘global’ weighted imputation quality score
of <0.70 were also excluded from analyses. This score was calculated by
weighting each variant’s MACH/IMPUTE2 imputation quality score by study
sample size and combining these weighted scores for use as a post-analysis
filter. We also required the presence of each variant in 30% of cases and 30% of
controls across all datasets.

Stage 1 single variant-based association analysis employed an additive
genotype model adjusting for age (defined as age-at-onset for cases and
age-at-last exam for controls), sex, and population substructure using principal
components 138 . The
score test was implemented on all case-control datasets. This test is optimal
for meta-analysis of rare variants due to its balance between power and control
of type 1 error 139 . Family
datasets were tested using GWAF 140 , with generalized estimating equations (GEE) implemented
for common variants (MAF ≥ 0.01), and a general linear mixed effects
model (GLMM) implemented for rare variants (MAF < 0.01), per our
preliminary data showing that the behavior of the test statistics for GEE was
fine for common variants but inflated for rare variants, while GLMM controlled
this rare-variant inflation. Variants with regression coefficient |β|
> 5 or P value equal to 0 or 1 were excluded from
further analysis.

Within-study results for Stage 1 were meta-analyzed in METAL 141 using an
inverse-variance-based model with genomic control. The meta-analysis was split
into two separate analyses according to the study sample size, with all studies
being included in the analysis of common variants (MAF ≥ 0.01), and only
studies with a total sample size of 400 or greater being included in the
rare-variant (MAF < 0.01) analysis. See the Supplementary Note for further
details of the meta-analyses methods.

Genomic inflation was calculated for lambda ( λ )
in the GenABEL package 142 . In
addition, we performed LDSC regression via LD Hub v.1.9.0 (refs. 12 , 13 ) to calculate the LD score regression intercept and
derive a heritability estimate for the inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis
summary statistics. The APOE region
(Chr19:45,116,911–46,318,605) was removed to calculate the intercept.
Removal of the APOE region reduced the heritability estimate
slightly from 0.071 (s.e.m. = 0.011) to 0.0637 (s.e.m. = 0.009).

LDSC was also employed via the LD Hub web server to obtain genetic
correlation estimates (rg) 116 between LOAD and a wide range of other disorders, diseases and human traits,
including 518 UK BioBank traits 143 . UK BioBank is a large long-term study (~500,000
volunteers aged 40 to 69) begun in 2006 in the United Kingdom, which is
investigating the contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental
exposure (that is, nutrition, lifestyle, and medications) to the development of
disease. While volunteers in the study are generally healthier than the overall
United Kingdom population 144 ,
its large size and comprehensive data collection make the study an invaluable
resource for researchers looking to interrogate the combined effect of genetics
and environmental factors on disease. Before analyses in LD Hub, we removed all
SNPs with extremely large effect sizes including the MHC
(Chr6:26,000,000–34,000,000) and APOE region, as
outliers can overly influence the regression analyses. A total of 1,180,989
variants were used in the correlation analyses. Statistical significance of the
genetic correlations was estimated using 5% Benjamini−Hochberg FDR
corrected P values.

GCTA COJO 27 was used
to conduct conditional analysis of the Stage 1 summary statistics, with 28,730
unrelated individuals from the ADGC as a reference panel for calculation of LD.
See URLs for methods for creation of the
‘ADGC reference dataset’.

Stage 2 genotypes were determined for 8,362 cases and 10,483 controls
( Supplementary Table
4 ). 1,633 variants from the I-select chip were located in the 24
genome-wide loci (defined by the LD blocks of the sentinel variants; excluding
the APOE region), with an average of 68 variants per locus. The
most well-covered loci were HLA-DRB1 , M24A2, and PICALM (763, 202, and 156 variants available,
respectively); the least were MAF , ADAMTS1, and INPP5D (0, 4, and 5 variants, respectively).

Stage 3A was conducted for variants selected as novel loci from
meta-analyses of Stages 1 and 2 with P < 5 ×
10 −7 (9 variants) and variants that were previously
significant ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) that
were not genome-wide significant after Stages 1 and 2 (2 variants) (4,930 cases
and 6,736 controls) ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Variants were genotyped using Taqman.

Stage 3B, which combined samples from Stage 2 and 3A, included variants
with MAF < 0.05 and P < 1 ×
10 −5 or variants with MAF ≥ 0.05 and P < 5 × 10 −6 in novel loci
not covered in the 2013 iSelect genotyping 1 (13,292 cases and 17,219
controls) ( Supplementary Table
7 ). See the Supplementary Note for details on selection of variants for Stage 3B
follow-up genotyping. For Stages 1, 2, and 3, samples did not overlap.

Per-sample quality checks for genetic sex and relatedness were performed
in PLINK. Sex mismatches or individuals showing a high degree of relatedness
(identical-by-descent value of 0.98 or greater) were removed from the analysis.
A panel of ancestry-informative markers was used to perform principal component
analysis with SMARTPCA from EIGENSOFT 4.2 software 145 , and individuals with non-European
ancestry were excluded. Variant quality control was also performed separately in
each country including removal of variants missing in more than 10% of
individuals, having a Hardy−Weinberg P value in controls
lower than 1 × 10 −6 or a P value for
missingness between cases and controls lower than 1 ×
10 −6 .

Per-study analysis for Stage 2 and Stage 3 followed the same analysis
procedures described for Stage 1, except for covariate adjustments per cohort,
where all analyses were adjusted on sex and age apart from the Italian, Swedish,
and Gr@ACE cohorts, which were also adjusted for principal components.
Within-study results were meta-analyzed in METAL 141 using an inverse-variance-based
model.

We determined the base-pair boundaries of the search space for potential
gene(s) and non-coding features in each of the 24 associated loci (excluding APOE ) using the ‘proxy search’ mechanism in
LDLink 146 . LDLink
uses 1,000 genomes genotypes to calculate LD for a selected population; in our
case all five European populations were selected (population codes CEU, TSI,
FIN, GBR, and IBS). The boundaries for all variants in LD
( r 2 ≥ 0.5) with the top associated
variant from the Stage 2 meta-analysis for each region ±500 kb of the
ends of the LD blocks (as eQTL controlled genes are typically less than 500 kb
from their controlling variant 147 ) were input into the UCSC genome browser’s
‘Table Browser’ for RefSeq 148 and GENCODEv24lift37 149 genes at each associated locus. The
average size of the LD blocks was 123 kb.

To identify deleterious coding or splicing variants that may represent
causal variants for our genome-wide loci, we first used SNIPA 150 to identify variants in high
LD (defined as r 2 > 0.7) with the sentinel
variants of the 24 genome-wide loci (excluding APOE )
( n = 1,073). The sentinel variants were defined as the
variants with the lowest P in each genome-wide locus. We then
used Ensembl VEP 151 for
annotation of the set of sentinel variants and their proxies. We used BLOSUM62
(ref. 152 ), SIFT 153 , Polyphen-2 (ref. 154 ), CADD 155 , Condel 156 , MPC 157 and Eigen 158 to predict the pathogenicity of
protein-altering exonic variants and MaxEntScan to predict the splicing
potential of variants. Splicing variants with high splicing potential according
to MaxEntScan 159 and
protein-coding variants predicted to be deleterious by two or more programs were
considered to be potentially causal variants for a locus. It should be noted
that while we do include rare variants from imputation in our analyses, we may
be missing many rare causal variants in this study.

We used the summary statistics results of a large whole-exome sequencing
(WES) study of LOAD, the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP)
case-control study ( n = 5,740 LOAD cases and 5,096 cognitively
normal controls of NHW ancestry) to identify genes within our genome-wide loci
that may contribute to the association signal through rare deleterious coding,
splicing or LOF variants. The individuals in the ADSP study largely overlap with
individuals in the ADGC and CHARGE cohorts included in our Stage 1
meta-analysis. All 400 protein-coding genes within our LD-defined genome-wide
loci were annotated with the gene-based results from this study, and the results
were corrected using a 1% FDR P as a cutoff for significance.
Complete details of the analysis can be found in Bis et al. 49 and the Supplementary Note .

To identify potential functional risk variants and genes at each
associated locus, we first annotated a list of prioritized variants from the 24
associated loci (excluding APOE ) ( n = 1,873).
This variant list combined variants in LD with the sentinel variants
( r 2 ≥ 0.5) using INFERNO 160 LD expansion
( n = 1,339) and variants with suggestive significance
( P < 10 −5 ) and LD
( r 2 ≥ 0.5) with the sentinel variants for
the 24 associated loci (excluding APOE ) ( n =
1,421 variants). We then identified variants with regulatory potential in this
set of variants using four programs that incorporate various annotations to
identify likely regulatory variants: RegulomeDB 56 , HaploReg v.4.1 (refs. 57 , 161 ), GWAS4D 59 , and the Ensembl Regulatory Build 58 . We used the ChromHMM (core 15-state
model) as ‘source epigenomes’ for the HaploReg analyses. We used
immune (Monocytes-CD14 + , GM12878 lymphoblastoid, HSMM myoblast) and
brain (NH-A astroctyes) for the Ensembl Regulatory Build analyses. We then used
the list of 1,873 prioritized variants to search for genes functionally linked
via eQTLs in LOAD relevant tissues including various brain and blood tissue
types, including all immune-related cell types, most specifically myeloid cells
(macrophages and monocytes) and B-lymphoid cells, which are cell types
implicated in LOAD and neurodegeneration by a number of recent studies 14 , 45 , 162 , 163 . While their specificity may be lower
for identifying Alzheimer’s disease risk eQTLs, we included whole blood
cell studies in our Alzheimer’s disease–relevant tissue class due
to their high correlation of eQTLs with Alzheimer’s
disease–relevant tissues (70% with brain 164 ; 51–70% for monocytes and
lymphoblastoid cell lines 165 )
and their large sample sizes that allow for increased discovery power. See the Supplementary Note for details on the eQTL databases and studies searched, and Supplementary Table 13 for sample
sizes of each database/study.

Formal co-localization testing of our summary Stage 1 results was
conducted using (1) COLOC 166 via INFERNO and (2) Summary Mendelian Randomization (SMR)-Heidi
analysis 167 . The
approximate Bayes factor (ABF), which was used to assess significance in the
INFERNO COLOC analysis, is a summary measure that provides an alternative to the P value for the identification of associations as
significant. SMR-Heidi analysis, which employs a heterogeneity test (HEIDI test)
to distinguish pleiotropy or causality (a single genetic variant affecting both
gene expression and the trait) from linkage (two distinct genetic variants in
LD, one affecting gene expression and one affecting trait), was also employed
for co-localization analysis. Genes located less than 1 Mb from the GWAS
sentinel variants that pass a 5% Benjamini–Hochberg FDR-corrected SMR P- value significance threshold and a HEIDI P- value > 0.05 threshold were considered
significant. The Westra eQTL 168 summary data and Consortium for the Architecture of Gene
Expression (CAGE) eQTL summary data were used for analysis. These datasets,
conducted in whole blood, are large eQTL studies (Westra: discovery phase n = 5,311, replication phase n = 2,775;
CAGE: n = 2,765), and while there is some overlap in samples
between the two datasets, CAGE provides finer coverage. The ADGC reference panel
dataset referenced above for GCTA COJO analysis was used for LD
calculations.

We also evaluated gene expression of all candidate genes in the
associated loci (see Supplementary Table 8 for a complete list of genes searched), using
differential Alzheimer’s disease gene expression results from
AlzBase 31 , brain
tissue expression from the Brain RNA-seq Database 32 , 33 (see URLs ), and the
HuMi_Aged gene set 34 , a set of
genes preferentially expressed in aged human microglia established through
RNA-seq expression analysis of aged human microglial cells from ten post-mortem
brains. AlzBase includes transcription data from brain and blood from aging,
non-dementia, mild cognitive impairment, early-stage Alzheimer’s disease,
and late-stage Alzheimer’s disease. See ALZBase (see URLs ) for a complete list of studies included in the
search. Correlation values for the BRAAK stage expression were taken from the
Zhang et al. 30 study of 1,647
post-mortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and non-demented subjects.

Pathway analyses were performed with MAGMA 61 , which performs SNP-wise gene analysis
of summary statistics with correction for LD between variants and genes to test
whether sets of genes are jointly associated with a phenotype (that is, LOAD),
compared to other genes across the genome. Adaptive permutation was used to
produce an empirical P value and an FDR-corrected q value. Gene sets used in the analyses were from
GO 169 , 170 , KEGG 171 , 172 , REACTOME 173 , 174 , BIOCARTA,
and MGI 175 pathways. Analyses
were restricted to gene sets containing between 10 and 500 genes, a total of
10,861 sets. Variants were restricted to common variants (MAF ≥ 0.01) and
rare variants (MAF < 0.01) only for each analysis, and separate analyses
for each model included and excluded the APOE region. Analyses
were also performed after removal of all genome-wide-significant genes. Primary
analyses used a 35-kb upstream/10-kb downstream window around each gene in order
to capture potential regulatory variants for each gene, while secondary analyses
were run using a 0-kb window 176 . To test for significant correlation between common and
rare-variant gene results, we performed a gene property analysis in MAGMA,
regressing the gene-wide association statistics from rare variants on the
corresponding statistics from common variants, correcting for LD between
variants and genes using the ADGC reference panel. The Aβ-centered
network pathway analysis used a curated list of 32 Aβ-related gene sets
and all 335 genes combined (see Campion et al. 64 for details). The combined dataset of
28,730 unrelated individuals from the ADGC referenced in the GCTA COJO analysis
was used as a reference set for LD calculations in these analyses.

Evaluation of the prioritization of the risk genes in genome-wide loci
was done using STRING 177 , and
Jensen Diseases 178 , Jensen
Tissues 179 , dbGAP
gene sets, and the ARCHS4 180 resource via the EnrichR 181 tool. We evaluated both the 400 genes set list and a list of 53 genes with
priority score ≥ 5 (adding in APOE to both lists as the
top gene in the APOE locus) using the standard settings for
both STRING and EnrichR. We used the q value, which is the
adjusted P value using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method
with a 5% cutoff for correction for multiple hypotheses testing. We also
performed ‘differentially expressed gene (DEG)’ sets analysis via
FUMA 182 . These
analyses were performed in order to assess whether our 53 prioritized genes were
significantly differentially expressed in certain GTEx v.7 (ref. 102 ; 30 general tissues and 53
specific tissues) or BrainSpan tissues (11 tissue developmental periods with
distinct DEG sets ranging from early prenatal to middle adulthood) 103 . FUMA defines DEG sets by
calculating a two-sided t -test per tissue versus all remaining
tissue types or developmental periods. Genes with a Bonferonni-corrected P < 0.05 and absolute log(fold change) ≥ 0.58
were considered DEGs. Input genes were tested against each of the DEG sets using
the hypergeometric test. Significant enrichment was defined by
Bonferonni-corrected P ≤ 0.05.

Non-familial datasets from the ADGC, EADI and GERAD consortiums were
used for HLA analysis. After imputation quality control, a total of 14,776 cases
and 23,047 controls were available for analysis ( Supplementary Table 27 ). Within
ADGC, GenADA, ROSMAP, TARC1, TGEN2, and a subset of the UMCWRMSSM datasets were
not imputed as Affymetrix genotyping arrays are not supported by the imputation
software.

Two-field resolution HLA alleles were imputed using the R package
HIBAG v.1.4 (ref. 183 )
and the NHW-specific training set. This software uses specific combinations
of variants to predict HLA alleles. Alleles with an imputation posterior
probability lower than 0.5 were considered as undetermined as recommended by
HIBAG developers. HLA-A , HLA-B , HLA-C class I genes, and HLA-DPB1 , HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQB1 , and HLA-DRB1 class II genes were imputed. Individuals with
more than two undetermined HLA alleles were excluded.

All analyses were performed in R 184 . Associations of HLA alleles with
disease were tested using logistic regressions, adjusting for age, sex, and
principal components as specified above for single variant association
analysis. Only HLA alleles with a frequency higher than 1% were analyzed.
Haplotype estimations and association analyses with disease were performed
using the ‘haplo.glm’ function from the haplo.stats R
package 185 with
age, sex, and principal components as covariates. Analysis was performed on
two-loci and three-loci haplotypes of HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes.
Haplotypes with a frequency below 1% were excluded from the analysis.
Considering the high LD in the MHC region, only haplotypes predicted with
posterior probabilities higher than 0.2 were considered for analysis.
Meta-analysis P values were computed using an
inverse-variance-based model as implemented in METAL software 141 . For haplotypes
analysis, only individuals with no undetermined HLA alleles and only
datasets with more than 100 cases or controls were included. Adjustments on
HLA significant variants and HLA alleles were performed by introducing the
variant or alleles as covariates in the regression models. Adjusted P values were computed using the FDR method and the R
‘p.adjust’ function, and applied to the meta-analysis P values. The FDR threshold was set to 10%.
