Novel tau filament fold in chronic traumatic encephalopathy encloses hydrophobic molecules

# Abstract
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head impacts or exposure to blast waves. First described as punch-drunk syndrome and dementia pugilistica in retired boxers 1 - 3 , CTE has since been identified in former participants of other contact sports, ex-military personnel and following physical abuse 4 - 7 . No disease-modifying therapies exist and diagnosis requires an autopsy. CTE is defined by an abundance of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes around blood vessels 8 , 9 . This, together with the accumulation of tau inclusions in cortical layers II and III, distinguishes CTE from Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies 10 , 11 . However, the morphologies of tau filaments in CTE and the mechanisms by which brain trauma can lead to their formation are unknown. We used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments, with resolutions down to 2.3 Å, from the brains of three individuals with CTE, one American football player and two boxers. We show that filament structures are identical in the three cases, but distinct from those of Alzheimer’s and Pick’s diseases, and from those formed in vitro 12 - 15 . Like in Alzheimer’s disease 12 , 14 , 16 - 18 , all six brain tau isoforms assemble into CTE filaments, and residues K274/S305-R379 form the ordered core of two identical C-shaped protofilaments. However, CTE filaments have novel protofilament interfaces, resulting in different overall morphologies. Moreover, a different conformation of the β-helix region creates a hydrophobic cavity that is absent in tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease brain. This cavity encloses an additional density that is not connected to tau, suggesting that incorporation of cofactors may play a role in tau aggregation in CTE. The tau filament structures presented here provide a unifying neuropathological criterion for CTE, and support the hypothesis that the formation and propagation of distinct conformers of assembled tau underlie different neurodegenerative diseases.

## METHODS
Case 1 of CTE is a retired professional American football player, who died aged 67. Cases 2 and 3 are former professional boxers, who died aged 67 and 78, respectively. Case 1 is documented for the first time, whereas cases 2 and 3 have been described before 5 , 16 , 37 - 40 . Case 1 played football during high school and college, and in over 30 professional matches during the 1970s. He reported a history of at least 30 concussions, 7 of which were accompanied by a loss of consciousness. Case 1 suffered from memory problems for several years and his family noticed an irritable mood and behavioural outbursts. He also reported muscle weakness. He was able to walk a few steps, but was mostly reliant on a wheelchair. Physical examination confirmed a motor neuron-predominant weakness without prominent upper motor signs. The mother of case 1 was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in her 80s. During his footballing career, case 1 used the anabolic steroid methandrostenolone (Dianabol).

Neuropathologically, all three cases had stage 4 CTE 5 , with abundant silver-positive tau inclusions in brain ( Figure 1a-c , Extended Data Figure 1a,b ). By immunoblotting of the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of the temporal cortex, a pattern consistent with the presence of all six brain tau isoforms was observed ( Extended Data Figure 1d ) 16 - 18 . Case 1 also had a small number of AT8-positive inclusions in spinal cord, mostly around blood vessels ( Extended Data Figure 1c ). TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusions were present in spinal cord ( Extended Data Figure 1e ). TDP-43 inclusions and ALS are increased in individuals with CTE 41 , 42 . As described before 5 , 16 , 37 - 39 , case 2 had abundant tau and TDP-43 inclusions in both brain and spinal cord ( Extended Data Figure 1a,c,f ). The inclusions were present in separate cells ( Extended Data Figure 1f , top right-hand panel). The TDP-43 pathology in brain was type B 43 . Dipeptide repeat inclusions (poly-GA) were present in cerebellum ( Extended Data Figure 1f ), prompting the sequencing of C9orf72 . A heterozygous hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion mutation in intron 1 of C9orf72 was detected (more than 145 repeats). Cases 1 and 3 had wild-type numbers of hexanucleotide repeats in both alleles. As mentioned before 37 , case 2 had a sibling with ALS. We conclude that case 2 suffered from inherited frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)/ALS, in addition to CTE. Case 3 had abundant tau inclusions in brain, as reported before 16 , 40 ( Extended Data Figure 1a ). Abundant α-synuclein inclusions were also present in substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, locus coeruleus and several other brain regions, confirming a previous study 40 ( Extended Data Figure 1g ). This individual therefore had CTE and Parkinson’s disease. Clinical and neuropathological comorbidities are common in CTE 44 . The spinal cord of case 3 was not available, but there was no reported clinical or family history of ALS. By immunohistochemistry, abundant Aβ plaques were not observed in any of the three cases.

No known mutations in over 50 genes reported to cause Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, many cases of ALS or frontotemporal dementia were detected in the three cases by next-generation sequencing. The APOE genotypes were: Case 1 (ε2/ε3); case 2 (ε3/ε4); case 3 (ε3/ε3). Case 1 was homozygous, and cases 2 and 3 heterozygous for the TMEM106B variant, rs3173615 (c.554c>g, p.T185S), which has been reported to alter the neuropathology of CTE 45 . Case 1 was heterozygous and case 2 homozygous for the T allele at the RS5848 locus in the 3’-untranslated region of GRN . A C>T substitution occurs more frequently in cases of FTLD-TDP than in controls 46 .

Sarkosyl-insoluble material was extracted from fresh-frozen temporal cortex, as described 17 . Approximately 6 g tissue was used for cryo-EM and 0.6 g for immuno-EM. The pelleted sarkosyl-insoluble material was resuspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 800 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA, with a final concentration of 10% (w/v) sucrose at 750 μl/g, followed by centrifugation at 20,100g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 containing 100 mM NaCl at 250 μl/g and centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellets were resuspended in buffer at 15 μl/g for cryo-EM and 150 μl/g for immuno-EM.

Extracted tau filaments were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Images were acquired on a Gatan K2-Summit detector in counting mode using an FEI Titan Krios at 300 kV. A GIF-quantum energy filter (Gatan) was used with a slit width of 20 eV to remove inelastically scattered electrons. Further details are given in Extended Data Table 1 .

Movie frames were corrected for gain reference, motion-corrected, and dose-weighted using MOTIONCOR2 47 . Aligned, non-dose-weighted micrographs were used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) in Gctf 48 . All subsequent image-processing steps were performed using helical reconstruction methods in RELION 3.0 20 , 49 . Filaments were picked manually; CTE Type I tau filaments and PHF-like tau filaments were subsequently separated by reference-free 2D classification of segments comprising an entire helical crossover (using box sizes of 800 pixels and an inter-box distance of 14 Å). CTE Type I tau filament and PHF-like tau filament segments were re-extracted using box sizes of 270 pixels and an inter-box distance of 14 Å. Reference-free 2D classification was performed and segments contributing to suboptimal 2D class averages discarded. Initial 3D models were constructed de novo from 2D class averages from the case 1 dataset of segments comprising entire helical crossovers, and low-pass filtered to 40 Å.

For CTE type I tau filaments from case 1, 3D auto-refinement with optimisation of the helical twist was performed with a value of 10% for the helical z percentage parameter, before correcting for per-particle beam-induced motion and defoci using Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement, respectively. We then performed 3D classification with local optimisation of helical twist and rise, to remove segments contributing to suboptimal 3D class averages, and further 3D auto-refinement. Following attempted beam-tilt estimation, instead of the axial coma that would be produced by a tilted beam, we observed strong 3-fold astigmatism in the per-Fourier-pixel average phase-error plot ( Extended Data Figure 8 , upper panels). Transmission electron microscopes often exhibit optical aberrations, i.e. unequal phase delays between the waves corresponding to different image frequencies. Those aberrations can always be separated into a symmetrical and an anti-symmetrical component: the symmetrical component gives rise to the CTF, while the anti-symmetrical component induces phase shifts in the complex amplitudes of the observed image. The 3-fold astigmatism that we measured is such an anti-symmetrical aberration. In a development version of RELION, we modelled this using the first 6 anti-symmetrical Zernike polynomials (radial orders 1 and 2), assuming the effect to be constant across the entire data set. The coefficients of the Zernike polynomials were estimated so as to minimise the sum of squared per-pixel differences over all pixels and particles between the predicted and the observed particle images. Expressing the aberration in this way allowed us to demodulate the phases of the particle images and thus to correct for the anti-symmetrical aberration, yielding an improvement in resolution from 2.7 to 2.5 Å. In addition to the anti-symmetrical aberration, we developed a related method to estimate the symmetrical aberrations. We extended the argument of the CTF sine function in RELION by an offset term that was modelled using the first 9 symmetrical Zernike polynomials (radial orders 0, 2 and 4). The coefficients were again estimated so as to minimise the sum of squared differences. Visualisation of the per-Fourier-pixel offset term revealed the presence of 4-fold astigmatism, which cannot be expressed by the traditional CTF model and which deforms the rings of the CTF from the usually elliptical shape to be slightly square-shaped ( Extended Data Figure 8 , lower panels). Correcting for 4-fold astigmatism, combined with a larger box size of 400 pixels, led to a resolution of 2.3 Å. Details of the higher-order aberration correction in RELION will be published elsewhere.

For CTE type I tau filaments from cases 2 and 3, 3D classification with local optimisation of helical twist and rise was performed to remove segments contributing to suboptimal 3D class averages, followed by 3D auto-refinement with optimisation of the helical twist with a value of 10% for the helical z percentage parameter. For the PHF-like tau filaments from case 1, CTE type II tau filaments were separated from PHFs by 3D classification with local optimisation of helical twist and rise. For case 2, 3D classification of the PHF-like tau filaments only identified CTE type II tau filaments. 3D auto-refinement with optimisation of the helical twist with a value of 10% for the helical z percentage parameter was then performed on the separated filaments. PHF-like tau filaments from case 3 did not yield reliable 3D reconstructions.

The final reconstructions were sharpened using the standard post-processing procedures in RELION and helical symmetry was imposed using the RELION helix toolbox 20 . Finally, overall resolution estimates were calculated from Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between two independently refined half-maps, using phase randomization to correct for the convolution effects of a generous, soft-edged solvent mask 50 . Local resolution estimates were obtained using the same-phase randomization procedure, but with a soft spherical mask that was moved over the entire map. For further details, see Extended Data Table 1 .

The two cross-β packing stacks and their linking regions were taken from the Alzheimer’s disease PHF model (PDB accession number 6HRE). The β-helix and its preceding and proceeding regions were built de novo into the 2.3 Å resolution reconstruction of CTE type I tau filaments from case 1 using COOT 51 . Water molecules and generic fused ring compounds (PubChem CID 1107) were added in COOT. The new model was then refined against the CTE type I and type II filament reconstructions from case 1 using targeted real-space refinement in COOT. The models were subsequently translated to give stacks of three consecutive monomers to preserve nearest-neighbour interactions for the middle chains in subsequent Fourier space refinements in REFMAC 52 . Local symmetry restraints were imposed to keep all β-strand rungs identical. Side-chain clashes were detected using MOLPROBITY 53 and corrected by iterative cycles of real-space refinements in COOT and Fourier space refinements in REFMAC. Separate model refinements were performed against single half-maps, and the resulting models compared with the other half-maps to confirm the absence of overfitting. The final models were stable in refinements without additional restraints. Further details are given in Extended Data Table 1 .

Immunogold negative-stain EM was carried out as described 13 . Primary antibodies were BR136 13 (raised against tau residues 244–257), Anti-4R 54 (raised against tau residues 275–291, with D279; Cosmo Bio CAC-TIP-4RT-P01), BR135 55 (raised against tau residues 323–335), and TauC4 56 (raised against tau residues 354–369), all used at 1:50. Images were acquired at 11,000 × , with a defocus value of −1.4 μm with a Gatan Orius SC200B CCD detector using a Tecnai G2 Spirit at 120 kV. To distinguish non-specific background from specific labelling, we only considered filaments with more than six gold beads to be positively labelled.

Immunoblotting was carried out as described 13 . Samples were resolved on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex), and the primary antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Primary antibodies were BR133 55 , used at 1:4,000, BR136 13 , used at 1:1,000, Anti-4R 54 (Cosmo Bio CAC-TIP-4RT-P01), used at 1:2,000, BR135 55 , used at 1:4,000, and TauC4 56 , used at 1:2,000, BR134 55 , used at 1:4,000, and AT8 (specific for pS202/pT205 tau; Thermo Fisher Scientific MN2010), used at 1:1,000.

Histology and immunohistochemistry were carried out as described 57 . Brain sections were 8-μm thick and were counterstained with haematoxylin. Primary antibodies were AT8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific MN1020), used at 1:300, AT100 (specific for pT212/pS214/pT217 tau, Thermo Fisher Scientific MN1060), used at 1:400, Anti-4R 54 (Cosmo Bio CAC-TIP-4RT-P01), used at 1:400, RD3 (Merck 05-803), used at 1:3,000, anti-phospho-TDP-43 (specific for pS409/pS410 TDP-43; Cosmo Bio CAC-TIP-PTD-M01), used at 1:1,000, SYN 58 (specific for α-synuclein residues 119-137), used at 1:300, and anti-poly-GA (Cosmo Bio CAC-TIP-C9-P01), used at 1:300. Sections were silver-impregnated using the method of Gallyas-Braak to visualize inclusions 59 , 60 .

Target enrichment made use of the SureSelectXT human all exon library (V6, 58 Mb, Agilent) and high-throughput sequencing was carried out using a HiSeq4000 (2 × 75 bp paired-end configuration, Illumina). Bioinformatics analyses were performed as described 61 .

Sequencing libraries were prepared using 100 ng high-quality genomic DNA from cerebellum using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit, and assessed using a Qubit and Agilent Bioanalyzer. High-throughput sequencing was carried out on multiple libraries pooled in equal molarity using a NovaSeq6000 (150 bp paired-end configuration, Illumina) and aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38 using BWA and Bwakit (v0.7.15). ExpansionHunter was applied to estimate expansion numbers of short tandem repeats (v2.5.5) and germline variants were identified with Strelka2 (v2.9.9), with default parameters for whole genome sequence data. The variants were annotated for their effects with ANNOVAR 62 .

Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the number of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats in the first intron of C9orf72 (Asuragen AmplideX PCR/CE C9orf72 kit). Internal standards were analyzed along with samples to evaluate assay performance. Up to 25 repeats were determined with an accuracy of +/− 1 repeat and repeat numbers greater than 25 were determined with an accuracy of +/− 3 repeats.
