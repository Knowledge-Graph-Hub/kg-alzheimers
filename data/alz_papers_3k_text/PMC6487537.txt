# Title
Discovery of Volatile Biomarkers of Parkinson’s
Disease from Sebum

# Abstract
 Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative
disease that presents with significant motor symptoms, for which there
is no diagnostic chemical test. We have serendipitously identified
a hyperosmic individual, a “Super Smeller” who can detect
PD by odor alone, and our early pilot studies have indicated that
the odor was present in the sebum from the skin of PD subjects. Here,
we have employed an unbiased approach to investigate the volatile
metabolites of sebum samples obtained noninvasively from the upper
back of 64 participants in total (21 controls and 43 PD subjects).
Our results, validated by an independent cohort ( n =31), identified a distinct volatiles-associated signature of PD,
including altered levels of perillic aldehyde and eicosane, the smell
of which was then described as being highly similar to the scent of
PD by our “Super Smeller”.

## Background
Physicians in ancient
times, including Hippocrates, Galenus, and
Avicenna, used odor as a diagnostic tool. Although the olfactory skills
of physicians are not routinely used in modern medicine, it is well
documented that a number of conditions, predominantly metabolic and
infectious diseases, are associated with a unique odor, 1 but there is scant evidence for odors as symptoms
of neurodegenerative disorders. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study that demonstrates the use of sebum as biofluid
to screen for Parkinson’s disease (PD). There have been a small
number of metabolomics studies of PD using various biofluids such
as blood, feces, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as
insect and mouse models of PD as described in this recent review by
Shao and Le; 2 there is no mention of a
“PD odor”. Joy Milne, a Super Smeller whose husband
Les was diagnosed with PD in 1986, has demonstrated a unique ability
to detect PD by odor. 3 Joy has an extremely
sensitive sense of smell, and this enables her to detect and discriminate
odors not normally detected by those of average olfactory ability.
Preliminary tests with T-shirts and medical gauze indicated the odor
was present in areas of high sebum production, namely, the upper back
and forehead, and not present in armpits. 3 Sebum is a waxy, lipid-rich biofluid excreted by the sebaceous glands
in the skin, overproduction of which known as seborrhea, is a
known non-motor symptom of PD. 4 , 5 PD skin has recently
been shown to contain phosphorylated α-synuclein, a molecular
hallmark of PD. 6 , 7 Identification and quantification
of the compounds that are associated with this distinctive PD odor
could enable rapid, early screening of PD as well as provide insights
into molecular changes that occur as the disease progresses and enable
stratification of the disease in the future.

Volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) are often associated with characteristic
odors, although some volatiles may also be odorless. The term “volatilome”
describes the entirety of the volatile organic and inorganic compounds
that may originate from any organism, or object, which may be analytically
characterized. For any given sample under ambient conditions in a
confined environment, collecting, identifying, and measuring molecules
in its headspace will then define its volatilome. Such measurements
can be performed with thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (TD–GC–MS), where a sample is placed in
a closed vessel. The sample is then heated to encourage the production
of volatiles, and the headspace is captured for analysis by GC–MS.
Investigation of volatile metabolites using mass spectrometry has
proven to be extremely useful in clinical studies 8 − 11 as well as in the analysis of
the consistency and provenance of edible items. 12 − 14 Recently, TD-GC-MS
has been used as a volatilome analysis platform for the detection
of compounds from bacteria implicated in ventilator associated pneumonia, 10 for differentiation between odors due to human
and animal decomposition, 15 as well as
aerosol detection of the fumes from e-cigarettes. 16 This versatility of TD-GC-MS for samples from many sources
renders it highly suitable for use in identifying the metabolites
that give rise to the distinct scent of PD. We have established a
workflow that starts in clinics with the collections of sebum samples
from the upper backs of PD patients along with matched control subjects
and progresses to the discovery of disease specific volatile metabolites,
the odor of which is confirmed by our Super Smeller ( Figure 1 , Supporting Information and Table S1A ).

Schematic outline of the workflow described
in this study - from
sample collection to biomarker discovery. Parkinson’s disease
patient samples and control participant samples were collected from
25 sites across the UK using gauze swabs to sample the sebum from
the top back region from 64 people. Thermal desorption–gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC–MS) analysis
was performed alongside olfactory analysis, results of which were
then combined. Statistical analysis was performed on two independent
cohorts. Data from discovery cohort consisting of 30 participants
were used to create a partial least-squares-discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA) model, and differential features found as a result were then
targeted for the presence in a separate validation cohort consisting
of 31 participants. The significance of these biomarkers was tested
using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney
test. Finally, four features that showed similar statistical significance
and expression in both cohorts were selected for biological interpretation
of data.

In the current study, VOCs from
the sample headspace were measured
in two cohorts: a “discovery” cohort ( n = 30) and a “validation” cohort ( n =
31), to validate discovered biomarkers 17 (for demographics of each cohort see Tables S1B and S5 ). A third cohort consisting of three drug-naïve
PD participants was used for GC-MS analysis in conjunction with a
human Super Smeller via an odor port ( Figure 1 ). This proof of principal study provides
the first description of the skin volatilome in PD compared to control
subjects.

## Study Participants
The participants for this study
were part of a nationwide recruitment
process taking place at 25 different NHS clinics. The participants
for this study were selected at random from these sites. The study
was performed in three stages. The first two stages (discovery and
validation) consisted of 61 samples (a mixture of control, PD participants
on medication, and drug naïve PD subjects as shown in Table S1B ). The first cohort was used for volatilome
discovery, and the second cohort was used to validate the significant
features discovered in first cohort. A third cohort consisting of
three drug naïve PD participants was used for smell analysis
from the Super Smeller. Ethical approval for this project (IRAS project
ID 191917) was obtained by the NHS Health Research Authority (REC
reference: 15/SW/0354). The metadata analysis for these participants
is reported in Table S1B . The study design
was as outlined in Figure 1 .

## Sample Collection
The sampling involved each subject
being swabbed on the upper back
with a medical gauze. The gauze with sebum sample from the participant’s
upper back was sealed in background-inert plastic bags and transported
to the central facility at the University of Manchester, where they
were stored at −80 °C until the date of analysis.

A dynamic headspace (DHS)
GC–MS method was developed for the analysis of gauze swabs
which contained sampled participant sebum. DHS is a sample preparation
capability for subsequent GC application using the GERSTEL MultiPurpose
sampler (MPS) that concentrates VOCs from liquid or solid samples.
The sample is incubated while the headspace is purged with a controlled
flow of inert gas through an adsorbent tube. Once extraction and preconcentration
are completed, the adsorbent tube is automatically desorbed using
the GERSTEL thermal desorption unit (TDU). Analytes are then cryofocused
on the GERSTEL cool injection system (CIS) programmed temperature
vaporizer (PTV) injector before being transferred to the GC for analysis.

In order to correlate the PD molecular signature to the PD smell,
the same setup was used in combination with the GERSTEL olfactory
detection port (ODP). The ODP allows detection of odorous compounds
as they elute from the GC, by smell. In fact, the gas flow is
split as it leaves the column between the detector of choice (in our
case MS) and the ODP to allow simultaneous detection on the two analytical
tools. The additional smell profile information can then be acquired
as an olfactogram. Voice recognition software and intensity registration
allow direct annotation of the chromatogram.

Gauze swabs were transferred into 20
mL headspace vials and then analyzed by DHS–TD–GC–MS.
For the DHS preconcentration step, samples were incubated for 5 min
at 60 °C before proceeding with the trapping step. Trapping was
performed by purging 500 mL of the sample headspace at 50 mL·min –1 through a Tenax TA adsorbent tube kept at 40 °C
(GERSTEL, Germany). Dry nitrogen was used as the purge gas. To
release the analytes, the adsorbent trap was desorbed in the TDU in
splitless mode. The TDU was kept at 30 °C for 1 min then ramped
at 12 °C·s –1 to 250 °C and held for
5 min. Desorbed analytes were cryofocused in the CIS injector. The
CIS was operated in solvent vent mode, using a vent flow of 80 mL·min –1 and applying a split ratio of 10. The initial temperature
was kept at 10 °C for 2 min, then ramped at 12 °C·s –1 to 250 °C and held for 10 min. The GC analysis
was performed on an Agilent GC 7890B coupled to an Agilent MSD 5977B
equipped with high efficiency source (HES) operating in EI mode. Separation
was achieved on an Agilent HP-5MS Ultra inert 30 m × 0.25 mm
× 0.25 μm column. The column flow was kept at 1 mL·min –1 . The oven ramp was programmed as follows: 40 °C
held for 5 min, 10 °C·min –1 to 170 °C,
8 °C·min –1 to 250 °C, 10 °C·min –1 to 260 °C held for 2 min for a total run time
of 31 min. The transfer line to the MS was kept at 300 °C. The
HES source was kept at 230 °C and the Quadrupole at 150 °C.
The MSD was operated in scan mode for the mass range between 30 and
800 m / z . For the olfactometry approach,
the chromatographic flow was split between the mass spectrometer and
the GERSTEL olfactory detection port (ODP3) using Agilent Technologies
Capillary Flow Technology (three-way splitter plate equipped with
makeup gas). The ODP3 transfer line was kept at 100 °C, and humidity
of the nose cone was maintained constant.

TD–GC–MS
data were converted to open source mzXML format using ProteoWizard.
Each cohort data set was deconvolved separately using eRah package
for R. 18 Upon deconvolution, in discovery
cohort 207 features and in validation cohort 210 features were assigned
to detected peaks. The deconvolved analytes were assigned putative
identifications by matching fragment spectra with compound spectra
present in the Golm database, NIST library, and Fiehn GCMS library.
In discovery cohort 163 features were assigned a putative identification,
and in validation cohort 156 features were assigned a putative identification.
The resulting matrices for each cohort consisted of variables and
their respective area under the peak for each sample. All data were
normalized for age and total ion count to account for confounding
variables ( Table S1B ).

The discovery cohort data analysis included
a global analysis of all the detected compounds. PLS-DA modeling was
carried out using all the measured features. We have not included
PCA results because, using this unsupervised clustering method, we
were unable to see any clustering of data. We attribute this to the
complex nature of metabolomics data especially for volatile metabolites.
This results in high dimensionality of the data, and it is unrealistic
to expect that the separation between PD and controls is the most
dominating variance in the data and thus results in poorer display
on PCA/MDS plots. Often supervised modeling is required to train the
models to find defined differences by overcoming noise.

The
data were log10-scaled, and Pareto scaled prior to Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney
analysis, PLS-DA, and the production of ROC curves. The PLS-DA modeling was
performed and executed using MATLAB (2018a), 19 , 20 and the MATLAB functions are freely available from our in-house
cluster toolbox hosted at https://github.com/biospec . ROC curves were generated using the R package called pROC. 21 The samples from both cohorts were also analysed
together combined as a single dataset, thus increasing sample
size and providing better statistical power while evaluating the performance
of this panel of biomarkers ( Figure 2 c, Figure S1 ). ROC curves
were generated by Monte Carlo cross validations (MCCV) using balanced
subsampling. In each of the MCCV, two-thirds of the samples were used
to evaluate the feature importance. The top two, three, five, seven,
and nine important features were then used to build classification
models, which were validated using the remaining one-third of the
samples. The process was repeated 500 times to calculate the average
performance and confidence interval of each model. Classification
and feature ranking were performed using a PLS-DA algorithm using
two latent variables ( Figure 2 c).

PLS–DA modeling was further tested using permutation tests
(where the output classification was randomized; n = 28), and results were plotted as a histogram which showed frequency
distribution of correct classification rate (CCR) which yielded CCRs
ranging between 0.4 and 0.9 for permutated models. The observed model
was significantly better than most of the permuted models ( p < 0.1), shown by the red arrow. (c) ROC plot generated
using combined samples from both cohorts and the panel of four metabolites
that was common and differential between control and PD. The shaded
blue area indicates 95% confidence intervals calculated by Monte Carlo
cross validation (MCCV) using balanced subsampling with multiple repeats.

When performing k -nearest neighbors analysis, k was chosen to be
5 given the small sample size, and the
distance parameter used was Euclidean distance which was used as weights
such that closer neighbors of a query point have a greater influence
than the neighbors farther away. During random forest analysis of
the same data, 10 decision trees were grown, and the growth control
was achieved by not splitting into subsets smaller than five. The
SVM model was built using LIBSVM, implemented in e1071 package of
R, 22 with a linear kernel. The cost ( C ) and regression loss epsilon (∈) were determined
by performing a grid search and were set at C = 10
and ∈ was set at 0.10.

No unexpected or
unusually high safety
hazards were encountered in the course of this work.

## Results
and Discussion
A partial least-squares discriminant analysis
(PLS–DA) model
was built using the discovery cohort data ( Figure 2 ). The classification accuracy of this model
was validated by a bootstrapping approach ( n = 1000).
The variables contributing to classification ( n =
17) were selected using variable importance in projections (VIP) scores
where VIP > 1. We note at this stage that one of the 17 metabolites
found is 3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid, a metabolite of norepinephrine
in humans. This catechol is also a metabolite of L-dopa, one of the
most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson’s. In this
study, 3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid is observed in both drug naïve
participants and control participants, indicating its presence may
originate from endogenous mandelic acid instead of PD drugs. Norepinephrines
including 3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid are key molecules in the anabolism
of brain neurotransmitters. Changes in neurons and neurotransmitters
are an extremely well-known characterization of PD; 23 for instance, the decrease of dopamines, a precursor to
3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid, is a known characterization of PD. It
could, therefore, be hypothesized that the presence of endogenous
3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid could be indicative of altered levels
of neurotransmitters in PD.

The measured volatilome in the validation
cohort data (from a different
population than the discovery cohort) was targeted for the presence
or absence of these discovered biomarkers. Out of these 17 metabolites,
13 were also found in the validation cohort data, and nine of
these had retention times that allowed us to confidently assign them
as identical ( Table S2 ). These nine biomarkers
found in both cohorts were selected for further analysis and statistical
testing. To evaluate the performance of these biomarkers, we conducted
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses with data from both
the discovery cohort and the validation cohort ( Figure S1 ). ROC curves and Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney tests
as well as fold-change calculations on individual metabolites shows
four out of these nine metabolites had a similar trend in regulation
between the discovery and validation cohorts, and their performance
was also similar as measured by AUC ( Table 1 , Figure 3 ). The results from the combined analysis using both
cohorts as a single experiment indicate increased confidence in the
data ( p- values in Table 1 , confidence intervals in Figure S1 ).

(red) cohort for four analytes common to both experiments. Confidence
intervals were computed with 2000 stratified bootstrap replicates,
and diagonal black line represents random guess. Box plots show comparison
of means of log scaled peak intensities of these analytes, where black
dots were outliers.

Perillic aldehyde and Eicosane
were significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in PD, respectively
(FDR corrected p < 0.05) in both cohorts.

We adhered to the Metabolomics Standards
Initiative (MSI) guidelines
for data analysis and for assignment of identity to features of interest, 17 and all identified features are at MSI level
two, which means these are putatively annotated compounds (i.e. without
chemical reference standards, based upon physicochemical properties
and/or spectral similarity with public/commercial spectral libraries).
The compounds perillic aldehyde and eicosane are significantly different
between PD and control in both the cohorts ( p <
0.05): perillic aldehyde was observed to be lower in PD samples, whereas
eicosane was observed at significantly higher levels. Although hippuric
acid and octadecanal were not significantly different ( p > 0.05), the AUC and box plots ( Figure 3 ) between the two cohorts were comparable
and showed similar trends of being increased in PD. Previous studies
have reported varying abundances of these compounds in other biofluids
( Table 2 ).

Using an odor port attached to the GC–MS
instrument, the
Super Smeller identified times at which any smell was present and
also more importantly the times at which a specific “musky”
smell of PD was detected. Data were presented in the form of an olfactogram,
where the presence and relative intensity of each smell were recorded
at its corresponding chromatographic retention time. Olfactogram results
obtained from the odor port were overlaid on the respective total
ion chromatogram from GC–MS ( Figure 4 A). There was significant overlap between
regions that contained up-regulated compounds and regions in which
a smell similar or identical to that of PD scent was present. In the
chromatographic trace the region between 19 and 21 min is of particular
interest ( Figure 4 B)
since the smell associated with the mixture of analytes in that window
was described as “very strong” and “musky”.
This is the same region where three compounds, viz. hippuric acid, eicosane, and octadecanal, have been detected in
both cohorts, and all three were found to be up-regulated in PD subjects.

Comparison
of GC–MS chromatogram to description of olfactory
data described by the Super Smeller: GC–MS chromatogram from
three drug naïve Parkinson’s subjects and a blank gauze.
(A) The 10–25 min retention time range of the chromatographic
analysis in which the Super Smeller described various odors associated
with different GC–MS peaks. The overlaid green shaded area
shows the overlap between real time GC–MS analysis and the
Super Smeller describing a “strong PD smell” via the odor port. (B) A zoom of the green highlighted area
from A. This region is of particular interest as three out of four
identified compounds are found here ( Tables 1 and S2 ); it encompasses
the time during which the Super Smeller described a musky PD-like
scent as being “very strong” (between the time lines
at 19 and 21 min) for the PD samples and not for the blank. It can
be noted that none of these compounds are found in blank gauze (bottom
chromatogram) within the same retention time window as shown by normalized
relative peak intensities to the highest peak in each chromatogram.
The area between black dotted lines highlights the presence of compounds
in PD samples but complete absence in the blank gauze.

In order to validate mass spectrometry led biomarkers
and to verify
the resultant scent, the candidate compounds listed in Table S2 ( n = 17) were purchased
and spiked onto gauze swabs ( Table S3 ).
An exploratory study with our Super Smeller was performed in which
multiple mixtures of compounds ( n = 5) were spiked
onto both blank gauze swabs and swabs that contained control sebum.
Two final dispensed volumes of the mixtures were tested (40 and 100
μL), and all compounds used were at a single concentration (10
μM). In these blinded tests, the Super Smeller grouped the samples
in order of PD-like odor. She was able to isolate the swabs with a
sebum background matrix and described them as more familiar to the
PD-like smell than without control sebum. Further tests utilized control
sebum as a background matrix for spiking candidate compounds, and
a range of concentrations was then selected for testing. Mixtures
of the candidate compounds ( n = 17) were prepared
at a range of concentrations (10 μM, 5 μM, 0.5 μM,
0.05 μM, 0.005 μM) and presented to the Super Smeller
in a second blinded test; she was again asked to rank in order of
PD-like smell. These results demonstrated she could detect (although
not in any systematic order) the whole range of concentrations offered,
and a concentration between 0.05 μM and 0.5 μM gave her
the best response. A validation study consisting of three compound
mixtures with significance from the MS analysis aimed to distinguish
the combination that best gave rise to the most PD-like smell. Three
mixture combinations were chosen at a single concentration (0.5 μM):
all candidate compounds ( n = 17), all compounds identified
in both the discovery and validation cohorts ( n = 9), and the panel of compounds expressed in same direction and differential
between PD and control ( n = 4). The mixture of nine
compounds was consistently described as being most akin to the PD-like
odor and was slightly overlapped by description and rank with the
mixture of four compounds. The mixture of 17 compounds was grouped
as the same “smell” as the other two combinations; however
they were described as significantly weaker. We hypothesize this is
due to a lower concentration of each compound in the mixture and thus
higher interference from background solvent smell. The results from
these tests are depicted in Figure S2 whereby
the intensity and correlation to the PD-like smell partition the groups
of samples tested. We do not conclude that these chemicals alone constitute
the unique smell associated with PD; rather, we demonstrate that they
contribute to it.

From results obtained from three independent
sets of data, from
different people with one underlying factor (i.e., PD) separating
them, it was clear that several volatile features were found to be
significantly different between control and PD participants. There
were no significant differences observed between PD participants on
medication and drug naïve PD participants ( p > 0.05 for all measured volatiles), indicating that the majority
of the analyzed volatilome and by inference sebum are unlikely to
contain drug metabolites associated with PD medication. In addition,
applying machine learning approaches such as k -nearest
neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines (SVM) did not
lead to a classification between drug naïve PD participants
and PD participants on medication (results in Table S4 ).

Perillic aldehyde and octadecanal are ordinarily
observed as plant
metabolites or food additives. It can be hypothesized that with increased
and altered sebum secretion such lipid-like hydrophobic metabolites
may be better captured or retained on the sebum-rich skin of PD subjects.
Skin disorders in PD have been observed previously, and seborrheic
dermatitis (SD) in particular has been flagged as a premotor feature
of PD. 23 It has been reported by Arsenijevic
and co-workers 5 that PD patients who suffer
from SD have increased Malassezia spp. density
on their skin and commensurate higher lipase activity required metabolically
by yeast. This increased lipase activity could correlate with the
enhanced production of eicosane, perillic aldehyde, and octadecanal
as highly lipophilic molecules since Malassezia spp. requires
specific exogenous lipids for growth. Eicosane is reported as being
produced by Streptomyces spp. as an antifungal agent 24 which also supports its increased presence on
the skin of PD sufferers. The effects observed in our study could
also signal altered microbial activity on the skin of PD patients
that may affect the skin microflora resulting inchanges in the
production of metabolites such as hippuric acid. 25 These potential explanations for the change in odor in
PD patients suggest a change in skin microflora and skin physiology
that is highly specific to PD.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our study
highlights the potential of comprehensive
analysis of sebum from PD patients and raises the possibility that
individuals can be screened noninvasively based on targeted analysis
for these volatile biomarkers. We do acknowledge that the current
study is limited with smaller sample size, but the power of this study
is a different validation cohort that consisted of
completely different participants. This validation cohort was able
to verify the findings and classification model built using data from
our discovery cohort. A larger study with extended olfactory data
from human smellers as well as canine smellers in addition to headspace
analyses is the next step in further characterizing the PD sebum volatilome.
This will enable the establishment of a panel of volatile biomarkers
associated with PD and will open new avenues for stratification as
well as facilitate earlier detection of PD and further the understanding
of disease mechanisms.
