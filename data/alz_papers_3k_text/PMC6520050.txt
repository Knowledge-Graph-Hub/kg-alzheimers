Poly(GR) impairs protein translation and stress granule dynamics inC9orf72-associated frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

# Abstract
The major genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a C9orf72 G 4 C 2 repeat expansion 1 , 2 . Proposed mechanisms by which the expansion causes c9FTD/ALS include toxicity from repeat-containing RNA and from dipeptide repeat proteins translated from these transcripts. To investigate the contribution of poly(GR) dipeptide repeat proteins to c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis in a mammalian in vivo model, we generated mice that expressed GFP-(GR) 100 in the brain. GFP-(GR) 100 mice developed age-dependent neurodegeneration, brain atrophy, and motor and memory deficits through the accumulation of diffuse, cytoplasmic poly(GR). Poly(GR) co-localized with ribosomal subunits and the translation initiation factor eIF3η in GFP-(GR) 100 mice and, of importance, in c9FTD/ALS patients. Combined with the differential expression of ribosome-associated genes in GFP-(GR) 100 mice, these findings demonstrate poly(GR)-mediated ribosomal distress. Indeed, poly(GR) inhibited canonical and non-canonical protein translation in HEK293T cells, and also induced the formation of stress granules and delayed their disassembly. These data suggest that poly(GR) contributes to c9FTD/ALS by impairing protein translation and stress granule dynamics, consequently causing chronic cellular stress and preventing cells from mounting an effective stress response. Decreasing poly(GR) and/or interrupting interactions between poly(GR) and ribosomal and stress granule-associated proteins may thus represent potential therapeutic strategies to restore homeostasis.

The (GR) 100 plasmid was generated as previously described 37 . A DNA fragment coding for 50 GR dipeptides was synthesized by GeneArt and used as a template in PCR reactions to generate two fragments of 50 GR dipeptides. These contained either a HindIII site at the 5′ end and a BsmBI site at the 3′ end, or a BsmBI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. BsmBI is a Type IIS restriction enzyme that recognizes an asymmetric DNA sequence and cleaves outside of its recognition sequence, allowing for seamless sub-cloning of DNA coding sequences. These fragments were cloned into HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP–C1 (Clontech Laboratories). The pEGFP–C1–(GR) 100 plasmid was digested using HindIII and BamHI, and then the HindIII–GR100–BamHI DNA fragment was sub-cloned into a modified AAV packaging vector (pAM/CBA-pl-WPRE-BGH (‘pAAV’)) containing the CMV-enhanced chicken β-actin promoter and the EGFP coding sequence with a multiple cloning site that allows for cloning the (GR) 100 fragment in frame with the EGFP coding sequence. The sequence of all plasmids was verified by sequence analysis. The sequence of GFP–(GR) 100 is shown in Supplementary Table 1 .

All procedures using mice were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol numbers A42014 and A47214).

Intracerebroventricular injections of AAV1–GFP–(GR) 100 virus in post-natal day 0 (P0) C57BL/6J pups were performed as previously described using 2 μl (1 × 10 10 genomes μl –1 ) of AAV1–GFP, AAV1–GFP–(GR) 100 , AAV9–(G 4 C 2 ) 2 , AAV9–(G 4 C 2 ) 66 or AAV9–(G 4 C 2 ) 149 solution per cerebral ventricle 27 , 32 .

Three- and six-month-old mice expressing GFP (n = 15) or GFP–(GR) 100 ( n = 12) were subjected to behavioral analysis on two consecutive weeks by the Mayo Mouse Behavior Core. On five consecutive days of week 1, the mice were subjected to the open-field assay on day 1, contextual and cued fear-conditioning tests on days 2 and 3, and the rod walk and wire hang tests on day 4 and 5, respectively. On four consecutive days of week 2, the mice underwent a rotarod test. All mice were acclimated to the room 1 h before testing, and then returned to their home cage and home room after each test.

The open-field test, context and cue fear-conditioning tests, and rotarod test were performed as described previously 27 , 32 . For the open-field test, each mouse was placed in a box and behavioral activity was recorded and tracked for 10 min using an automated camera tracking system, and then analyzed using Anymaze software. For context and cue fear-conditioning, on day 1, each mouse was placed into the chamber and baseline freezing behavior was recorded during the first 2 min. Then, mice were exposed to white noise as the conditioned stimulus, and subsequently received a mild foot shock as the unconditioned stimulus. On day 2, each mouse was returned to the test chamber and freezing behavior was recorded for 5 min (context test). Afterwards, each mouse was placed in a modified chamber, and then exposed to the auditory conditioned stimulus and freezing behavior was recorded for another 3 min (cue test). Baseline freezing behavior obtained during training was subtracted from the context or cue tests to control for variability in each animal. For the rotarod test, each mouse was habituated to stay on the spindle with slow constant speed for 1 min, and then the spindle was accelerated from 4 r.p.m. to 40 r.p.m. The latency to fall time was recorded when the mouse fell off the spindle.

The apparatus consists of a narrow rod (60 cm long, 0.75 cm wide) that was suspended between 2 poles 40 cm above a layer of bedding material to prevent injury to the animal when it falls. Each mouse was gently lowered onto the rod and allowed to stabilize footing before being released. The ability of the mouse to navigate the rod within 5 min was measured. During the test, if a mouse fell down it was returned to the rod, and the total number of falls was counted.

The apparatus consists of a wire (55 cm wide, 2 mm thick) secured tightly to two vertical stands. The wire is maintained 35 cm above a layer of bedding material to prevent injury to the mouse when it falls. Each mouse was picked up by the tail and brought close to the wire so they could grip the wire with their forelimbs. The ability of the animal to suspend itself on the rod was measured for 2 min. If a mouse fell during these 2 min, it was returned to the wire, and the total number of falls was counted.

Sagittal half-brains were immersion-fixed in 10% formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm thick) and then mounted on glass slides for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining. The cortex and hippocampus of the other half-brain were dissected and frozen on dry ice. Frozen mouse cortex and hippocampus, or frozen human post-mortem cerebellum, were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) with 2 × protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Homogenates were used for RNA or protein extractions.

To prepare protein lysates, Triton X-100 and 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were added to the homogenates at a final concentration of 1% and 2%, respectively. Homogenates were sonicated on ice, and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were saved and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Post-mortem cerebellar and frontal cortical tissues from FTD and ALS patients with or without C9orf72 repeat expansion were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Florida Brain Bank. Information on human patients is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Written informed consent was obtained before study entry from all subjects or their legal next of kin if they were unable to give written consent, and biological samples were obtained with Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approval.

Paraffin sections of mouse and human brain were subjected to immunohistochemical staining as previously described 27 , 32 . Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, steamed for 30 min in distilled H 2 O, incubated with Dako Peroxidase Block for 5 min, blocked with Dako All Purpose Blocker for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody for 45 min ( Supplementary Table 1 ). After washing, sections stained with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit primary antibodies were incubated for 30 min in Dako Envision-Plus anti-mouse or anti-rabbit labeled HRP polymer, respectively. For anti-goat TIA-1 staining, sections were incubated for 15 min in anti-goat probe, and then for 15 min in anti-goat labeled HRP polymer. Peroxidase labeling was visualized with the chromogen solution 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB-Plus). Sections were counterstained with Lerner 1 hematoxylin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and coverslipped with Cytoseal mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Aperio ePathology technology (Leica Biosystems) was used to quantify neuropathology as previously described 27 , 32 . High-resolution digitized images of immunostained slides were obtained using a ScanScope AT2 (Leica Biosystems). The distribution patterns of poly(GR) staining in c9FTD/ALS cases were quantified manually, and calculated as the percentage of poly(GR)-positive cells with diffuse poly(GR), poly(GR) inclusions or a combination of both staining types.

Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of mice were quantified in a blinded fashion. Using the ruler function of ImageScope software (v12.1; Leica Biosystems), a line totaling 10 mm along the Purkinje cell layer was delineated for each mouse. The number of Purkinje cells within this distance was counted. Data were presented as the average number of Purkinje cells per 1 mm within each cohort. To quantify the NeuN-positive neuronal density, and percentage of Gfap and Iba1 burden in a blinded fashion, the whole cortex was annotated on mid-sagittal serial sections stained for NeuN, Gfap or Iba1 from each mouse using ImageScope software. The rounded appearance and staining intensity of NeuN-positive neurons was used to design a custom-designed nuclear algorithm. A NeuN-positive neuronal density measure was calculated as the total number of neurons in the annotated area. Gfap-positive astrocytes and Iba1-positive microglia were quantified using custom-designed positive pixel count algorithms. The number of positively stained pixels as a proportion of all pixels was used as the output parameter for both Gfap and Iba1 in the annotated area. The numbers of NeuN-positive cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord were counted manually. The NeuN staining was also used to rate the severity of hippocampal CA1–CA3 neuronal loss using a four-point scale: none (0: no neuronal loss), mild (1: slightly disrupted neuronal layers of CA1–CA3 region), moderate (2: medium loss of neuronal layers), severe (3: extensive loss of neurons). To quantify GFP-positive cells in various neuroanatomical regions of mid-sagittal sections stained for GFP, the motor cortex, hippocampal CA1–CA3 regions and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer for each mouse were delineated using ImageScope software. The number of GFP-positive cells and hematoxylin-stained nuclei (for a count of total cells) were manually counted, and the percentage of GFP-positive was calculated for each region.

Paraffin sections (5 μm) of mouse and human brains were subjected to immunofluorescence staining, as described previously 27 , 32 . Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, steamed for 30 min in Dako antigen retrieval solution, blocked with Dako All Purpose Blocker for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody ( Supplementary Table 1 ). After washing, sections were incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated donkey anti-species (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 2 h. Hoechst 33258 (1 |agml −1 , Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to stain cellular nuclei. Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope.

To extract total RNA in mouse brain, one volume of brain homogenate was mixed with three volumes of Trizol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and frozen on dry ice. One day later, total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, combined with an in-column DNase I digestion step. To extract total RNA from cultured cells, cell pellets were lysed in the TRI Reagent and then total RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). cDNA was obtained after RT-PCR using 1,000 ng of RNA with random primers and the High Capacity cDNA Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

To quantify RNA levels of the indicated transcripts in mouse brain or cultured cells, qPCR was conducted in triplicate for all samples using SYBR green assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Relative RNA expression of Gfap and Iba1, as well as C9–66R, was normalized to Gapdh or GAPDH values, an endogenous transcript control.

The library preparation and RNA-Seq was performed by the Mayo Clinic Sequencing Core Facility (Rochester, MN) as previously described 38 . In brief, a total of 200 ng of RNA in a 50 μl volume was used for preparation of paired-end sequencing libraries using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina). Afterward, samples were subjected to quality control, cluster generation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The reads were de-multiplexed and converted to FASTQ format using CASAVA software from Illumina by the Mayo Clinic Bioinformatics Core (Rochester, MN). Alignment and QC were performed using the latest version of Mayo Clinic’s Map-RSeq (v. 1.2.1.5) RNA-Seq pipeline 39 .

Transcript counts were normalized using conditional quantile normalization for transcript length and GC content 40 . We then normalized for hippocampal and cortical brain weight to account for cell death between GFP and GFP–(GR) 100 mice. We then tested for differential expression between the GFP and GFP–(GR) 100 mice using a two-sided Wald test in DESeq2 41 , after performing the regularized logarithm (rlog) transformation. We used a strict FDR < 0.01. We followed up with a WGCNA 42 and Gene Ontology over-representation test to provide biologically meaningful context for gene sets using only the significantly differentially expressed genes. To make WGCNA modules as specific as possible, we set WGCNA ‘mergeCutHeight’ to 0.01. Clusters were made using ‘pheatmap’ in R (v. 3.4.1) with Euclidean clustering distance. Complete results for differentially expressed genes and WGCNA module associations are available in Supplementary Data Set 1 . Differentially expressed gene P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (also known as the FDR). WGCNA module associations to genotype were tested using Pearson correlation, and P values were adjusted using the Holm procedure. All data with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

HEK293T cells were grown in Opti-Mem plus 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. To examine nascent translated proteins, SUnSET assays were performed as previously described 29 . In brief, cells grown in 6-well plates or on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 μg (6-well plates) or 0.3 μg (24-well plates) of an expression vector (GFP, GFP–(GR) 100 or GFP–(GA) 100 ) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μg ml –1 puromycin. After 1 h, cells were collected for western blot analysis and fixed for immunofluorescence staining. To determine the effect of poly(GR) on RAN translation, cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg C9–66R and 1 μg of either GFP or GFP–(GR) 100 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 48 h, cells were collected for western blot analysis. To determine the effect of poly(GR) on RNA foci formation, cells grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg C9–66R and 0.25 μg GFP or GFP–(GR) 100 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 48 h, cells were fixed for RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

The in vivo SUnSET assay was performed by stereotaxic intracerebroventricular administration of puromycin into the brain of mice. In brief, 1.5-month-old GFP–(GR) 100 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction, 1–2% for maintenance). Using sterile instruments and gloves, a midsagittal longitudinal incision was made in the scalp to expose the skull. Then, 10 μl of puromycin at a concentration of 1 μg μl –1 was administrated per hemibrain using the following coordinates: 0 mm anterior/posterior (anterior to bregma), 1.0 mm to the right or left medial/lateral and 1.9 mm dorsal/ventral. One hour post-injection, the mice were collected and brains were immersion-fixed in 10% formalin for further immunofluorescence staining.

To prepare cell lysates for SUnSET studies, cell pellets were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease and phosphatase inhibitors), sonicated on ice and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were saved as cell lysates. To prepare cell lysates for poly(GP) immunoassays, cell pellets were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM Nad, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA) plus 2% SDS, and both protease and phosphatase inhibitors, sonicated on ice and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were saved as cell lysates. The protein concentration of lysates was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and samples were then subjected to western blot or immunoassay analyses.

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal horse serum or 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C ( Supplementary Table 1 ). After washing, the cells were incubated with the corresponding Alexa Fluor 568- or 633-conjugated donkey anti-species secondary antibodies (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 2 h. Hoechst 33258 (1 μg ml –1 , Life Technologies) was used to stain cellular nuclei. Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope. To quantify the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic diffuse or aggregated GFP–(GR) 100 , the number of GFP-positive cells containing diffuse or aggregated GFP was counted in a blinded fashion from three independent experiments (~180–350 cells were counted per experiment for the 24 h time point, and ~170–500 cells per experiment were counted for the 48 h time point). To quantify the percentage of GFP- or GFP–(GR) 100 -expressing cells containing TIA-1-positive stress granules under basal conditions, the number of GFP-positive cells with or without TIA-I aggregates was counted in a blinded fashion from three independent experiments (~210–340 cells were counted per experiment for the 24 h time point, and ~250–460 cells per experiment were counted for the 48 h time point). To quantify the percentage of cells with TIA-1-positive stress granules under heat stress and recovery conditions, the number of GFP-positive cells with or without TIA-I aggregates was counted in a blinded fashion from three independent experiments (~200–300 cells per experiment were counted per treatment).

Western blot analysis was performed as previously described 32 , 37 . In brief, lysates were diluted with 2 × SDS-loading buffer at a 1:1 ratio (v/v), and then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Afterward, equal amounts of protein were loaded into 12-well or 20-well 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). After transferring proteins to membranes, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h, and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-puromycin antibody (MABE342, 1:2,000, EMD Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (A-6455, 1:4,000, Life Technologies), rabbit polyclonal anti-GA antibody 37 , rabbit polyclonal anti-GP antibody 11 or mouse monoclonal GAPDH antibody (H86504M, 1:10,000, Meridian Life Science) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Protein expression was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence treatment and exposure to film. The intensity of bands was quantified by FUJI FILM MultiGauge Software, and then normalized to the corresponding controls.

Levels of poly(GP) proteins in HEK293T cell lysates were measured using a previously described MSD-based sandwich immunoassay 43 . In brief, HEK293T cell lysates were diluted in TBS and an equal amount of protein for all samples was tested in duplicate wells. Serial dilutions of recombinant (GP) 8 peptide in TBS were used to prepare the standard curve. Response values corresponding to the intensity of emitted light on electrochemical stimulation of the assay plate using the MSD QUICKPLEX SQ120 were acquired. Responses were background-corrected using the average response from lysates obtained from non-transfected cells.

Levels of poly(GR) proteins in HEK293T cell lysates, as well as in mouse and human brain lysates, were similarly measured using a newly developed MSD-based sandwich immunoassay that utilizes affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies that detect poly(GR) as capture and detection antibodies. Lysates were diluted in TBS and added to wells (50 μl per well) at a final concentration of 65 μg per well. In addition, to confirm specificity of the assay for poly(GR), peptides representing each of the 5 dipeptide repeat proteins translated from C9orf72 repeat expansions ((GA) 8 , (GP) 8 , (GR) 8 , (PA) 8 and (PR) 8 ) were diluted in TBS and added to wells (50 μl per well) at final concentrations of 4, 20 and 100 ng per well. Response values corresponding to the intensity of emitted light on electrochemical stimulation of the assay plate using the MSD QUICKPLEX SQ120 were acquired and background-corrected using responses from lysates of respective controls.

RNA FISH was performed as previously described 44 with slight modifications. In brief, cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-PBS. Afterward, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/DEPC–PBS. Cells were then incubated with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 × saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC), 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0) for 30 min at 66 °C. In the meantime, LNA probes to detect sense G 4 C 2 repeats (/5TYE563/CCCCGGCCCCGGCCCC) were heated at 85°C for 75 s, and then diluted to 40 nM with hybridization buffer. After hybridization, cells were incubated with the diluted LNA probes at 66 °C for 24 h in a dark, humidified chamber. Cells were then washed once with 2 × SSC/0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min at room temperature, and twice with 0.2 × SSC for 10 min at 65 °C in the dark. The cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg ml –1 , Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the coverslips were mounted. Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope. To quantify foci-bearing cells, ~1,200–1,800 cells per coverslip and 3 coverslips per treatment were used for counting the number of foci-positive cells. These counts were used to determine the average percentage of foci-positive cells.

Data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (s.e.m.), and analyzed with two-tailed unpaired t-test, one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis (Prism statistical software). Statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data is described in RNA-Seq and Gene Ontology analysis above.
