# Title
Altered human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis

# Abstract
Oligodendrocyte (OL) pathology is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases as OLs both myelinate and provide metabolic support to axons. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) thus leads to neurodegeneration, but the severity of MS between patients is very variable. Disability does not correlate well with the extent of demyelination 1 , suggesting that other factors contribute to this variability. One such factor may be OL heterogeneity. Not all OLs are the same - mouse spinal cord OLs inherently produce longer myelin sheaths than cortical OLs 2 , and single cell analysis of mouse CNS identified further differences 3 , 4 . However, the extent of human OL heterogeneity and its possible contribution to MS pathology remains unknown. Here we performed single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) from white matter (WM) areas of post mortem human brain both in control (Ctr) and MS patients. We identified sub-clusters of oligodendroglia in Ctr human WM, some similar to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Strikingly, some sub-clusters were under-represented in MS tissue, while others were more prevalent. These differences in mature OL sub-clusters may indicate different functional states of OLs in MS lesions. Since this is similar in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), MS is a more diffuse disease than its focal demyelination suggests. Our findings of an altered oligodendroglial heterogeneity in MS may be important to understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches.

## Methods
Post-mortem unfixed frozen tissue and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue was obtained from the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank via a UK prospective donor scheme with full premortem consent and with full ethical approval by MREC/02/2/39 (UK Ethics Committee) and 2016/589-31 (Regionala Etiskprövningsnämnden, Stockholm, Sweden). For the snRNA-seq, we used white matter regions from fresh-frozen tissue sections for both controls (4 males and 1 female), NAWM and MS lesions (3 males and 1 female). Controls ( Supplementary Table1 ): 5 samples from 5 different donors, NAWM: 3 samples from 3 patients, Chronic Active: 4 samples from 4 patients, Active: 3 samples from 2 patients, Chronic inactive: 3 samples from 3 patients, Remyelinated: 2 samples from 2 patients. For the in-situ validation on FFPE tissue sections we used a total of 11 Ctr (5 males and 6 females) and 15 MS (7 males and 8 females) tissue samples from different donors. The Ctr and MS donors did not have a significantly different age difference (Ctr frozen: 58.0±17.5 yrs, MS frozen: 46.8±8.4 yrs, Ctr FFPE: 57.7±12.3 yrs, MS FFPE: 53.5±9.1 yrs, One-way ANOVA (p=0.3724), F(3, 31)=1.079, Tukey’s multiple comparison test: Ctr frozen vs. MS frozen: p=0.4769, Ctr frozen vs. Ctr FFPE: p>0.9999, Ctr frozen vs. MS FFPE: p=0.8713, MS frozen vs. Ctr FFPE: p=0.3775, MS frozen vs. MS FFPE: p=0.7307, Ctr FFPE vs. MS FFPE: p=0.7889, data displayed as mean ± SD).

Nuclei were isolated from fresh-frozen 10μm sections as previously described 24 with modifications. The regions of interest were macro-dissected with a scalpel blade, lysed in Nuclei Isolation Buffer (NEB, 10mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 0.25M Sucrose, 5mM MgCl2, 25mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X) with 0.1mM DTT and 0.4U/ul RNAse Inhibitors freshly added before use and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was filtered through a 30μm strainer and centrifuged for 10min at 1,000g. The pellet was re-suspended in 400μl cold PBS with 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors and 310μl of solution mixed with 90μl of debris removal solution (Miltenyi Biotech), overlaid with 400μl of cold PBS with 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors and centrifuged for 10min at 3,000g. The supernatant was removed, the pellet washed with cold PBS with 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors and re-suspended in PBS 0.5% BSA with 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors. The remaining 90μl were diluted with 180μl of cold PBS 0.75% BSA 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors, filtered through a decreasing cell strainer size (30-10µm) and centrifuged for 5min at 1,000g. The pellet was re-suspended in 25μl PBS 0.5% BSA with 0.4U/μl RNAse inhibitors. The 2 pellets were combined 1:4 (filtered : debris removed, respectively) for further 10x loading.

25μl of wash buffer (10mM TrisHCl, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl 2 , 0.005% NP40) with 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitors was added to each nuclei suspension, gently mixed and incubated for 5min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged for 5min at 1,000g and the pellet gently re-suspended in PBS 2% BSA 0.2U/μl RNAse Inhibitors. For quantification, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst (5μg/ml) and counted in a hemocytometer. A total of 8,000 estimated nuclei for each sample was loaded on the 10x MicroChip, although a much lower number of nuclei was recovered after sequencing ( Supplementary Table 2 ).

cDNA libraries have been prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead kit v2 (120267) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The 20 samples were aligned with Cellranger -version (2.1.1) with reference genome GRCh38-1.2.0. Then, each of the output filtered UMI count matrixes was used as input for Velocyto 25 with the parameters, velocyto run10x -m repeatMasker_filtered_UMI_count_matrixes GRCh38-1.2.0_genes.gtf. The repeatmasker track was download from UCSC tables. Velocyto only considers uniquely mapped reads from cellranger output UMI matrixes and reads that align to both exonic regions and intronic regions. The new UMI count matrices were exported from loom file format to R object format with Velocyto 25 R package. For each of the samples, we combined the spliced and unspliced count matrices to get a matrix of 33692 genes across 35753 cells. This final aggregate UMI matrices were used for all the downstream analyses. We checked quality metrics and removed cells with less than 200 genes and a total count below 500 and genes with a count above 1 in at least 3 cells.

The following data processing was carried out with Seurat 7 (version 2.1). For each of the 20 samples, first we set up a first filter of min.cells = 3 and min.genes = 200 per sample, filtered by number of UMI (>6000), genes (<200) and mitochondrial percentage (>0.20). The distribution for gene, UMI and reads mapped to mitochondrial genome were visually inspected and used for quality assurance. Post-processed matrices were then log-normalized individually with a scale of factor of 10,000, followed by regressing inter-cellular variation in gene expression by UMI counts and batch number, and scaling of the gene expression. Highly variable genes (HVG) were set up as the union from the top 1000 HVG from each sample, resulting in 4361 genes.

After quality filtering, 17799 nuclei and 21581 genes remained. Shared-nearest neighbor (SNN) graph was constructed on cell-to-cell distance matrix from top 15 aligned canonical correlation vectors. The SNN graph with different resolution was used as an input for smart local moving (SLM) algorithm to obtain cell clusters, and visualized with t-Distributed Stochastic neighbor Embedding (tSNE). We performed the analysis in three different resolutions 0.8, 2 and 4. Based on differential expressed genes, identified by Wilcoxon rank sum test, with parameters min.pct = 0.25, thresh.use = 0.25, test.use = "wilcox” 7 ., we manually assigned and verified the consistency of the three different resolutions ( Extended data Figure 2 ). Based on prior knowledge and consistency within different resolutions we selected the final number of cluster between the resolutions 2 and 4, which included all the major cell types in the brain a novel cell types 26 , resulting in 23 different clusters.

The CC alignment applied for the Control and MS combined analysis minimized inter-sample variability to reduce possible batch effects, due to the individual variability or technical performance leading to intermingled comparable clusters that contained MS and Control nuclei. First, oligodendrocyte lineage cell types were identified based on canonical and novel markers 3 from differential expression analysis. In order to verify cell identity, the expression patterns distributions were used in the different Oligo subclusters, and then verified in as separate based on the markers. In addition, evidence from mouse single cell data 26 has shown OLs with an immunological phenotype in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The combination of different resolutions allowed us to identify OLs expressing immune genes in the human dataset (ImOLG).

In order to verify the subcluster identity and possible over or under clustering, a classification hierarchy was built. This approach places transcriptionally similar clusters close to each other on a tree allowing us to finally define the 6 Oligo clusters, the OPCs, the COPs and the ImOlGs as different separate clusters that were later validated with specific markers.

Dimensional reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), followed by regressing out each of the sample variables, showed segregation of clusters based on patient identity ( Extended Fig.7 ), suggestive of batch effects and individual variability. Thus, we performed CCA, considering all the individual samples as a variable and using the union of the top variable genes from each of the samples, in order to get common but also specific variable genes from all samples and discarding cells with higher than 0.5 PCA/CCA variance. CCA allows the alignment of all samples to a common low dimensional subspace followed by clustering 7 , showing that nuclei cluster more according to cell type rather than sample identity ( Fig.1a and Extended Fig.3 ).

The normalized expression matrix from Falcao et al. 26 was retrieved and mouse mm10 Genesymbol IDs were extracted and combined with GRCh38 ENSEMBL geneIDs from Biomart 27 . We recovered a final matrix with unique GRCh38 gene symbols renamed from mm10. For the comparison analysis we combined in a single matrix the 6 Oligo clusters, OPCs, COPs and ImOlGs from human with the EAE mouse renamed matrix cells. Both datasets included only oligodendrocyte lineage cell clusters that combined MS, or EAE in mouse, and controls. The combined 900 most variable genes as described in 28 from all the mouse and human OLs were used to classify the celltypes. The datasets similarity analysis was performed with an unsupervised classifying approach to find the most similar cell types, using as a training and testing both datasets and with a top hits threshold of >= 0.7 mean area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 28 score.

UMI count matrices from human cerebellar hemisphere (CH) (24580 genes, 5204 cells), frontal cortex (FC) (24654 genes, 10319 cells) and visual cortex (VC) (32693 genes,1386 cells) were retrieved from GEO (GSE97930), and pre-processed independently. First, cells that had no annotation were discarded (1 cell from frontal cortex UMI count matrix). We performed a quality control procedure as described above. Cells with a number of genes > 3100 (CH, FC and VC) and <350 (FC and VC) and number of UMI >5600 (CH, FC and VC) were considered as low quality or outliers, and were thereafter removed from downstream analysis. After quality controls, 5199, 9557 and 18645 cells remained (CH, FC and VC). Post-processed matrices were then log-normalized individually with a scale of factor of 10,000, followed by regressing inter-cellular variation in gene expression by UMI counts and batch number, and scaling of the gene expression. Canonical correlation analysis 7 each region. The first 17 canonical correlation components (CCs) were chosen. There were 465 cells in the 17 CCs with PCA/CCA variance more than 0.5, and thus were considered regional/batch specific and removed for following dataset alignment. After aligning regional expression in the first 17 CCs, clustering, visualization and OLs sub-setting were performed.

UMI count matrices of human archived brain samples were retrieved from https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/dronc-seq-single-nucleus-rna-seq-on-human-archived-brain#study-summary . Hippocampus (HIP) (10326 genes, 5433 cells) and Prefrontal cortex (PFC) (10326 genes, 9530 cells) expression matrices were separated and underwent quality control. Cells with a number of genes > 4000 and < 400 (PFC) and <350 (HIP), number of UMI >7500 (PFC and HIP), and mitochondrial percentage < 0.05 (PFC) and > 0.15 (HIP) were considered as low quality or outliers and were thereafter removed from downstream analysis. 6062 PFC cells and 4765 HIP cells remained. Each regional dataset was then log-normalized with a scale of factor of 10,000, followed by regressing inter-cellular variation in gene expression by UMI counts and mitochondrial percentage, and scaling of the gene expression. Highly variable genes were identified as with the Lake dataset, but with the high end cut off of 4 for average expression, and a union of 1521 variable genes was used for canonical correlation analysis. CCA/PCA variance, dataset low dimensional subspace alignments, followed by clustering and OLs linkage sub-setting were performed as above with the first 11 CCs with 9702 cells in total after discarding cells with higher than 0.5 PCA/CCA variance.

Oligodendroglial subsets from our Controls, Lake et al. and Habib et al. datasets 29 , 30 . were combined by performing a canonical component analysis with the union of top 1000 highly variable genes from each dataset, and then 11 CCs were aligned after discarding data specific cells. Differentially expressed genes that were conserved among the datasets were identified by first performing individual within-dataset Wilcoxon rank sum tests, followed by ranking genes according to a unified combined Fisher’s p-values. The resulting clusters were found under resolution 1.0.

Seurat2.1 was also used for PCA of the 20 MS and Control samples. The filtered expression matrix, as described before, was log-normalized with a scale factor of 10000, scaled and regressed on number of UMI and sample ID. PCA was run on highly variable genes, which was identified as previously described. 15 PCs were used and the HNN graph was constructed based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space, where the clusters were then identified using Louvain algorithm. The clusters were visualized using t-SNE. Clustering was run in three different resolutions, 0.8, 2 and 4, in order to be comparable with the clusters obtained with the CCA.

Cells were ordered, and lineages were approximated using a previously published pipeline 31 . In short, single nuclei were filtered so that each nucleus contained at least 500 UMI counts, and at least 400 genes. We then used spatially correlating gene selection on the diffusion mapping 32 obtained transition matrix. Subsequently, we reduced the high-dimensional space using non-negative matrix factorization 33 , of which the ideal ranks are estimated using a measure of mutual information across the obtained components. The selected rank was obtained by selecting the rank number for which the calculated joined mutual information no longer highly decreases upon increasing rank. The non-negative matrix is then transformed in a transition space using diffusion mapping for which then lineages are calculated. Please see our github page Castelo-Branco-lab/GeneFocus for recent code.

For differential expression analysis MAST was used 34 . All oligodendrocyte lineage cells were included in the analysis. An FDR of 0.05 was taken, and genes were selected with a log fold change of at least 5 to be included in the plot in Fig 4a . Proportional expression was calculated by taking the mean expression value of the cells, leading to a heavily 0 biased threshold. Cells expressing higher than this threshold are considered to be expressing cells, the proportion of expressing cells was then calculated on a per gene basis.

For the GO analyses, the most significantly differentially expressed genes from the snRNA-seq experiment of each OL subcluster were selected (adjusted p-val ≤0.05, log fold change ≥0.5). GO and pathway analysis was performed with the ClueGO (version 2.5.2) plug-in Cytoscape (version 3.7.0) 35 with settings, GO Biological process (04.09.2018) and REACTOME pathways (04.09.2018), showing only pathways with p-val <= 0.05. Default settings and GO fusion were used, for subclusters with more than 200 significantly regulated genes (OPCs and COPs) a minimum of 7 genes per cluster were used, for sublusters less than 50 significantly regulated genes (Oligo4 and Oligo2) a minimum of 2 genes per cluster, for all other subclusters, a minimum of 5 genes per cluster were used.

4μm FFPE sections were deparaffinized in decreasing EtOH concentrations and antigen retrieval was performed in antigen unmasking solution (Vector laboratories, H-3300) for 10min. For colorimetric labelling, sections were washed in PBS, blocked for 30min at RT with PBS 0.5% Triton (PBS-T) 10% heat inactivated horse serum (HIHS, blocking buffer). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight a 4°C in blocking buffer. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- or alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labelled secondary antibody according to the respective species for 2hrs at RT. Color reaction was performed using DAB or VectorBlue reaction kits (Vector laboratories, SK-4100 and SK-5300 respectively). Sections were washed and mounted. For fluorescent labelling, deparaffinized sections were incubated with autofluorescence eliminator reagent (Millipore, 2160) for 1min and washed with TBS 0.001% TritonX (wash buffer). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% H 2 O 2 for 15min at RT, washed and blocked for 30min at RT with TBS 0.5% Triton (TBS-T) 10% HIHS (blocking buffer 2). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight a 4°C in blocking buffer 2. Fluorophore reaction was performed using thyramide reaction kits for fluorescein, Cyanine 3 and Cyanine 5 (Perkin Elmer, NEL741B001KT, NEL744B001KT, NEL745B001KT respectively). Sections were counterstained using Hoechst (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, 62249), washed and mounted. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit (rb)-Olig2 (Atlas, HPA003254, 1:100), goat (gt)-Olig2 (R&D Systems, AF2418, 1:100), rb-Olig1 (Abcam, ab68105, 1:100), rb-Mrf (Millipore, ABN45, 1:100), rb-Opalin (Abcam, ab121425, 1:100), rb-Sox6(Millipore, AB5805, 1:100) and gt-KLK6 (Life Technologies, PA547239, 1:100). The specificity of our MRF antibody was validated by Western Blot as well as a combination of mRNA and protein-labelling in our tissue ( Extended Fig. 7 ). The following secondary antibodies were used: Vector laboratories, rb-HRP IgG (MP-7401), rb-AP IgG (MP-5401), gt-HRP (MP-7405), ms-HRP IgG (MP-7402), ms-AP IgG (MP-5402).

BaseScope mRNA detection was performed according to the manual using the RNAScope pretreatment and wash buffer reagents (ACD, 322380 and 310091 respectively) and BaseScope Red and BaseScope duplex detection kits (ACD, 322910 and 3223810, respectively). 4μm FFPE sections were deparaffinized 2x 5min in Xylene and 2x 2min in EtOH. Sections were dried and incubated with H 2 O 2 for 10min. Pretreatment was performed for 45min with pretreatment buffer, incubated for 3min in EtOH and dried overnight. Protease treatment was performed using proteaseIV for 1hr at 40°C, the protease was refreshed after 15min. Sections were washed in deionized water and probes were incubated for 2hrs at 40°C. Sections were washed in wash buffer and color reaction was performed according to the user manual with the following adjustments: for the single BaseScope detection, the AMP5 step was increased to 45min. For the duplex assay the steps Amp7 and Amp11 were increased to 1hr. All the probes have been designed and produced by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Probes against the following human genes were used: Channel 1 probes: BREVICAN , CDH20 , WWOX , KLK6 , CLDND1 , OPALIN . Channel2 probes: LURAPL1.AS1 and CDH20 . For the single assay, subsequent IHC was performed as described above. For the duplex assay, sections were counterstained for 1min with Hematoxilin (Scientific Laboratories, GHS132-1L) and blue reaction was performed using 0.02% ammonia water. Sections were dried at 60°C and mounted.

Brightfield images have been acquired using a Widefield observer (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer) slide scanner. Fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji 36 and QuPath 37 imaging software. For cell quantification of fluorescent images and brightfield images where no automated quantification was possible, a minimum of 8 randomly chosen regions of equal dimensions per patient and region have been acquired. Total cell numbers/mm 2 have been calculated based on the picture dimensions. For fluorescent images, z-stacks have been collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells has been quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. For quantification of the single channel brightfield images and the BaseScope IHC double positive images, the number of cells also have been quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. The average of these different regions has been taken and is considered as n=1. Where possible, brightfield images have been quantified automated. Therefore, whole slides have been scanned using a slide scanner. Using QuPath, a minimum of 4 random regions per sample and condition have been annotated and cells within these regions have been quantified using the automated ‘positive cell detection’ plugin.

For the quantification of the duplex BaseScope, random brightfield images have been acquired in the WM of Ctr donors. All cells having any positive BaseScope signal have been quantified and represent 100% of labelled cells, the % of single- or double positive cells have been determined.

For the quantification of the mRNA-expression differences between MS lesions, whole sections were scanned with a slide scanner. Lesioned regions were highlighted by the absence of CNP IHC. Within these regions, between 4 and 11 random regions of equal size have been annotated using QuPath and the number of BaseScope-positive dots have been quantified. The average of the random regions within 1 lesioned area were considered as n=1.

Fresh frozen human brain sections (10µm) were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific 89900), sonicated, centrifuged for 10min at 13,000g and the supernatant collected. 10µl of supernatant per lane was diluted in RIPA and Laemmli-buffer and incubated for 5min at 96°C. Proteins were separated on an SDS-gel (Bio-Rad #161-1176) together with a protein ladder (Bio-Rad kaleidoscope standard #161-0375). Proteins were blotted on a PVDF membrane in a wet blotting chamber with transfer buffer (1xTris-Glycine buffer, 20% MeOH) (2hrs @400mA). Membrane was washed with 1x TBS 0.01% Tween (TBS-T) and blocked for 1hr with TBS-T, 5% milk. The primary antibody (rb-MRF, Millipore, ABN45, 1:500) was incubated in blocking buffer over night at 4°C. The membrane was washed and secondary antibody (anti-rb HRP, Vector laboratories MP-7401,1:10,000) was incubated for 1hr at RT in blocking buffer. The membrane was washed and incubated for 5min with ECL solution (Thermo Scientific 1863031). Proteins were visualized using x-ray film.
