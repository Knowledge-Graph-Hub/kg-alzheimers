Opposite microglial activation stages upon loss ofPGRNorTREM2 result in reduced cerebral glucose metabolism

# Abstract
Microglia adopt numerous fates with homeostatic microglia ( HM ) and a microglial neurodegenerative phenotype ( MG nD) representing two opposite ends. A number of variants in genes selectively expressed in microglia are associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ). Among these genes are progranulin ( GRN ) and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM 2 ). Both cause neurodegeneration by mechanisms involving loss of function. We have now isolated microglia from Grn −/− mice and compared their transcriptomes to those of Trem2 −/− mice . Surprisingly, while loss of Trem2 enhances the expression of genes associated with a homeostatic state, microglia derived from Grn −/− mice showed a reciprocal activation of the MG nD molecular signature and suppression of gene characteristic for HM . The opposite mRNA expression profiles are associated with divergent functional phenotypes. Although loss of TREM 2 and progranulin resulted in opposite activation states and functional phenotypes of microglia, FDG (fluoro‐2‐deoxy‐ d ‐glucose)‐μ PET of brain revealed reduced glucose metabolism in both conditions, suggesting that opposite microglial phenotypes result in similar wide spread brain dysfunction.

## Introduction
While for a long time researchers distinguished only two distinct stages of microglia, the M1 and the M2 phenotype, recent evidence strongly indicates that a multitude of functionally diverse microglial populations exists in a dynamic equilibrium (Ransohoff, 2016 ; Keren‐Shaul et al , 2017 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ). This becomes very apparent when one compares mRNA signatures of microglia isolated from various mouse models for neurodegeneration and compares them to controls (Abduljaleel et al , 2014 ; Butovsky et al , 2015 ; Holtman et al , 2015 ; Keren‐Shaul et al , 2017 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ). In mouse models for neurodegenerative diseases, mRNA signatures were identified which are characteristic for a disease‐associated microglia (DAM)/a microglial neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD) whereas in controls a homeostatic microglial (HM) signature was observed (Butovsky et al , 2014 , 2015 ; Holtman et al , 2015 ; Keren‐Shaul et al , 2017 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ). MGnD upregulates a characteristic set of genes, which may initially allow microglia to respond to neuronal injury in a defensive manner. This includes the induction of pathways triggering phagocytosis, chemotaxis/migration, and cytokine release. The upregulation of genes involved in those pathways goes along with a suppression of homeostatic genes (Butovsky et al , 2015 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ). Key genes involved in the switch of HM to MGnD are regulated by the TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) ApoE (apolipoprotein E) pathway (Krasemann et al , 2017 ).

A pivotal role of microglia in neurodegeneration is strongly supported by the identification of sequence variants found in a number of genes robustly or even selectively expressed within microglia in the brain, among them GRN (encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein; Baker et al , 2006 ; Cruts & Van Broeckhoven, 2008 ; Zhang et al , 2014 ; Gotzl et al , 2016 ; Lui et al , 2016 ) and TREM2 (Guerreiro et al , 2013 ; Jonsson & Stefansson, 2013 ; Jonsson et al , 2013 ; Rayaprolu et al , 2013 ; Borroni et al , 2014 ; Cuyvers et al , 2014 ; Ulrich et al , 2017 ). Mutations in the GRN gene (Baker et al , 2006 ; Cruts et al , 2006 ) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (TAR‐DNA binding protein 43)‐positive inclusions due to haploinsufficiency. PGRN is a growth factor‐like protein with neurotrophic properties in the brain (Van Damme et al , 2008 ). PGRN is also transported to lysosomes (Hu et al , 2010 ; Zhou et al , 2015 ) where it appears to regulate expression and activity of lysosomal proteins (Ahmed et al , 2010 ; Hu et al , 2010 ; Wils et al , 2012 ; Tanaka et al , 2013a , b ; Gotzl et al , 2014 , 2016 , 2018 ; Beel et al , 2017 ; Chang et al , 2017 ; Ward et al , 2017 ; Zhou et al , 2017 ). PGRN is proteolytically processed into granulin peptides, which can be found in biological fluids (Bateman et al , 1990 ; Shoyab et al , 1990 ; Belcourt et al , 1993 ; Cenik et al , 2012 ). TREM2 is produced as a membrane‐bound type‐1 protein (Kleinberger et al , 2014 ), which traffics to the cell surface where it mediates signaling via binding to its co‐receptor, the DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12; Ulrich & Holtzman, 2016 ; Yeh et al , 2017 ). Signaling is terminated by proteolytic shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain (Kleinberger et al , 2014 ; Schlepckow et al , 2017 ). Several sequence variants associated with TREM2 cause neurodegeneration via a loss of function (Kleinberger et al , 2014 , 2017 ; Schlepckow et al , 2017 ; Ulland et al , 2017 ; Song et al , 2018 ). Sequence variants of TREM2 affect a multitude of functions including chemotaxis, migration, survival, binding of phospholipids and ApoE, proliferation, survival, and others (Kleinberger et al , 2014 , 2017 ; Atagi et al , 2015 ; Bailey et al , 2015 ; Wang et al , 2015 ; Yeh et al , 2016 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ; Ulland et al , 2017 ). Strikingly, a loss of TREM2 function locks microglia in a homeostatic state (Krasemann et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Instead of suppressing their homeostatic mRNA signature like mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders, in the absence of TREM2 microglia even enhance expression of homeostatic genes and fail to express the disease‐associated signature (Krasemann et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). As a result, TREM2 deficiency decreases chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and barrier function (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ; Ulland et al , 2017 ). TREM2 therefore appears to play a key role as a central hub gene in the regulation of microglial homeostasis. We now investigated microglial gene expression and function in the absence of PGRN and made the surprising observation that loss of TREM2 or PGRN leads to opposite microglial activity phenotypes, which, however, both cause wide spread brain dysfunction.

## Results
Loss‐of‐function mutations in TREM2 are associated with various types of neurodegeneration, including a FTLD‐like syndrome (Ulrich & Holtzman, 2016 ). Similarly, haploinsufficiency of GRN is associated with TDP‐43‐positive FTLD (Baker et al , 2006 ; Cruts et al , 2006 ; Cruts & Van Broeckhoven, 2008 ). At least some of the GRN ‐dependent FTLD‐associated phenotypes can be mimicked in a mouse model entirely lacking PGRN (Ahmed et al , 2010 ; Yin et al , 2010 ; Wils et al , 2012 ; Gotzl et al , 2014 ). Furthermore, both, a Trem2 knockout and the knockin of the p.T66M mutation, mimic features of a FTD‐like syndrome (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Since both proteins are preferentially expressed in microglia, we compared loss‐of‐PGRN‐associated microglial phenotypes with those known for TREM2 deficiency (Krasemann et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). To do so, we first purified microglia from brains of adult Grn −/− mice by fluorescence‐associated cell sorting (FACS) using microglia‐specific anti‐FCRLS and anti‐CD11b antibodies. We then investigated the expression pattern of gene characteristic for MGnD and HM using NanoString gene expression profiling (MG534; Butovsky et al , 2014 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ; Dataset EV1). Gene expression levels in each sample were normalized against the geometric mean of five housekeeping genes including Cltc , Gapdh , Gusb , Hprt1 , and Tubb5 . Out of 529 genes analyzed, 58 genes were significantly upregulated and 58 genes were downregulated. Strikingly, genes most strongly upregulated in Grn −/− microglia are those previously described for MGnD (Fig 1 A; Butovsky et al , 2015 ; Holtman et al , 2015 ; Keren‐Shaul et al , 2017 ; Krasemann et al , 2017 ). These include ApoE , as the most upregulated gene, Ly9 , Clec7a , Dnajb4 , Cccl4, and many others suggesting that PGRN‐deficient microglia adopt the MGnD state. We then compared the Grn −/− microglial signature to the previously analyzed molecular signature of Trem2 −/− microglia (Fig 1 B and C; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Both NanoString gene expression panels overlapped in 418 genes. Out these, 359 mRNAs could be detected in both screens (Dataset EV1). In the Grn −/− microglia, 40 mRNAs were upregulated and 55 mRNAs were downregulated, whereas in the Trem2 −/− microglia, 87 mRNAs were increased and 27 mRNAs were decreased (Fig 1 C; left two panels). Interestingly, while only six mRNAs were equally up/downregulated in both phenotypes, 32 mRNAs showed an opposite regulation (Fig 1 C; right panel). Strikingly, while in Grn −/− mice the neurodegenerative disease‐associated signature is massively upregulated, this set of genes is suppressed in the Trem2 −/− microglia (Fig 1 B and D; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Similarly, the homeostatic mRNA signature is slightly but significantly upregulated in Trem2 −/− microglia (Mazaheri et al , 2017 ) but severely suppressed in Grn −/− microglia (Fig 1 B and D).

Expression of proteins associated with MGnDs such as ApoE, CLEC7A, TREM2, and CD68 was also increased in acutely isolated microglia (Fig 2 A and B). sTREM2 was also found to be increased in brains and serum of Grn −/− mice (Fig 2 C and D), although no increase in Trem2 mRNA levels was observed in the NanoString analysis (Fig 1 B), suggesting posttranscriptional regulation. Furthermore, protein expression of the homeostatic P2ry12 gene is downregulated in cortical Grn −/− microglia (Fig 2 E and F), while cortical microglia from Trem2 −/− mice show strongly elevated P2RY12 levels (Fig 2 E and F), consistent with the finding that microglia from both mouse models are in opposite activation states. These findings were further confirmed in genetically modified BV2 microglia‐like cells lacking PGRN expression, where ApoE, CLEC7A, and TREM2 were upregulated, whereas P2RY12 was downregulated (Fig 2 G–I). In line with the protein expression, in PGRN‐deficient BV2 cells, transcripts encoding Apoe , Clec7a , and Trem2 were also significantly upregulated, whereas P2ry12 was downregulated (Fig 2 J) further confirming that loss of PGRN results in a microglial hyperactivation.

Next, we investigated a series of functional phenotypes in Grn loss‐of‐function mutants, which may be differentially affected by dysregulated Trem2 or Grn gene expression. First, we investigated the phagocytic capacity of PGRN‐deficient BV2 cells, which recapitulate expression profile changes found in isolated Grn −/− microglia such as enhanced expression of ApoE, CLEC7A, and TREM2 (Fig 2 ). We observed a significantly increased uptake of pHrodo‐labeled Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) in PGRN‐deficient BV2 cells compared to wt (Fig 3 A). Enhanced uptake of pHrodo‐labeled bacteria is in strong contrast to the reduced uptake detected in Trem2 loss‐of‐function mutations (Fig EV1 A; Kleinberger et al , 2014 , 2017 ; Schlepckow et al , 2017 ), thus demonstrating that differentially regulated mRNA signatures translate into opposite phagocytic phenotypes. In acutely isolated microglia, uptake of bacteria was also reduced upon loss of TREM2 (Fig EV1 B). Grn −/− microglia displayed only a slight but significant increase in phagocytosis (Fig EV1 B). The rather minor effect of the Grn knockout on increased microglial phagocytosis is most likely due to isolation‐induced activation of microglia (Gosselin et al , 2017 ), which as a consequence already show a rather high uptake capacity.

Previously, we demonstrated that microglia of Trem2 −/− mice are locked in a homeostatic state and fail to migrate (Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Since microglia of Grn −/− mice express a RNA profile typical for MGnD, we investigated if that results in increased migration. To assess migration ex vivo , we cultured organotypic brain slices from young (P6‐7) mice as recently described (Daria et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). In line with our previous findings, we found only baseline migration of wt microglia reflected by few migrating CD68‐positive cells detected mainly in the vicinity of the brain tissue (Fig 3 B–D). On the contrary, the number of migrating CD68‐positive cells and their distance migrated were both significantly increased in brain slices derived from the Grn −/− mice (Fig 3 B–D). Again, this finding is in clear contrast to our previous observation in cultured organotypic brain slices derived from Trem2 −/− mice, where we found a severe inhibition of migration as compared to wt (Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). The increased migratory potential is in line with enhanced clustering of IBA1‐positive microglia that we detected around amyloid plaques in APPPS1/ Grn −/− versus APPPS1/ Grn +/+ mice (Figs 3 E and F, and EV1 C). Again, this finding is opposite to what was found in the absence of functional TREM2, namely impaired clustering of microglia around amyloid plaques (Wang et al , 2016 ; Parhizkar et al , 2019 ) and a general reduction of chemotaxis (Mazaheri et al , 2017 ).

To confirm that our findings have relevance in vivo , we searched for differences in microglial activity between Trem2 −/− and Grn −/− mice by previously established in vivo TSPO‐μPET imaging (Liu et al , 2015 ; Kleinberger et al , 2017 ). In line with the hypothesis gained from in vitro experiments, we observed a striking upregulation of microglial activity throughout the cerebrum of Grn −/− mice when compared to wt (Fig 4 A). Differences were pronounced in the neocortex but also present in subcortical areas. On the contrary, a reduced microglial activity was apparent in the entire cerebrum of Trem2 −/− mice, fitting to our recent findings in a TREM2 loss‐of‐function model (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ; Fig 4 A).

A TSPO‐μPET in rodents: Axial slices (A1, A2, A3) of averaged %‐TSPO‐PET differences between Grn −/− or Trem2 −/− mice and wt indicate increased microglial activity in the cerebrum of Grn −/− mice (hot color scale) and decreased microglial activity in the cerebrum of Trem2 −/− mice (cold color scale). Scatter plot depicts single TSPO‐μPET values deriving from a neocortical volume of interest. Data represent the mean +/− SD. μPET results are illustrated upon an MRI template; 6–10 female mice per group ( Grn −/− n = 6 at 8 months, Trem2 −/− n = 8 at 11 months; wt n = 10 at 8–11 months).

Furthermore, we translationally investigated a FTLD patient with a genetically confirmed GRN (NM_002087.2) loss‐of‐function mutation (c.328C>T, p.(Arg110*)). Haploinsufficiency of PGRN was proven by ELISA‐mediated quantitative analysis of the patient's serum (Fig 4 B). TSPO‐PET imaging revealed elevated cortical microglial activity in comparison with a FTLD patient screened negative for variants in the GRN, MAPT, C9orf72, or the TREM2 gene (Fig 4 C).

Next, we investigated whether alterations of microglial activity have an impact on synaptic brain function as assessed by in vivo FDG‐μPET. We observed a cerebral hypometabolism not only in Trem2 −/− mice, which had been anticipated from our previous study (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ), but even more severe in Grn −/− mice (Fig 5 ). As activated microglia itself could lead to increased energy consumption, the results in Grn −/− mice appear even more striking. Thus, a failure of brain function was confirmed as a consequence of both, arresting microglia in a homeostatic and a disease‐associated stage.

Scatter plot depicts single FDG‐PET values deriving from a neocortical volume of interest. Data represent the mean +/− SD. μPET results are illustrated upon an MRI template; 6–10 female mice per group ( Grn −/− n = 6 at 8 months, Trem2 −/− n = 6 at 11 months; wt n = 10 at 8–11 months). Statistics were derived from one‐way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test.

## Discussion
Taken together, our findings demonstrate that microglia lacking functional TREM2 or PGRN exhibit opposite mRNA profiles. This is consistent with the differential TSPO‐PET signal observed in both animal models. While Grn −/− mice exhibit a hyperactivated phenotype, which is consistent with the observation that Grn −/− mice exhibit an exaggerated inflammation (Yin et al , 2010 ; Martens et al , 2012 ; Tanaka et al , 2013a ; Lui et al , 2016 ) as well as induced expression of TYROBP network genes including Trem2 (Takahashi et al , 2017 ), TREM2 loss of function results in reduced microglial activity. As a consequence, several functional assays including phagocytic capacity, migration, and chemotactic clustering around amyloid plaques revealed opposite phenotypes. Thus, loss of PGRN or TREM2 arrests microglia at the two extreme ends of a potential gradient of dynamic microglial populations (Fig 6 ; upper panel). Nevertheless, in both animal models we observed a dramatic reduction of glucose metabolism throughout the brain and loss of either protein causes severe neurodegeneration in humans. Reduced energy metabolism in Trem2 −/− mice is in line with previous observations (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ; Ulland et al , 2017 ). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that microglia on the opposite ends of a large spectrum of functionally divergent microglial populations cause neurological dysfunctions that ultimately may result in neurodegeneration. In fact, disease‐associated variants of TREM2 are associated with a loss of a protective function of TREM2 (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ; Song et al , 2018 ) and some mutations appear to lock microglia in a homeostatic stage (Krasemann et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). On the other hand, during aging wild‐type microglia in an AD mouse model lose their motility and phagocytic activity (Krabbe et al , 2013 ) although they express a neurodegenerative disease‐associated mRNA profile (Krasemann et al , 2017 ). This may indicate that “over‐activation” for a prolonged period of time may be detrimental for microglia and drive them into a loss‐of‐function phenotype. Our findings also indicate that arresting microglia in either a homeostatic state or a disease‐associated state would be equally detrimental. This has important consequences for therapeutic strategies aiming to modulate microglial activity. Clearly, locking microglia in any of the two extreme states is detrimental (Fig 6 , upper panel). Rather, microglia locked in a homeostatic state should be activated whereas microglia arrested in a disease‐associated state may be silenced (Fig 6 , lower panel). Nevertheless, during long‐term treatment “over‐activation” and “over‐silencing” of microglia may both be equally detrimental, since that may drive microglia to the opposite ends of the gradient. As a consequence, the therapeutic window for microglial modulation may be rather limited (Fig 6 , lower panel) and care must be taken to balance microglial activity.

## Materials and Methods
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with local animal‐handling laws. Housing conditions included standard pellet food and water provided ad libitum , 12‐h light–dark cycle at temperature of 22°C with maximal 5 mice per cage and cage replacement once per week, and regular health monitoring. Mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation. Brain tissue, microglia, and serum were obtained from the Grn −/− mouse strain (Kayasuga et al , 2007 ), brain tissue and microglia were obtained from the Trem2 −/− mouse strain (Turnbull et al , 2006 ), and brain tissue was obtained from a mouse model for amyloid pathology (APPPS1; Radde et al , 2006 ) crossed with the Grn −/− mouse strain (APPPS1/ Grn − / − ). Experiments were performed with mice of both genders at 2–18 months of age. Organotypic brain slices were taken from postnatal days 6–7 of Grn −/− and wt mice.

FCRLS (Butovsky et al , 2014 )‐ and CD11b (BD biosciences; Clone M1/70)‐positive primary microglia were isolated from mouse brains of 5.5 months of Grn −/− and wt mice ( n = 5 per genotype, male) as described (Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Total RNA was isolated using mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng RNA per sample was used for gene expressing profiling using nCounter Analysis, NanoString technology as described (Butovsky et al , 2014 , 2015 ). In brief, the MG534 NanoString chip was designed using the quantitative NanoString nCounter platform. Selection of genes is based on analyses that identified genes and proteins, which are specifically or highly expressed in adult mouse microglia (Butovsky et al , 2014 ) and encompasses 400 homeostatic unique and enriched microglial genes (Butovsky et al , 2014 ), 129 disease‐associated genes, and 5 housekeeping genes (Krasemann et al , 2017 ).

NanoString data were normalized and analyzed using nSolver™ software. RNA ncounts were normalized using the geometric mean of five housekeeping genes including Cltc , Gapdh , Gusb , Hprt1, and Tubb5 using nSolver™ Analysis Software, version 3.0 (NanoString Technologies, Inc.). A cutoff was introduced at the value two‐fold of the highest negative control present on the chip. Fold changes were calculated using the average of each group. For each experiment, the fold changes were calculated comparing the experimental group to their appropriate controls. To compare the normalized gene expression levels in Grn −/− and wt mice, unpaired two‐tailed Student's t ‐test was performed (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001). The volcano blot was generated employing GraphPad Prism 7 software. The heatmap was generated employing Multi Experiment Viewer v 4.9. The expression value for each gene was normalized to the mean value of wt mice followed by a log2 transformation.

Blood collected from Grn −/− and wt mice (3, 6, 13, 16–18 months of age, female and male mice as indicated in the source data file to Fig 2) was left at room temperature (RT) to allow the blood to clot. After centrifugation (15 min, 2,000 × g , RT), the supernatant (serum) was collected, snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.

Snap‐frozen mouse brain hemispheres were homogenized by crunching the brain in liquid nitrogen to fine powder. Approximately 10–20 mg of powdered mouse brain from Grn −/− and wt mice (3–4, 6, 13, 16–18 months of age, female and male mice as indicated in the source data file to fig 2) was homogenized in Tris‐buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma‐Aldrich) and centrifuged for 30 min, 15,000 × g , 4°C. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Scientific), and equal amount of protein was analyzed for TREM2. sTREM2 levels in mouse serum or mouse brain extracts were quantified using the Mesoscale platform essentially as described previously (Kleinberger et al , 2017 ) using 0.25 μg/ml biotinylated polyclonal goat anti‐mouse TREM2 (R&D Systems; BAF1729) as capture antibody and 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti‐TREM2 antibody (R&D Systems, MAB17291) as detection antibody. Calculation of the concentration of sTREM2 was performed with the MSD Discovery Workbench v4 software (MSD).

The murine microglial cell line BV2 (Bocchini et al , 1992 ) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + GlutaMAX™‐ I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 61965‐026) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma‐Aldrich, F7524), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For genome editing, BV2 cells were transfected with pSpCas9(BB)‐2A‐GFP (PX458; gift from Feng Zhang (Ran et al , 2013 ), targeting exons 3 and 4 with the gRNA1 ATAACGAGCCATCATCTAGA and gRNA2 GGCTTCCACTGTAGTGCAGA; Addgene plasmid #48138) by electroporation with the Cell Line Nucleofector ® Kit T (Lonza VACA‐1002) following the manufacturer's instructions. GFP‐positive cells were isolated by FACS 24 h after transfection. Single‐cell clones from the GFP‐positive fraction were obtained by serial dilution and screened for genetic modifications in Grn by PCR amplification of exons 3 and 4. Media and lysates of edited clones were analyzed by Western blot for PGRN expression.

Total RNA was prepared from BV2 cells using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using M‐MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) primers (Life Technologies). The following primer sets from Integrated DNA Technologies were used: mouse Trem2 Mm.PT.58.46092560 (Exon boundary 2 to 4b), mouse Apoe Mm.PT.58.33516165 (Exon boundary 1 to 3), Clec7a Mm.PT.58.42049707 (Exon boundary 1 to 2), and P2ry12 Mm.PT.58.43542033 (Exon boundary 3 to 4). cDNA levels were measured in triplicates using TaqMan assays on a 7500 Fast Real‐Time‐PCR System (Applied Biosystems), normalized to Gapdh cDNA expression, and relative transcription levels of the respective sequences were analyzed using the comparative delta Ct method (7500 Software V2.0.5, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies).

Primary microglia were isolated from adult mouse brain (9 months of age, n = 3 per genotype, female) using MACS Technology (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer's instructions as described previously (Gotzl et al , 2018 ).

Snap‐frozen cell pellets were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g , 4°C for 20 min [RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP‐40, 0.05% Triton X‐100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM ETDA)]. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and equal protein amounts were analyzed in SDS–PAGE. For the detection of PGRN, TREM2, CLEC7A, P2RY12, calnexin, CD68, IBA1, and APP gels were transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Hybond P 0.45 PVDF, GE Healthcare Life Science). For the detection of ApoE, nitrocellulose membranes were used (GE Healthcare Life Science). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in I‐Block™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposed to the following antibodies. In‐house antibodies were as follows: PGRN (Rat 8H10 1/50; Gotzl et al , 2014 ) and TREM2 (Rat 5F4 1/50; (Xiang et al , 2016 )). Commercial antibodies were as follows: CLEC7A (R&D Systems, AF1756, 1/2,000), P2RY12 (Abcam, [EPR18611] (ab184411), 1/1,000) and ApoE (Merck, AB947, 1/2,000), and APPs (Merck, MAB348 clone 22C11, 1/5,000). For immunoblotting in primary microglia: ApoE (HJ6.3, 1/700), kindly provided by David E. Holtzman (Kim et al , 2012 ), CD68 (Abcam, ab125212, 1/1,000), and IBA1 (GeneTex, GTX100042, 1/1,000) were used. HRP‐conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Plus (Pierce™, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for detection. For the quantitatively analysis, images were taken by a Luminescent Image Analyzer Vilber/Peqlab Fusion SL and evaluated with the Multi Gauge V3.0 software (Fujifilm Life Science, Tokyo, Japan).

Assays to determine the phagocytic capacity were carried out as described before (Kleinberger et al , 2014 , 2017 ). Briefly, BV2 cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells per well of a 12‐well dish and 1 day after seeding, incubated with pHrodo green E. coli for 30 and 60 min at 37°C after (pHrodo ® Green E. coli BioParticles ® Thermo Fisher). To analyze E. coli uptake, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA and 1% FBS) and subjected to flow cytometry. Data were acquired using the MACSQuant ® . Cytochalasin D was used as an uptake inhibitor at a final concentration of 10 μM. Phagocytosis assays with primary microglia were performed similar to BV2 cells with the following modifications: Cells were isolated from adult mouse brain (2 months of age, n = 3 per genotype, male) as described above. Following isolation, primary microglia were cultivated in DMEM/F‐12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31330‐038) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Merck, Sigma‐Aldrich), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, M‐CSF (10 ng/ml), and TGF‐β (50 ng/ml). Four days after seeding at a concentration of 100,000 cells per well of a 24‐well plate, cells were incubated with pHrodo for 45 min at 37°C. APC‐Cy™7 Rat Anti‐CD11b (BD Pharmingen™, M1/70, 557657, 1/100) was used as a cell population control.

Organotypic brain slices from postnatal days 6–7 of Grn −/− and wt mice were prepared, cultured, and immunostained as described before (Daria et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Microglial migration was analyzed after 7 days ex vivo as described (Daria et al , 2017 ; Mazaheri et al , 2017 ). Quantification was performed in three independent experiments, each including three biological replicates (three independent slice culture dishes per animal and genotype). From each biological replicate, three defined image regions (775 × 775 μm) of the cortical area in the brain slice were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 20× dry objective. Tile scan images were captured using a 10× dry objective. The number of migrating CD68‐positive microglia and the maximum distance migrated were quantified using Fiji. The migration distance measurements (average of three length measurements per acquired image) were performed on an area defined by two manually drawn lines, one limiting the boarder of the tissue and the other surface covered by at least 90% of migrated microglial cells.

Following deparaffinization and rehydration of paraffin‐embedded brain sections, tissue sections mounted on slides were subjected to citric acid antigen retrieval (1 M sodium citrate in PBS, pH 6.0) and boiled in a microwave for 20 min. After cooling, sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Following this, sections were incubated with primary antibodies against IBA1 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/300) and β‐amyloid (Biolegend, 6E10, 1/300) over two nights at 4°C. Subsequently, sections were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey anti‐rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1/700, donkey anti‐mouse Alexa Fluor 555, 1/1,000, respectively) overnight at 4°C. For the P2RY12 co‐stainings, brains of 9‐month‐old female mice (except one male for Trem2 −/− , n = 3 per genotype) were immerse‐fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h following perfusion. Brains were subsequently cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 48 h. After freezing, 50‐μm‐thick microtome sections were sequentially collected in phosphate buffer saline with 15% glycerol and kept at −80°C until further use. Free‐floating sections were blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in primary antibodies P2RY12 (Biolegend, 1/100) and IBA1 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/300) for two nights at 4°C. Sections were washed and incubated in secondary antibodies (goat anti‐rat Alexa Fluor 555, 1/500, goat anti‐rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1/500) for 3 h at room temperature. Lastly, slides were washed and stained with 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI, 5 μg/ml) before mounting coverslips with ProlongTM Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired using a LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) and the ZEN 2011 software package (black edition, Zeiss). Laser and detector settings were maintained constant for the acquisition of each immunostaining. For analyses, three images were taken per slide using 20× objective (Plan‐Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27) at 2,048 × 2,048 pixel resolution, with Z‐step size of 1 μm at 16 μm thickness. Approximately 150 plaques per genotype were counted using FIJI software (ImageJ) to calculate the number of IBA1‐positive microglia around plaques in the cortex. Microglia coverage was quantified by importing acquired images to FIJI, and data channels were separated (Image\Color\Split Channels). Gaussian filtering was used to remove noise, and intensity distribution for each image was equalized using rolling ball algorithm, which is implemented as background subtraction plug‐in in FIJI. For the feasibility of the quantification, all layers from a single image stack were projected on a single slice (Stack\Z projection). Next, the microglia were segmented using automatic thresholding methods in Fiji with “Moments” thresholding setting. Subsequently, the diameter (25 or 50 μm) around each plaque was selected to calculate the sum number of positive pixels over total number of pixels within the selected area. Data for 50 μm were subtracted from 25 μm to calculate the microglia coverage in the periphery of the plaque only. Data were normalized to age‐matched APPPS1/ Grn +/+ or Grn +/+ controls (4‐month‐old mice; two males and two females per genotype).

All rodent μPET procedures followed an established standardized protocol for radiochemistry, acquisition, and post‐processing (Brendel et al , 2016 ; Overhoff et al , 2016 ). In brief, 18 F‐GE180 μPET with an emission window of 60–90 min p.i. was used to measure cerebral microglial activity and 18 F‐fluordesoxyglucose (FDG) PET with an emission window of 30–60 min p.i. was used for assessment of cerebral glucose metabolism. We studied Grn −/− mice ( n = 6; female, 8 months), Trem2 −/− mice ( n = 6–8; female, 11 months), and wt mice ( n = 7–10; female, 8–11 months) by dual PET. Normalization of injected activity was performed by the previously validated myocardium correction method (Deussing et al , 2017 ) for TSPO‐PET and by percentage of the injected dose (%‐ID) for FDG‐PET. Known changes in TSPO and FDG‐PET during aging (Brendel et al , 2017 ) were accounted to compensate for natural age differences between individual mice. Groups of Grn −/− and Trem2 −/− mice were averaged and compared against wt mice by calculation of %‐differences in each cerebral voxel. Finally, TSPO and FDG‐PET values deriving from a cortical target VOI (Rominger et al , 2013 ) were extracted and compared between groups of different genotype by a one‐way ANOVA including Tukey post hoc correction.

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to PET examination, and the experiments conformed to the principles set out in the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for medical research and the Department of Health and Human Services Belmont Report.

A female patient, 63 years at date of PET, presented with primary progressive aphasia with semantic and non‐fluent features. Genetic testing was performed because of a positive family history (triplet brother with early‐onset dementia). Exome sequencing from blood DNA and data analysis was performed as described before (Kremer et al , 2017 ). In brief, exonic regions were enriched using the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit V6 from Agilent followed by sequencing as 100 bp paired‐end runs on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to an average read depth of 144x. Reads were aligned to the UCSC human reference assembly (hg19) with Burrows–Wheeler algorithm (BWA v.0.5.9). More than 98% of the target sequences were covered at least 20× in all samples. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as small insertions and deletions were detected with SAM tools v.0.1.19. In‐house custom Perl scripts were used for variant annotation. PGRN serum levels measured by ELISA confirmed the GRN mutation carrier. PGRN levels were measured and quantified using the Mesoscale platform essentially as described previously (Capell et al , 2011 ) using a biotinylated polyclonal goat anti‐human PGRN antibody at 0.2 μg/ml (R&D Systems; BAF2420) as capture antibody and a monoclonal mouse anti‐human PGRN antibody at 0.25 μg/ml for detection (R&D Systems, MAB2420). Calculation of the concentration of PGRN was performed with the MSD Discovery Workbench v4 software (MSD). Prior to PET in the patient, the affinity of the TSPO receptor for binding of PET radioligands was assessed by determining the genotype of the SNP rs6971 as previously described (Mizrahi et al , 2012 ; Owen et al , 2012 ).

The patient was scanned at the Department of Nuclear Medicine, University hospital of Munich, by an established TSPO‐PET protocol (Albert et al , 2017 ). In brief, PET was acquired with a PET/CT scanner (Biograph 64, Siemens) 60–80 min after intravenous injection of 187 MBq of 18 F‐GE180. A low‐dose CT scan preceded the PET acquisition and served for attenuation correction. An SUVR image was generated by a global mean scaling and compared visually with TSPO‐PET data deriving from a 56‐year‐old female patient with bvFTD, indicating no mutation in GRN and the same binding affinity status. This patient was scanned secondary to informed consent following the same TSPO‐PET scanning procedure. In this patient, mutations in GRN, TREM2, and MAPT were excluded by panel sequencing as well as the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion by repeat‐primed PCR.

All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7. Data are presented as mean ± SD or SEM as indicated. Statistical significance was calculated by unpaired two‐tailed Student's t ‐test (Figs 1 A–D and 2 B, C, D, H, I and J, and 3 A, C, D and EV1 A and B), one‐way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test (Figs 2 F, 4 A and 5 ) for multiple comparison, and the nonparametric two‐tailed Mann–Whitney U ‐test (Figs 3 F and EV1 C). Statistical evaluations were displayed as follows: n.s. not significant for P > 0.05; statistical significance was assumed at * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; and **** P < 0.0001.

For the μPET experiments, animal numbers were calculated for a significance of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Animal numbers were not changed during the experiments, and no outliers were excluded from datasets. For all experiments, the genotype was unknown to the investigators.

## The paper explained
A number of variants in genes selectively expressed in microglia within the brain are associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Among these genes are progranulin ( GRN ) and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 ), which both cause neurodegeneration by a loss of function. Since many functionally different microglial population exist within the brain and since a loss of TREM2 locks microglia in a homeostatic state, we now investigated the mRNA signature of microglia derived from Grn −/− mice and compared the key microglial functions of Grn −/− and Trem2 −/− mice.

While Trem2 −/− microglia enhance the expression of genes associated with a homeostatic state, microglia derived from Grn −/− mice showed a massive increase in the disease‐associated signature. The opposite mRNA expression profile is reflected by completely divergent functional phenotypes. In contrast to Trem2 −/− mice, phagocytic capacity, migration, clustering around amyloid plaques, and TSPO activation were all greatly stimulated upon loss of PGRN in mice. TSPO activation is also detected in a GRN ‐associated FTLD patient. Albeit opposite functional phenotypes, loss of PGRN and TREM2 both reduce cerebral energy metabolism.

Opposite microglial phenotypes of PGRN and TREM2 loss‐of‐function result in similar wide spread brain dysfunction. Thus, microglia arrested at either end of a gradient of functionally divergent microglial populations cause severe neurological syndromes. Importantly, this narrows the therapeutic window in attempts aiming to modulate microglial activity.
