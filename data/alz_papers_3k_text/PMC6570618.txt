η-Secretase processing of APP inhibits neuronal activity in the hippocampus

# Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 1 . Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote Aβ generation from its precursor (amyloid precursor protein; APP) in a competitive manner 1 . Modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway is currently exploited by anti-Aβ therapeutic strategies 2 . Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events appear to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo 3 . We now identified higher molecular weight C-terminal fragments of APP (CTF-η) in addition to the long-known α- and β-secretase (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ADAM10 and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1) generated CTF-α and CTF-β. Generation of CTF-η is mediated in part by membrane bound matrix-metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as η-secretase activity. η-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504/505 of APP 695 releasing a truncated, soluble APP ectodomain (sAPP-η). Upon shedding of sAPP-η CTF-η is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short Aη peptides (Aη-α and Aη-β). Aη peptides are therefore distinct from N-terminally extended Aβ variants 4 , 5 , since they do not extend to the γ-secretase cleavage sites. η-Secretase produced CTFs are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and human AD brains 6 . Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in a robust accumulation of CTF-η and Aη-α. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced. Strikingly, when recombinant or synthetic Aη-α was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo , LTP was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single cell two-photon calcium imaging revealed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by Aη-α. These findings not only demonstrate a major physiologically relevant APP processing pathway but may also suggest potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.

## Material and methods
Soluble proteins were extracted from brain hemispheres with DEA buffer 47 , membrane proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer or by applying a membrane preparation protocol as described 48 . All Western blot procedures were done essentially as described 49 .

Three-month-old heterozygous female transgenic mice FVB/N x C57Bl/6J expressing APP V717I 32 were used for BACE1 inhibition studies. Gavage mediated administration of BACE1 inhibitor RO5508887 (90 mg/kg, 14.06 ml/kg) or vehicle (14.06 ml/kg) was performed once 50 .

OPTIMEM was used to collect CHO cell supernatants. SEC was performed with concentrated CHO supernatants using a FPLC (ÄKTA purifier) equipped with a Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare). 1 ml samples were collected with a mobile phase flow rate set at 0.5 ml/min in standard ACSF. Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from Swiss mice (PND20-30) and kept in ACSF 51 . Extracellular field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons. After 15-20 minutes of bath application of SEC fractions 52 , LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation. LTP was recorded for 45-60 minutes and statistical analysis was performed on the last 15-20 minutes of recording compared to the baseline fEPSP values.

Two-photon calcium imaging was carried out as described previously 41 . To obtain access to the hippocampus, we carefully removed cortical tissue covering the CA1 region 41 , 53 – 55 . The exposed CA1 region was stained with the calcium indicator fluo-8 AM (0.6 mM) using the multi-cell bolus loading technique 56 . Imaging was performed with a custom-built two-photon microscope equipped with a Ti:sapphire laser system. To assess the effects of Aη peptides on neuronal activity in vivo , the peptides or the respective controls were added to the normal Ringer´s solution used for perfusion of the recording chamber (bath-application technique; 45 to 60 min each wash-in). In a subset of experiments, synthetic Aη-α was applied locally by gentle pressure injection through a glass pipette that was placed close to the neurons of interest (local application technique; 40 s each pressure injection).
