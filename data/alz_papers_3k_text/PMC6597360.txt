# Title
Central nervous system regeneration is driven by microglia
necroptosis and repopulation

# Abstract
Failed regeneration of central nervous system myelin contributes to
clinical decline in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, for which
there is an unmet therapeutic need. Here, we reveal that efficient remyelination
requires death of pro-inflammatory microglia followed by repopulation to a
pro-regenerative state. We propose that impaired microglia death and/or
repopulation may underpin dysregulated microglia activation in neurological
diseases, and reveal novel therapeutic targets to promote white matter
regeneration.

## Methods
Experiments were performed under a UK Home Office project licence issued
under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. Animals were housed at 6 animals
per cage in a 12 hour light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to food and
water. Wild type CD1 mice were used for organotypic cerebellar explant cultures
and C57Bl6/J mice were used for in vivo demyelination
experiments. To track monocyte infiltration into in vivo lesions, we used heterozygous Ccr2 knock-in reporter mice
(B6;129(Cg)- Ccr2 tm2.1lfc /J). For lineage
tracing, Ai9 (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J) were
crossed with C57Bl6-Tg( Nes -CreERT2)KEisc/J to induce tdTomato
expression in Nestin+ cells, or crossed to Cx3cr1 -CreER to
induce tdTomato expression in microglia. Recombination in vivo was induced by 2 subcutaneous injections of tamoxifen (2 mg in 200 µl of
corn oil; Sigma-Aldrich T5648) 48 hours apart, 5-7 days prior to brain
lesioning. Recombination in explants was induced by overnight treatment with 1
µM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by three washes
and an additional 3 media changes over the course of the subsequent week, prior
to demyelination. For live imaging, MacGreen mice (B6N.Cg-Tg(Csf1r-EGFP)1Hume/J)
were used. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for primary microglial cultures. All
animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

Cerebellum and hindbrain were isolated from P0–P2 CD1 mouse pups
of both sexes and sectioned sagittally at 300 μm on a McIlwain tissue
chopper. Explants were plated onto Millipore-Millicell-CM mesh inserts (Fisher
Scientific) in 6-well culture plates at 6 explants per insert for
immunofluorescence or 3 explants per insert for live imaging. Explant culture
media consisted of 50% minimal essential media, 25% heat-inactivated horse
serum, 25% Earle's balanced salt solution (all from GIBCO), 6.5
mgml −1 glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Life Technologies), 1% Glutamax (Life Technologies) and 1% HEPES (Invitrogen),
and was changed every 2–3 days. Demyelination was induced at 21 days in vitro by application of 0.5 mg.ml −1 lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC; Sigma Aldrich) for 18-20 hours which was
subsequently washed off in fresh media for 10 minutes; comparisons were made to
vehicle (phosphate buffered saline; PBS)-treated explants. Necrostatin-1 (10
µM; Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (DMSO; 1:1000) was supplemented to media
upon LPC treatment and in each subsequent media change prior to fixation.
Propidium iodide (25 µg.ml -1 ; Sigma-Aldrich) was supplemented
to the media for the last 1 hour prior to fixation, and explants were washed
thrice in PBS before fixation in the dark. Explants were fixed in 4% PFA for 10
minutes. Each n is the average of 3 explants from 1 litter, with 3 – 5
litters per time point/ condition. Neutralizing antibody against IFNAR2
(R&D Systems, AF1083; 5 µg/ml final concentration), or goat
isotype IgG control of matched concentration, was applied to explants up to 1
and 7 days post-LPC.

Explants were permeabilized and blocked for 1 hour in 5% horse serum and
0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS, and primary antibodies were applied for 2 nights
overnight at 4°C in a humid chamber. Primary antibodies used include rat
anti-CD68 (Abcam, ab53444, 1: 100), rabbit anti-IBA-1 (Wako Chemicals,
019-19741, 1:50), goat anti-PU.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc5949, 1:100),
mouse anti-iNOS (BD Biosciences, 610329, 1:100), goat anti-Arginase-1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, sc18355, 1:50), rabbit anti-RIPK3 (Novus Biologicals,
NBP1-77299, 1:100), rat anti-MLKL (Merck-Millipore, MABC604, 1:100), rabbit
anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen, 559565, 1:100), mouse anti-cleaved
Caspase-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc22165, 1:100), rat anti-myelin basic
protein (MBP; AbD Serotec, MCA409S, 1:250), chicken anti-neurofilament heavy
chain (NF-H; Encor Biotechnology, CPCA-NF-H, 1:10,000), mouse anti-Nestin
(Abcam, ab6142, 1:100), rabbit anti-Olig2 (Merck, AB9610, 1:100), rabbit
anti-GFAP (DAKO, Z0334, 1:500), mouse anti-NeuN (Merck Millipore, MAB377,
1:100), rabbit anti-Musashi-1 (Abcam, ab52865, 1:100), mouse anti-Sox2 (Abcam,
ab171380, 1:100), mouse anti-phospho-STAT1 (P-Y701) (Abcam, ab29045, 1:100).
Subsequent to washes in PBS, fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were
applied for 2 h at 20–25°C in a humid chamber (anti-goat IgG
(A21432, A11055), anti-rabbit IgG (A11034, A21206, A10042, A11011), anti-rat IgG
(A21434, A11006, A21247), anti-mouse IgG (A31570, A21235, A31571, A21042), and
anti-chicken IgG (A11039)) (1:1000, Invitrogen). Explants were counterstained
with Hoechst, mounted on slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern
Biotech). Z-stacks of explants were acquired with an Olympus spinning disk
confocal microscope using a 20X objective with Slidebook 6 software.
Remyelination in explants was assessed by determining area of co-localization of
MBP and NF-H signal normalized to NF-H pixel counts using Volocity 6.3 software
(Perkin Elmer).

An insert with cultured explants was adhered by the feet to a single 4
cm petri dish with molten wax and left briefly to dry. Media was first pipetted
into the petri dish to diffuse under the mesh then gently pipetted onto the
surface of mesh. Z-stacks were acquired using a 20X wet-immersion objective on
the Olympus spinning disk confocal microscope using Slidebook 6 software,
incubated at 37°C (high humidity) and 5% CO 2 . Large Z-stacks
were acquired to ensure the explant was always in focus, and maximum projection
videos are shown.

10 week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane before
being stereotaxically injected with 2 μl of 1% lysolecithin (LPC;
vol/vol) into the corpus callosum. Control mice underwent the same procedure
with a sham injection. Mice were allowed to recover before sacrifice by
perfusion-fixation at 3, 7, and 10 days post LPC (dpl) with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for immunofluorescence, or 3.8% sodium citrate in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) for flow cytometric analysis. The former were post-fixed overnight
with 4% PFA, cryoprotected in sucrose, and cryosectioned at 12 µm
thickness. A minimum of 3 animals were analyzed per time point.

Kolliphor HS15 ® (0.169 g),
Lipoïd ® (0.15 g; Lipoid Gmbh), NaCl (0.0178 g),
Labrafac ® (0.2056 g; Gattefosse SA) and water (0.592 g)
were mixed under gentle magnetic stirring at 50°C for 5 min. The solution
was progressively heated (90°C) and cooled (60°C) three times.
During the last cooling, cold water (2.408 g at 4°C) was added at
72-74°C under high-speed stirring. Necrostatin-1-loaded LNCs were
prepared by adding 25.9 µl of necrostatin-1 stock solution (30 mg/ml in
DMSO) during the last cooling of LNC preparation. Control LNCs were prepared
following the same protocol using DMSO. Fluorescent LNCs
(1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3' Tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,
4-Chlorobenzenesulfonate Salt; DiD; ThermoFisher Scientific) were prepared with
the same protocol using 220 µl of DiD solution (1 mg/ml in absolute
ethanol). The nanoparticles were filtered on a sterile 0.2 µm filter and
stored at 4°C until further use. The concentration of necrostatin-loaded
LNC stock solution was 1 mM of necrostatin-1 and 126 mg/ml of nanoparticles.
Size, ζ-potential and PDI of nanoparticles were measured using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) (N=3, n=3). For the measurement of size
and PDI, samples were diluted 1/100 (v/v) in water. For the measurement of
ζ-potential, samples were diluted 1/100 (v/v) in NaCl 10 mM. The
encapsulation efficiency of necrostatin-1 was calculated by using the following
formula: E n c a p s u l a t i o n E f f i c i e n c y = N e c r o s t a t i n 1 t o t a l ( u g ) − n o n e n c a p s u l a t e d N e c r o s t a t i n 1 ( u g ) N e c r o s t a t i n 1 i n t r o d u c e d i n t h e f o r m u l a t i o n ( u g ) * 100

Necrostatin-1 was extracted from necrostatin-1 LNC by dissolution in
methanol at a ratio 1:20 (v/v) (‘Necrostatin-1 total’).
Necrostatin-1 was quantified by Reverse phase-High Liquid Chromatography
(Waters) with a Macherey-Nagel 125/4 NUCLEODUR 100-5 C 18 column. A gradient
mobile phase was composed of 0.1 % TFA in water (A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile
(B). The gradient was set as follows: for the first 2 min, the gradient was set
at 80% of A and 20% B. Then, A decreased to 60 % for the 3 following minutes and
for the last 2 min, A decreased to 20%. The flow was set for both solutions at 1
ml/min with a volume of injection of 20 μl and the detection wavelength
was set at 269 nm. To determine the percentage of non-encapsulated
necrostatin-1, necrostatin-1 LNCs were centrifuged in a VIVAPSIN 500 with a
membrane that possess a 30 KDa MWCO at 13,000 g for 10 min and the filtered
solution was collected and quantified by Reverse Phase High Liquid
Chromatography. The properties of the LNCs were as follows: i) necrostatin-1
LNCs: 54.2 nm/ 0.05 PDI/ -2.0 mv ζ–potential/ 263.8 µg/ml/
100% encapsulation efficiency, ii) DMSO LNCs: 56.4 nm/ 0.06 PDI/ -1.7 mv
ζ–potential/ 0.86% (vol/vol) concentration, iii) DiD LNCs: 64.1
nm/ 0.08 PDI/ -1.8 mv ζ–potential/ 14.7% (vol/vol) concentration.
LNCs were stereotaxically injected into the corpus callosum of adult mice at the
time of lesioning, and mice sacrificed at 3 or 10 dpl. 3D surface view in
Slidebook 6 was used for 3D rendering to visualize DiD-LNC localization.

Lesioned corpus callosum of 8-12 week old male C57Bl6J mice was
homogenized using a 2 ml Dounce and filtrated (250 µm filter; Pierce).
Following a spin at 600 g for 5 min (with brake), cells were resuspended in 100
% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 33 % Percoll (1:10), overlaid with 1 ml of 10 %
FBS, and spun for 15 min at 800 g at 4°C without brake. The cell pellet
was washed in FACS buffer and spun for 10 min at 600 g at 4°C, and
incubated in anti-mouse CD16/32 Fc-block (Clone 93, BioLegend, 1:200) on ice for
10 min. Fluorescently-conjugated antibodies CD11b-PeCy7 (Clone M1/70,
Invitrogen, 1:100), CD45-BV605 (Clone 30D11, Biolegend, 1:200), Ly6G-PerCP Cy5
(Clone 1A8, BioLegend, 1:200), and CD3-APC (Clone 17A2, BioLegend, 1:200) were
applied on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation and filtration (30
μm), cells were sorted by flow cytometry into FBS-coated Eppendorf tubes
on ice (BD FACSAria Fusion, 100 µm nozzle). Use of differential CD45
expression (on the logarithmic scale) to distinguish between microglia (lo) and
infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages (hi) in white matter injury has been
previously validated using transgenic reporters and bone barrow chimeras. Cells
were spun at 800 g for 5 min, resuspended in RLT Plus buffer with
β-mercaptoethanol, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min in QIAshredder
tubes (Qiagen). RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit (Qiagen)
as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and quantity/quality analyzed
using the Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent) and RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA production/ library preparation was
performed using the NuGEN Ovation RNAseq System v2 kit (NuGEN) by BGI (Hong
Kong). End Repair Mix was added to the amplified cDNA and incubated at
20°C for 30 min. AxyPrep Mag PCR clean up kit (Axygen) was used to purify
the end-repaired DNA, which was then combined with A-tailing Mix (Enzymatic) and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Adaptors (Invitrogen) were ligated to the
Adenylate 3’ ends DNA, and incubated at 16°C for 16 h. Insert size
was used to select the adaptor-ligated DNA fragments. Several rounds of PCR
amplification with PCR Primer cocktail (Invitrogen) and PCR Master Mix (New
England Biolabs) were performed to enrich the adaptor-ligated DNA fragments to
produce the final library, purified using AxyPrep Mag PCR clean up kit (Axygen).
The final library average molecule length was determined using the Bioanalyser
2100 using the DNA 1000 kit (Agilent) and was quantified by real-time qPCR
(TaqMan probe). cBot (Illumina) was used to amplify the libraries to generate
the cluster on the Flow Cell (HiSeq 4000, Illumina). An average of 40 million
clean 100 paired-end reads (read lengths approximately 100 bp) were achieved per
sample, with >91% uniquely mapped reads. Data was processed to remove
adaptors and low quality reads from raw reads.

Raw data analysis was carried out by Fios Genomics Ltd (Edinburgh,
United Kingdom). RNAseq data was pre-processed and aligned to the mouse genome
(GRCm38) using STAR aligner, and the number of mapped read-pairs per gene were
quantified based on the GENCODE vM12 annotation. A total of 6 samples (3 per
time point) were QC analyzed using the ‘array Quality Metrics’
package in Bioconductor. Data were normalized using trimmed mean of M values
(TMM) and transformed using VOOM to Log 2 -counts per million, with
associated precision weights. Comparisons were undertaken using linear modelling
using Limma package in Bioconductor to determine differentially expressed genes
(p<0.05); empirical Bayesian analysis for Log 2 fold change was
applied. Differentially expressed genes were used for functional enrichment
analysis by investigation of Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways (p<0.05), Gene Ontology (GO) terms (p<0.05), Venny 2.1
( http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ ), and
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (p<0.05).

Real-time (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was run
using BioRad Custom PrimePCR plates, as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using 5x iScript Advanced Reaction
Mix and iScript Advanced Reverse Transcriptase (BioRad) at 46 °C for 20
min then 95 °C for 1 min. cDNA samples were mixed with 2x iTaq Universal
SYBR-green Supermix and iScript Reverse Transcriptase. The RT qPCR was performed
at 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 1 min, 95 °C for 15 sec (40
cycles), 60 °C for 60 sec (40 cycles). Data was analyzed using CFX
manager and presented as 2 -ΔCt .

Sections of frozen tissue were air dried for 15 minutes before being
permeabilized and blocked for 1 hour (5% horse serum and 0.3% Triton-X-100 in
PBS) then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in a humid
chamber. Primary antibodies used include rabbit anti-Tmem119 (Abcam, ab209064,
1:100), rat anti-CD68 (Abcam, As53444, 1: 100), rabbit anti-IBA-1 (Wako
Chemicals, 019-19741, 1:50), rabbit anti-RIPK3 (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-77299,
1:100), rat anti-MLKL (Merck-Millipore, MABC604, 1:100), mouse anti-iNOS (BD
Bioscience, 610329, 1:100), goat anti-Arginase-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
sc18355, 1:50), mouse anti-Nestin (Abcam, ab6142, 1:100), mouse anti-MAG (EMD

rabbit anti-IFNAR2 (Abcam, ab56070, 1:100). Subsequent to washes in PBS,
fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 2 h at
20–25°C in a humid chamber (anti-rabbit IgG (A11034, A21206,
A10042, A11011) and anti-rat IgG (A21434, A11006, A21247) all at a concentration
of 1:1000 (all from Invitrogen). Slides were counterstained with Hoechst and
coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were acquired with an
Olympus spinning disk confocal microscope with a 20X or 60X objectives with
Slidebook software. Percentage of IBA-1/ Nestin or Tmem119/ CD68 co-localization
was measured by determining area of co-localization relative to total IBA-1 or
CD68 pixel counts, respectively, using Volocity 6.3 software (Perkin Elmer). MAG
intensity within lesions was quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS4 with
respective background intensity outside the lesion subtracted.

Focal demyelinated lesions of the corpus callosum of 8-12 week old
C57Bl6J male mice were dissected out and homogenized with a 2 ml dounce. A
Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient was used to isolate cells from myelin debris.
Samples were blocked with Fc-block [LEAF-purified anti-mouse CD16/32 (Biolegend,
101321)], then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies CD11b-PeCy7
(eBioscience, 25-0112-82, 1:100) and CD45-BV605 (Biolegend, 103139, 1:100) for
30 minutes on ice, followed by incubation with ‘FITC Annexin-V apoptosis
detection kit with 7-AAD’ for 15 minutes at room temperature (Biolegend,
640922, 1:20). Following washes in buffer, samples were run on the BD LSR
Fortessa (6 laser) analyser, and analysed using FlowJo version 9/10 software
(FlowJo LLC).

Microglia were derived from mixed glial cultures of P0-P3 Sprague-Dawley
rats of both sexes by differential adhesion, as previously described 3 . Cells were plated on
poly- D -lysine-coated 16-well glass chamberslides (Lab-TEK)
at 5 x 10 4 cells per well in Dulbecco’s Modified Essential
Media (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, l-glutamine, pyruvate, 10% fetal calf
serum (vol/vol) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (vol/vol). Treatment included
lysophosphatidyl choline (0.5 mg.ml -1 ), (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to
fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min. Cells were blocked for 1
hour and incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour, for 1
hour at room temperature prior to counterstaining with Hoechst, mounting onto
slides and coverslipping with Fluoromount-G.

Paraffin-embedded sections of tissue from cuprizone-fed mice underwent
deparaffinization using Histoclear (2 x 10 min) and a gradient of ethanol (EtOH)
concentrations, each for 5 minutes in the following order: 2 x 100%, 1 x 95%, 1
x 70% and 1 x 50%, before being washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 3 x 5
minute washes. Slides were then placed in Vector Unmasking Solution under high
heat and pressure for 20 minutes before a final TBS wash. Slides were
permeabilized and blocked for 1 hour (5% horse serum and 0.3% Triton-X-100 in
PBS) before incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in a
humid chamber. Microglia/macrophages were detected with rat anti-CD68 (Abcam,
Ab53444, 1: 100) and cell death was assessed using rabbit anti-RIPK3 (Novus
Biologicals, NBP1-77299, 1:100) and rat anti-MLKL (Merck-Millipore, MABC604,
1:100). Following washes in PBS, fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies
were applied (Invitrogen, 1:1000). Slides were counterstained with Hoechst and
coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were acquired with an
Olympus spinning disk confocal microscope using a 60X objective with Slidebook 6
software. 3 animals were analyzed per time point.

Post-mortem tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls
that died of non-neurological causes were obtained via a UK prospective donor
scheme with full ethical approval from the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank
(MREC/02/2/39) and their use was in accord with the terms of the informed
consents. Diagnosis of MS was confirmed by neuropathological means by F.
Roncaroli (Imperial College London) and clinical history was provided by R.
Nicholas (Imperial College London). Snap frozen unfixed tissue blocks (2
× 2 × 1 cm) were cut at 10 μm and stored at
−80°C. Lesions were classified according to the International
Classification of Neurological Disease using Luxol Fast Blue staining and CD68+
immunoreactivity. Following washes in 0.1% Tween-20 (vol/vol) in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS), sections were microwaved in Vector unmasking solution for 10
minutes, washed once, and endogenous phosphatase and peroxidase activity blocked
for 5 minutes (Bloxall, Vector). Tissue was incubated with primary antibodies in
a humid chamber overnight. Sections were then washed in TBS and stains
visualized by Vector Blue substrate kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (maximum 15 minutes). For co-staining, sections were washed thrice
and re-blocked to quench any remaining phosphatase activity (Bloxall, Vector)
prior to application of primary antibody then developed using Vector Red
substrate kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (maximum 15
minutes). Following washes in water, the sections were counterstained with
Hoechst and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G. Primary antibodies used include
goat anti- CD68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc7082, 1:100), mouse anti-Nestin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc23927, 1:100), goat anti-PU.1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc5949, 1:100), rat anti-MLKL (Merck-Millipore, MABC604, 1:100)
and rat anti-RIPK3 (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-77299, 1:100). Entire tissue
sections were imaged using a Zeiss AxioScan Z.1 SlideScanner, and digital lesion
maps were prepared for each tissue in Zeiss Zen2 software using Luxol Fast
Blue-stained sections. Fields of 360 μm × 360 μm were
counted per lesion and counts were multiplied to determine density of
immunopositive cells per mm 2 . For quantification of Nestin+ PU.1+
cells, staining with blood vessel morphology was excluded from counts.

Details on experimental design and reagents can be found in the Life
Sciences Reporting Summary. For animal experiments, power was calculated by
two-sided 95% confidence interval using the normal approximation method using
OpenEpi software and gave between 88-100% power for all experiments. Animals
were randomly selected for experimental groups, and littermates were compared
for all treatment groups. All manual cell counts for explants cultures, in vivo lesioned tissue, and MS tissue were performed in a
blinded manner. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. from a minimum of 3
mice ( in vivo experiments) or litters (explants). Data
distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data was
statistically analyzed by 2-tailed Student’s t -test or
Mann-Whitney test for ≤2 comparisons, one sample t -test
for analysis of normalized data or comparison to sham, and either Kruskal-Wallis
test with Dunn’s Multiple Comparison post-test or One-way ANOVA with
Sidak’s post-test (for select comparisons between groups) for ≥3
comparisons. P values of ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant
at a confidence interval of 95%. Data handling and statistical processing was
performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 7 and 8 Software. Diagrams
were created with BioRender software.
