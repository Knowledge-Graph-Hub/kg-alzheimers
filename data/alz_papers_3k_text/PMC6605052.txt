# Title
Senolytic therapy alleviates Aβ-associated oligodendrocyte
progenitor cell senescence and cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer’s
disease model

# Abstract
Neuritic plaques, a pathological hallmark in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) brains, comprise extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ)
peptide and degenerating neurites that accumulate autolysosomes. We found that,
in the brains of patients with AD and in AD mouse models, Aβ
plaque-associated Olig2- and NG2-expressing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(OPCs), but not astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes, exhibit a
senescence-like phenotype characterized by the upregulation of p21/CDKN1A,
p16/INK4/CDKN2A proteins, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase
activity. Molecular interrogation of the Aβ plaque environment revealed
elevated levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in OPC function,
replicative senescence, and inflammation. Direct exposure of cultured OPCs to
aggregating Aβ triggered cell senescence. Senolytic treatment of AD mice
selectively removed senescent cells from the plaque environment, reduced
neuroinflammation, lessened Aβ load, and ameliorated cognitive deficits.
Our findings suggest a role for Aβ-induced OPC cell senescence in
neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in AD, and a potential therapeutic
benefit of senolytic treatments.

## Results
To determine whether OPCs are associated with Aβ plaques, we used
antibodies recognizing Aβ, Olig2 (OPC marker) and CDKN1A (p21; a senescence
marker and transcriptional target of p53), to perform triple-label immunostaining of
brain tissue sections from the inferior parietal cortex of eight patients with AD,
eight patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and eight age-matched,
neurologically normal, non-demented control (NDC) subjects (see Supplementary Table 1 for subject age,
gender, and Braak/neurofibrillary tangle staging). To reduce autofluorescence and
enhance signal-to-noise ratios in fixed human tissue, deparaffinized sections were
pretreated with boiling citrate buffer and 75% formic acid before immunostaining
(see Supplementary Fig. 1 ).
As expected, Aβ plaques were most abundant in patients with AD, less abundant
in patients with MCI, and relatively sparse in NDC groups ( Fig. 1a , b ). More than
80% of larger Aβ plaques in AD cases (size > 50 μm) contained
cells that were immunoreactive with both Olig2 and p21 antibodies; very few or no
cells expressed p21 but not Olig2 ( Fig. 1a ). In
contrast, significantly fewer plaques in MCI and NDC subjects exhibited cells
co-expressing Olig2 and p21 ( Fig. 1a , b ). The senescence phenotype of the OPCs was also
confirmed using antibodies against a different OPC marker (NG2) and the
p53-independent senescence marker p16/INK4/CDKN2A (p16) ( Fig. 1c ). Senescence marker-positive OPCs were observed in
both central and peripheral regions of plaques ( Fig.
1a , c ). In contrast to OPCs, AD
plaque-associated astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive
cells) and microglia (Iba1-immunoreactive cells) did not exhibit a senescence
phenotype (see Supplementary Fig.
2 ).

A common marker of cellular senescence 17 , senescence-associated β-galactosidase
(SA-βGal) activity, becomes detectable as a result of elevated expression of
lysosomal β- D -galactosidase in response to lysosomal
stress 18 , 19 . However, SA-βGal is undetectable in
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human tissues. To circumvent this problem, we
employed transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein
(APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1), which cause early onset, familial AD (APP/ PS1 mutant
mice) 20 . We stained
free-floating brain sections from 7.5-month-old APP/PS1 mutant mice for
SA-βGal activity, followed by post-fixation in paraformaldehyde and Aβ
immunohistochemistry. As expected, Aβ plaques were abundant in the
hippocampus and cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mutant mice and were absent in
age-matched wild-type controls ( Fig. 2a , b ). SA-βGal + cells were
associated with large (>40 μm) Aβ plaques in the entorhinal
cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice ( Fig.
2b ). Aβ plaques and plaque-associated SA-βGal staining was
negligible in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but increased significantly by age 7.5
months ( Fig. 2c , d ; see Supplementary
Fig. 3 ). Except for neurons, which have previously been reported to
exhibit diffuse SA-βGal positivity unrelated to other replicative senescent
phenotypes 21 ,
SA-βGal staining was not observed in the hippocampus of wild-type mice ( Fig. 2a ).

As Aβ deposits accumulate extracellularly, we examined the spatial
relationship between senescent cells and Aβ plaques. We employed a
high-resolution three-dimensional confocal in situ hybridization (RNAscope-ISH)
method to determine whether cells expressing p16 mRNA were present
within and/or surrounding Aβ plaques. We first validated the method by
hybridizing negative and positive control probes in 10-μm frozen brain
sections from 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice (see Supplementary Fig. 4a , b ). We then examined a probe that
specifically recognized the mRNA encoding p16 in hippocampal sections of wild-type
and APP/PS1 mice. We observed that, in APP/PS1 brain sections, p16 mRNA puncta were clustered in Aβ-associated cells ( Fig. 2e ; see Supplementary Videos 1 – 3 ). As controls, p16 mRNA was rare or absent in regions lacking Aβ
plaques in APP/PS1 mutant mice, and in wild-type mice ( Fig. 2e and see Supplementary Fig. 4c , d ). In Supplementary
Video 1 p16 mRNA is shown in green, Aβ immunoreactivity in red, and
cell nuclei in blue (DAPI). In Supplementary Videos 2 and 3 p16 mRNA is shown in green and LAMP1 protein immunoreactivity in pink or cyan.

Next, we examined the cell type identity of senescent cells. We generated a
novel senescence reporter mouse that expresses a bright-green fluorescent protein
(ZsGreen) under the control of mouse p16 promoter (see Supplementary Fig. 5a – c and see Methods ), and then crossed this mouse line with APP/PS1
double-mutant transgenic mice (see Supplementary Fig. 5d ), hereafter referred to as ZsGreen/APPPS1 mice. We
found that, in ZsGreen/APPPS1 mouse brains, the localization of ZsGreen cells in
Aβ plaques was age dependent, similar to our results in brain sections of
APP/PS1 mice double labeled with SA-βGal activity and Aβ
immunostaining ( Fig. 2d and see Supplementary Fig. 3 ). At 2.5 months of
age, Aβ immunoreactivity was scarcely visible as diffuse deposits, and cells
expressing ZsGreen were rare and not associated with Aβ (see Supplementary Fig. 5e ). At 4.5 months
of age, large Aβ plaques (size>30μm) harbored ZsGreen cells
that co-localized with the OPC marker Olig2 and SA-βGal in the cerebral
cortex (see Supplementary Fig.
5f ). Using an additional panel of glial cell-type-specific antibodies,
including CNP for myelinating oligodendrocytes, GFAP for astrocytes, and Iba1 for
microglia, we quantitatively validated the glial cell identity of
ZsGreen + senescent cells in Aβ plaques. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Table 1 , 100% of Aβ-associated
ZsGreen + cells were Olig2 + OPCs, whereas neither
GFAP-expressing astrocytes nor Iba1-expressing microglia were ZsGreen + .
In addition, ~93% of Aβ-associated oligodendrocytes were
ZsGreen-negative.

Because OPCs exhibit a senescent phenotype in the Aβ plaque
environment in patients with AD (see Fig. 1 ),
we next determined whether OPC lineage markers were associated with senescence
markers in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. As a control, p21 immunoreactive
cells were not observed in the hippocampus of wild-type mice (data not shown). In
APP/PS1 mouse brains, NG2- and Olig2-OPC markers co-localized with p21 and p16
immunoactivities in cells associated with Aβ plaques ( Fig. 2f ; see Supplementary Figs. 7a and 8 ). On the other hand,
GFAP + astrocytes and Iba1 + microglia associated with
plaques were not immunoreactive with p16 antibody (see Supplementary Fig. 7b , c ), consistent with the results from
our analysis of ZsGreen/APP/PS1 mouse brains (see Supplementary Fig. 6a , b ) and human AD brains (see Supplementary Fig. 2 ). As
damage to myelinating oligodendrocytes can be a stimulus for the recruitment of OPCs
to lesion sites 14 – 16 , we examined the presence of myelin in
Aβ plaques of APP/PS1 mouse brains using an anti-myelin basic protein (MBP)
antibody. Whereas MBP immunoreactivity associated with presumptive axons was
abundant in areas devoid of plaques, the Aβ plaques themselves exhibited
little or no MBP immunoreactivity (see Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Taken together,
the data suggest that Aβ-associated OPCs undergo replicative senescence, a
previously uncharacterized pathway that would be expected to compromise
remyelination in the Aβ plaque environment.

To interrogate the molecular features of plaque-associated cells, we used
laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate plaque areas and extract RNA to
identify expressed mRNAs by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR)
analysis (see Supplementary Fig.
10 ). As Aβ plaques are concentrated in the forebrain but not the
cerebellum of APP/PS1 mice 20 , we
compared forebrain plaque LCM samples with similarly sized, plaque-free tissue from
APP/PS1 mouse cerebellum and wild-type mouse forebrain as negative controls. The hAPP1 mRNA served as a transgene positive control. Compared
with plaque-free forebrain tissue from wild-type mice and cerebellar tissue from
APP/PS1 mutant mice, LCM plaques were significantly enriched in mRNAs encoding
proteins involved in AD pathogenesis 2 , 3 ( hAPP1 , Mapt , Psen1 , Notch1 , and Bace2 mRNAs), OPC lineage
( Cspg4 mRNA, which encodes NG2, Olig1 , and Olig2 mRNAs) 13 – 16 , 22 , cellular senescence
( Cdkn2a mRNA, which encodes p16), and inflammation (Il1b and Tnfα mRNAs, which encode
interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, respectively) 2 ( Fig.
3a ). Several transcripts upregulated in the plaque environment encode
proteins that would be expected to enhance amyloidogenesis ( App and Psen1 mRNAs) and/or induce OPC senescence
( Tgfa , IL1b , and Cdkn2a mRNAs).

The findings described above indicate that aggregating Aβ may trigger
OPC senescence. To test this possibility, we generated OPCs from cultured mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESCs) expressing GFP-Olig2 (see Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and exposed them
to aggregating Aβ 1–42 . Whereas no OPCs exhibited
SA-βGal activity in control cultures, approximately 10% of the cells
exhibited strong SA-βGal activity in cultures exposed to
Aβ 1–42 . It was interesting that multiple enlarged
SA-βGal + cells were often located adjacent to each other
( Fig. 3b ). These findings further support a
notion that aggregating Aβ 1–42 directly triggers OPC
senescence, independently of the presence of any other plaque-associated cell
types.

To elucidate the ultrastructural features of senescent OPCs and their
spatial relationship to Aβ deposits, we employed a double preembedding
immunoelectron microscopy technique (see Methods ). We examined seven plaque-laden areas (0.5–1
mm 2 ) in the cerebral cortex of two APP/PS1 mice. In regions where no
Aβ deposits were present, Olig2 immunoreactivity (as detected by
silver-enhanced gold particles) was localized only in the nucleus of OPCs ( Fig. 3c ). No Olig2 immunoreactivity was observed
in presumptive astrocytes (based on their nuclear morphology), supporting the
specificity of the Olig2 immunogold labeling method. In contrast to the areas devoid
of Aβ aggregates, plaque-associated OPCs exhibited Olig2 immunoreactivity in
the cytoplasm, and these cells were often intimately associated with closely apposed
Aβ deposits ( Fig. 3d and see Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). All 24 of 24
Aβ plaque-associated OPCs exhibited cytosolic Olig2, whereas, in all 7 OPCs
examined, which were not associated with plaques, the Olig2-associated gold
particles were located exclusively in the nucleus. As Olig2 is a transcription
factor that plays an important role in the differentiation of OPCs into
oligodendrocytes 23 , 24 , the displacement of Olig2 from
the nucleus may be linked to the acquisition of a senescence phenotype of OPCs in
the Aβ plaque microenvironment. Consistent with the accumulation of
LAMP1 + autolysosomes 25 – 27 in
senescent cells associated with Aβ plaques ( Fig. 2e and see Supplementary Fig. 8c , d ), and with evidence that Aβ can directly induce OPC senescence
( Fig. 3b ), our ultrastructural analysis
revealed a dramatic accumulation of autolysosomes in Olig2 immunogold-labeled cells
associated with Aβ plaques ( Fig. 3d and
see Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). We also observed
dystrophic neurites with accumulations of cargo-laden autolysosomes 28 directly adjacent to Olig2-labeled
OPCs ( Fig. 3e ).

A cocktail of two US Federal Drug Administration (FDA)- approved
‘senolytic’ compounds, dasatinib and quercetin (D + Q), can
selectively eliminate senescent cells from pathological tissues 10 , 29 , 30 , and may thereby counteract
age-related pathogenic processes 7 – 10 . Dasatinib
was originally developed as an anti-cancer drug, whereas quercetin is a flavonoid
found in many fruits and vegetables. To confirm that D + Q selectively kills
senescent cells, we first employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using
dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β- D -galactopyranoside
(C 12 FDG), a fluorogenic β-galactosidase substrate for detecting
SA-βGal activity (see Supplementary Fig. 14 ) 19 , along with propidium iodidebased quantification of cell death.
To induce classic senescence, Neuro2a (N2a) cells were first exposed to 10 Gy of
ionizing radiation, and 5 days later were treated with D + Q for 24 h before FACS
analysis. We observed that the decline of senescent cells caused by D + Q was
negatively correlated with an increase in cell death in a manner dependent on the
dose of D + Q ( Fig. 4a ). We also found that
levels of cleaved caspase-3 increased in response to D + Q treatments, suggesting
apoptotic cell death ( Fig. 4a ; see Supplementary Fig. 14 ).
Furthermore, we observed that, whereas OPCs underwent senescence in response to D +
Q exposure, non-senescent OPCs were not killed by D + Q (see Supplementary Fig. 15b , c ).

We next determined whether oral administration of D + Q would kill Aβ
plaque-associated senescent OPCs in APP/PS1 AD mice. First, we tested the
blood-brain barrier permeability of dasatinib and quercetin in 5-month-old APP/PS1
mice receiving dasatinib (12 mg kg −1 ) and quercetin (50 mg
kg −1 ) by oral gavage. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that
both compounds were readily detectable in the hippocampus and cerebellum of APP/PS1
mice 2 h after D + Q administration (see Supplementary Fig. 16 ; data not shown).
Next, we designed an experiment in which we administered D + Q once daily for 9 days
and then quantified Aβ load and Aβ-plaque-associated OPCs, astrocytes,
and microglia ( Fig. 4b ; see Supplementary Fig. 17 ). We found that
this short-term D + Q treatment had no significant effect on Aβ load.
Instead, it significantly reduced SA-βGal activity associated with Aβ,
as well as the levels of Olig2 and p21 ( Fig.
4c ). RNAscope-ISH analysis revealed a highly significant decrease in the
levels of Aβ-plaque-associated p16 mRNA in AD mice treated
with D + Q compared with those treated with vehicle ( Fig. 4d ). We also found that acute D + Q administration triggered
apoptosis (with a rise in cleaved caspase-3) of SA-βGal-reactive cells
associated with Aβ plaque in APP/PS1 mouse brains, but not in the hippocampus
of wild-type mice (see Supplementary Fig. 18 ). Taken together, these in vivo results
demonstrate a target-specific effect of acute D + Q treatment on senescent OPCs
similar to a recent study using a model of adipose cell senescence 10 .

Next, we took advantage of the ZsGreen/APPPS1 p16 reporter mouse AD model
( Fig. 4e ), and treated these mice for 9
days with D + Q or vehicle and then performed triple-label confocal imaging to
establish whether D + Q treatment removed senescent cells, and whether elimination
of senescent cells affected plaque-associated inflammation, microglia activation,
and/or astrocyte activation. As it was difficult to discern precisely how many
senescent cells were involved in forming the senescent cell foci in Aβ
plaques (see Supplementary Fig.
6a ) due to the high concentration of closely packed cells (see Fig. 2e ), we quantified the amount of ZsGreen
(p16 reporter) fluorescence/plaque. Treatment with D + Q significantly reduced the
amount of Aβ plaque-associated ZsGreen expression ( Fig. 4f – h ).
Senolytic treatment had no significant effect on the numbers of microglia or
astrocytes associated with Aβ plaques ( Fig.
4f – h and see Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20 ). However, microglia in
the vehicle group exhibited a condensed morphology with relatively large cell bodies
characteristic of an activated inflammatory phenotype ( Fig. 4f and see Supplementary Fig. 20 ), whereas microglia in D + Q-treated groups
exhibited deactivated morphologies with ramified processes ( Fig. 4g and see Supplementary Fig. 20 ). This microglial
deactivation occurred coincident with the reduction of plaque-associated ZsGreen
protein and interleukin-6 protein levels in response to acute D + Q exposure ( Fig. 4h and see Supplementary Fig. 21 ). Interleukin-6
production is a key feature of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) 10 . These data
suggest the involvement of the ZsGreen cells and their pharmacological response in
local inflammation and microglial activation in the Aβ plaque environment.
Although a recent study suggested that astrocytes can acquire a senescence-like
phenotype in patients with AD and in a tau-proteopathy animal model 11 , 31 , we did not observe co-localization of astrocytes with cell
senescence markers in Aβ plaques (see Supplementary Figs. 6b , 7b , 8a , and 9 ), and senolytic treatment did not
reduce the numbers of plaque-associated astrocytes ( Fig. 4c ). In addition, there were no clear effects of D + Q treatment on
the morphologies of Aβ plaque-associated astrocytes in our model (see Supplementary Figs. 17b and 19 ).

In peripheral organs, partial elimination of senescent cells (~30%)
is sufficient to restore tissue homeostasis and function in disease models and
during aging 7 , 29 , 30 .
We next determined whether longterm intermittent senolytic treatment could
ameliorate Aβ plaque pathology and/or improve cognition in APP/PS1 mice.
Beginning at 3.5 months of age, female APP/PS1 AD mice were treated with either D +
Q or vehicle once weekly for 11 weeks ( Fig.
5a ). Hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were evaluated by
testing the mice in the Y maze immediately before, and at the 6- and 11-week
treatment time points, and mice were also tested in the water maze during treatment
week 10. Mice were euthanized at 11 weeks and their brains processed for biochemical
(one hemisphere) and histological (the other hemisphere) analyses.
Aβ-plaque-associated SA-βGal activity in the hippocampus was greatly
reduced in the AD mice that received the senolytic treatment compared with
vehicle-treated AD mice ( Fig. 5b ). There was a
significant reduction of Aβ-plaque-associated Olig2-immunoreactive cells in
senolytic-treated AD mice, whereas there were no differences in numbers of
Aβ-plaque-associated microglia and astrocytes (see Supplementary Fig. 21 ) in the D +
Q-treated AD mice compared with vehicle-treated AD mice ( Fig. 5b ). Unlike the acute D + Q treatment, there was a
highly significant reduction in Aβ plaque load in the hippocampus of D +
Q-treated AD mice compared with vehicle-treated AD mice ( Fig. 5b ). We also found that senolytic treatment reduced
levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in the hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex of D + Q-treated AD mice compared with vehicle-treated AD mice
( Fig. 5c ), suggesting potential effects of
the senolytic treatment on Aβ production and/or clearance. Consistent with A
reduction in plaque-associated interleukin-6 levels in response to senolytic
treatment (see Supplementary Fig.
20 ), the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α) were significantly lower in the hippocampus of D + Q-treated AD mice
compared with vehicle-treated AD mice ( Fig.
5d ). The IL-1β concentration in the entorhinal cortex was also
significantly reduced in response to D + Q treatment. Interferon-γ
concentrations were unaffected by D + Q treatment ( Fig. 5d ). Compared with vehicle-treated APP/PS1 AD mice, APP/ PS1 AD
mice treated with D + Q performed significantly better in the Y maze at both the 6-
and the 11-week time points ( Fig. 5f ). In the
water maze tests, D + Q treatment enhanced memory acquisition (more rapid learning
of the location of the hidden platform) and memory retention in the probe trial
( Fig. 5e ).

## Discussion
Our findings herein suggest that: (1) senescent cells that express OPC
marker proteins are present in the Aβ plaque environment in the brains of
patients with AD and the Aβ mouse AD model; (2) in Aβ plaques, OPCs
become senescent with a proinflammatory phenotype, and in that state may be unable
to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes; (3) aggregating Aβ can
act directly on OPCs to induce cellular senescence; (4) short-term (9 days)
senolytic treatment removes p16-expressing OPCs from Aβ plaques in APP/PS1
mutant AD mice; (5) senolytic treatment reduces levels of
Aβ-plaque-associated proinflammatory cytokine and microglial activation; (6)
long-term (11 weeks), intermittent, senolytic treatment reduces neuroinflammation
and Aβ plaque size, suggesting that senescent cells accelerate the
development of Aβ pathology; and (7) senolytic treatment ameliorates
hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits in the APP/PS1 AD mice,
suggesting a role for cell senescence in the cascade of events by which Aβ
accumulation causes cognitive impairment in AD ( Fig.
5g ).

Although AD is defined histopathologically by the accumulation of
extracellular Aβ plaques and associated intraneuronal accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, a rarer dementing disorder called frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) is characterized by pTau tangles without Aβ plaques 32 . When the present manuscript was
under review, two other laboratories provided evidence that astrocytes and microglia
exhibit features of senescence in FTD tau mutant mice 11 , 12 .
However, we did not detect astrocytes or microglia with senescent phenotypes in
Aβ plaque microenvironments in the brains of APP/PS1 mice and human patients
with AD. The FTD mouse studies employed SA-βGal staining as a marker of
senescent cells in brain tissue sections. Although SA-βGal is widely used as
a marker of senescence, some non-dividing cells, including neurons in the brains of
young and aged wild-type mice, also exhibit relatively robust SA-βGal
staining 21 , emphasizing
the necessity of using more specific markers of senescence. To this end, we employed
the p16 RNAscope-ISH technique and a novel ZsGreen/APPPS1 AD p16
reporter mouse line, along with a panel of senescence antibodies (p16 and p21) and
glial antibody markers (OPCs, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes). The
results from the studies of the tau mice 11 , 12 and our analyses
of APP/PS1 mice with Aβ plaques provide complementary insight into the
responses of different types of glial cells to Aβ and tau pathologies. We
observed an OPC senescence response to extracellular Aβ, and the other
laboratories found astrocyte and microglial senescent responses to intracellular
pTau pathology. Using a genetic approach 11 or FDA-approved D + Q senolytic drugs 12 , the three studies demonstrate that the
clearance of senescent cells is beneficial for ameliorating AD-related pathological
phenotypes. It will therefore be of interest to elucidate mechanisms by which
Aβ and pTau pathologies differentially affect OPCs, astrocytes, microglia,
and oligodendrocytes in future studies. Nevertheless, the emerging findings
therefore suggest that senescent cells contribute to the dysfunction and
degeneration of neurons in AD and FTD.

Cellular senescence has been most extensively studied in peripheral tissues
where cell turnover (proliferation, differentiation, and cell death) is robust. In
such tissues, senescent cells accumulate during normal aging, and their SASP is
believed to contribute to age-related tissue inflammation 33 . In contrast to proliferative tissues, the
major cell populations in the brain are either postmitotic (neurons) or quiescent
(astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia). Although there are neuronal stem
cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, OPCs are
the major proliferative cell in most brain regions 32 . In response to ischemic and traumatic brain
injuries, OPCs migrate into the damaged tissue where they can differentiate into
oligodendrocytes and remyelinate damaged axons 34 . In multiple sclerosis, OPCs can remyelinate axons in the
early phase of the disease, but ultimately fail as the disease progresses 35 – 37 . It will therefore be of interest to determine whether OPC
senescence contributes to neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis. Our data suggest
that OPCs undergo senescence in the Aβ plaque environment, where they may
contribute to local inflammation and associated damage to neurons. Cellular
senescence many also play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders, as suggested
by a recent study that provides evidence that astrocytes undergo senescence in an
animal model of Parkinson’s disease 38 .

We found that when cultured OPCs are exposed to aggregating
Aβ 1–42 many of the cells undergo senescence,
demonstrating that a high concentration of aggregating Aβ is sufficient to
trigger cell senescence. In the brains of APP/PS1 mutant AD mice, senescent cells
that express OPC markers (Olig2 and NG2) are present in the Aβ plaque
environment, but not in regions devoid of Aβ, consistent with
Aβ-inducing cell senescence. Our double-labeling immuno-histochemical
analyses and analyses of p16 reporter mice suggest that the plaque-associated
senescent cells are not microglia or astrocytes. We found that D + Q senolytic
treatment kills senescent OPCs in culture, and removes senescent cells from the
Aβ plaque environment in AD mice. The senolytic treatment resulted in a
reduction in levels of proinflammatory cytokines which may be due, in part, to
removal of OPCs with an SASP. However, direct anti-inflammatory effects of dasatinib
and/or quercetin on microglia and astrocytes are also possible. In this regard, it
will be of interest to cross AD mouse models with the recently reported transgenic
mouse line in which p16-expressing cells can be selectively eliminated 8 , 9 to further elucidate roles for cell senescence in AD
pathogenesis.

Using two different tests of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we
found that long-term intermittent senolytic treatment improved cognition in APP/PS1
AD mice. This beneficial effect of senolytic therapy on brain function was
associated with reduced Aβ plaque load in the hippocampus and reduced
neuroinflammation. Both Aβ and inflammatory cytokines can impair synaptic
plasticity 1 , 38 – 40 , suggesting that the beneficial effects of senolytic treatment
on cognition may result from suppression of inflammation and Aβ
neurotoxicity. Whether the effect of D + Q on cognition results solely from removal
of senescent cells or also involves actions of dasatinib or quercetin on neurons
remains to be determined. Nevertheless, our findings pave the way for future
preclinical and clinical studies that will test the hypothesis that senolytic
therapies can suppress neuropathology and preserve brain function in AD and other
age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

## Methods
Male APP/PS1 transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Tg(APPswe,PSENldE9)85Dbo; stock no.
34832), and age-and gender-matched wild-type controls, were obtained from the
Jackson Laboratories. For generating a senescence reporter mouse line, the
ZsGreen reporter gene driven by the pl6 promoter was made as described
previously 7 except for
a replacement of ATTAC by ZsGreen. In brief, a 2,617-base-pair segment of the
murine pl6 promoter was amplified by PCR from the C57B6 genomic DNA using
Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) to replace a P2 promoter in a P2-ATTAC
transgenic construct (a gift from P. Sherer), followed by subcloning the ZsGreen
cDNA (Addgene, catalog no. 18121) to replace the ATTAC segment in pBlueScriptll.
The inserts of pl6 promoter and ZsGreen were validated by full-range DNA
sequencing and restriction mapping. Two transgenic founders were obtained by
pronuclear injection of the p16 promoter-ZsGreen construct into FVB oocytes. A
PCR-based method was used to identify the ZsGreen transgene (primer sequences
are available upon request). ZsGreen females were mated with APP/PS1 males.
Littermates with APP/PS1/ZsGreen were identified by PCR- based genotyping and
used for pharmacological analysis at 5 months of age. The breeding colony was
established in the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program
vivarium. Mice were anesthetized with isofiurane and sequentially perfused
transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. The fixed and sucrose-cryoprotected brain tissue was cut horizontally with
a sliding microtome (Microm, HM440E) into 40-μm sections. All procedures
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on
Aging Intramural Research Program.

Sixteen 3.5-month-old female APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly
assigned to treatments by oral gavage with dasatinib and quercetin (Selleckchem)
or vehicle once weekly for 11 weeks. Ten mixed gender, 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice,
and eight 5-month-old APP/PS1/ZsGreen mice were randomly assigned to acute D + Q
treatment with one dose daily for 4 days in the first week and 5 days in the
second week. Dasatinib and quercetin were first dissolved in polyethylene glycol
(PEG, Sigma-Aldrich) by sonication for 5 min, at a final concentration of 12 mg
kg −1 of dasatinib and 50 mg kg −1 of
quercetin in 20% PEG with 0.9% saline for treatment weeks 4–11. During
the first 3 weeks the mice were treated with the same dose of D + Q in 30% PEG
in distilled water, and this vehicle caused sickness behaviors in two of the
mice. To test the blood-brain barrier permeabilities of D + Q, two APP/PS1 mice
were subjected to D + Q oral administration and 2 h later the mice were perfused
with 60 ml of cold PBS, and the hippocampus, cerebellum, and blood plasma were
collected for measuring dasatinib levels by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
analysis using a Turbo Ion Spray module Sciex API 3000 triple-stage, quadrupole
tandem mass spectrometer (ES/MS/MS; Sciex Inc.). We found that quercetin
underwent considerable metabolism within 2h of oral gavage (data not shown),
similar to what has previously been reported 41 .

Paraffin-embedded blocks of human postmortem tissue containing the
inferior parietal lobule from people with AD, MCI, and NDC were acquired from
the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and were
from well-characterized subjects with cognitive test results, Aβ plaque
load, and Braak staging (see Supplementary Table 1 ).

cleaved caspase-3 (Asp 175 ) (Cell Signaling; catalog no. 9661) at
1:1,000. The dye FSB was purchased from EMD Millipore and used at a dilution of
1:1,000. References to prior studies using these antibodies are cited in the
text and/or are available at the vendor’s website.

Staining for SA-βGal was performed on free-floating mouse brain
sections in the SA-βGal staining solution at 37 °C for
20–24h. The sections were briefly rinsed in PBS and then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min before processing for immunofluorescence. For
counterstaining Aβ plaques, FSB, a derivative of Congo red-like, was
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide as a 10 mM stock and stored at −20
°C. After immunofluorescence staining, the sections were immersed in 1
μM FBS in PBS for 20 min, and examined with confocal microscopy using
excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 511 nm. For immunohistochemical
examinations, sections were pretreated with 1%H 2 O 2 in PBS
for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After blocking non-specific
antigenicity with a blocking buffer (5% house serum, 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and 0.2% Triton 100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, sections were
incubated with anti-Aβ antibody overnight at 4°C, then incubated
with a biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:200 dilution, Vector
Laboratories). The antibody complex was detected using the peroxidase ABC system
with DAB as the substrate following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Vector Laboratories). The sections were examined and images were acquired using
a Nikon bright-field microscope (Nikon, Ellipse E600) with ×5,
×20,and ×40 objectives. Human brain tissue sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated in boiling citrate buffer (10 mM citric
acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for 10 min in a microwave, and then incubated in
75% formic acid (Sigma) for 10 min before immunofluorescence staining.

Free-floating mouse brain sections were incubated with blocking buffer
(3% BSA, 5% normal serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h, and then
incubated with combinations of primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight
at 4°C. After thorough washes in PBS, sections were incubated with 1:400
dilution of Alexa 488-, Alexa 568-, and Alexa 647-conjugated secondary
antibodies appropriate for the species of the primary antibodies, followed by
FSB or DAPI counterstains. The sections were examined and images acquired using
Leica-LMD7000, and Zeiss LSM510 and Zeiss LSM 880 AiryScan confocal
laser-scanning confocal microscopes. For quantitation of SA-βGal and
Aβ plaque load in bright-field images, images of a total area covering
2.3 mm 2 were acquired using a Leica-LMD7000 microscope with a
× 10 objective. For quantitation of Aβ load, Aβ-associated
OHg2, and p21 fluorescent intensities in fluorescence, 0.22 mm 2 frames were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope with a ×40
objective. Analyses were performed using Zeiss software (see Life Sciences
Reporting Summary).

Adult mouse brains were flash frozen and subjected to horizontal
10-μm-thick sections using cryostat and mounted on SuperFrost plus slides
(Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80 °C. Sections were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 15–20 min at 4°C, dehydrated in 50%, 70%,
and 100% ethanol, air-dried at room temperature for 5 min and preincubated in
proteinase IV solution for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescent RNAscope-ISH
was performed using an RNAscope Fresh Frozen Multiplex Fluorescent kit according
to the manufacture’s protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, catalog no.
320293). Two probes recognizing mRNAs that encode mouse-housekeeping proteins
( Polr2a and Ppib mRNAs) were used as the
positive controls, and a probe recognizing the bacterial DapB gene was used as a negative control. A Cdkn2a-Cl (catalog no. 411011-Cl) probe
that recognizes 79% of p16 mRNA was purchased from Advanced
Cell Diagnostics USA. Fluorescent images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 880
AiryScan laser-scanning confocal microscope with ×63 objective. The
Z-stack projections were created using FIJI (ImageJ) software and
three-dimensional reconstructions were created using Imaris 7.5.2 software
(Bitplane Scientific Software).

The procedures for pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy have been
described previously 42 . In
brief, two APP/PS1 mice and two wild-type control mice (7.5 months old) were
perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.16% glutaraldehyde, and 15%
picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Brains were left in the same
fixative solution for 2h at 4°C. The fixative solution was replaced with
2% paraformaldehyde and left overnight at 4°C. After rinsing with PBS,
brains were cut into coronal serial sections (50 μm thick) with a
vibratome (Leica) and incubated in a cryoprotective solution (25% sucrose, 10%
glycerol with 2 μM NaN 3 in PBS) overnight at 4°C. The
sections were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80
°C.

For silver-enhanced immunogold labeling, the sections were rinsed with
PBS, and incubated with 1% sodium borohydride in PBS for 30 min to inactivate
free aldehyde groups. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated with
blocking solution (5% normal goat serum, 3% BSA, and 0.02% saponin in PBS) for
30 min and then with a mixture of rabbit-anti-OHg2 (1:100 dilution) and mouse
anti-Aβ (1:300 dilution) in blocking buffer for 24 h at 4°C. The
sections were then rinsed thoroughly in PBS and incubated with a mixture of
biotinylated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and 1.4-nm
gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Nanoprobes Inc.). After rinsing in PBS and
double-distilled water, sections were incubated in a silver enhancement solution
in the dark for 7 min (HQ silver enhancement kit, Nanoprobes Inc.). Next, the
sections were sequentially processed with a standard ABC HRP kit and DAB
Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories). After washes with PBS, the
sections were post-fixed in 0.5% osmium tetroxide at room temperature for 30
min, and then incubated in 1% uranyl acetate for 2h in the dark. Sections were
dehydrated with ethanol and propylene oxide, and flat embedded in PELCO Eponate
12 Kit. DAB-labeled Aβ plaques were dissected from embedded sections and
remounted on blank plastic blocks, and cut with an ultramicrotome UC7 (Leica
Microsystems Inc.) into thin (~ 70-nm) sections, collected on
formvar-coated grids, counterstained with Reynolds lead citrate, and examined
and photographed using a Tecnai G2 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI
Company) equipped with a digital micrograph 3.4 camera (Gatan Inc.).

Three 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice and three agematched wild-type mice were
employed for LCM analysis using a Zeiss PALM laser capture microdissection
microscope. Flash-frozen brain tissue samples were cut into 10-μm
sections using a cryostat microtome (Leica, CM3050s). Amyloid plaques were
visualized by a rapid Aβ immunocytochemistry method using ImmPRESS HRP
Anti-Rabbit IgG (Peroxidase) Polymer Detection Kit and ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase
(HRP) Substrate kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Vector
Laboratories). The sections were then post-fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min
at 4°C. A Zeiss AxioObserver PALM microbeam with RoboMover cap system was
used for imaging, and dissection and capture of tissue samples as illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
9 . RNAs were extracted from the microdissected tissue samples using
ARCTURUS PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse
transcription followed by conventional PCR or by real-time quantitative (qPCR)
analyses were performed as described previously 43 . The primers used to amplify each
transcript are listed in Supplementary Table 2 .

The mouse ESC line GFP-OHg2 was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and maintained as described 22 . In brief, mESCs were cultured on irradiated, mouse
embryonic fibroblast, feeder layers (GlobalStem) using Dulbecco’s minimum
essential medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Gibco),
2 mM l -glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM
β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA;
Gibco), and 1,000 Uml −1 leukemia inhibitory factor
(Millipore). To induce sphere formation of embryoid bodies and neural stem
cells, mESC colonies were trypsinized into single cells. The suspension cultures
were first maintained for 2–3 days in differentiation medium
(α-MEM supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, 0.1 mM NEAA, and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol; all from Gibco).
Retinoic acid (0.5 μM; Sigma), and purmorphamine (1 μM; Cayman
Chemical) and N2 supplement (Gibco) were added sequentially in the
differentiation medium every 2 days. On day 9, embryoid bodies (EBs) were
disaggregated in TrypLE (Invitrogen) and plated on 0.002%
poly( l -ornithine)/50 μgml −1 laminin
(Sigma)-coated dishes in OPC medium that consisted of 25% conditioned neurobasal
medium from cortical neuron cultures at 5–7 days in vitro (DIV), and 75%
DMEM/F12 medium with N2, B27, purmorphamine (1 μM), platelet-derived
growth factor-AA (10 ngml −1 ; Invitrogen), and fibroblast
growth factor-2 (20ngml −1 ; Millipore).

Synthetic Aβ 1–42 (Bachem) was oligomerized as
described 44 . Briefly,
lyophilized Aβ 1–42 was solubilized in
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HIFP; Sigma) to obtain monomers to a
concentration of 5mM. Aβ 1–42 /HFIP aliquots were dried
in low-protein-binding tubes using a Speedvac and the resulting peptide film was
stored at −80 °C until use. To generate oligomeric Aβ, the
peptide was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide to a concentration of 5mM, sonicated,
and incubated overnight at 4°C. The peptide suspension was diluted in OPC
medium to achieve the desired final concentrations. After 7days, the treated
OPCs were assayed for SA-βGal activity.

Differentiated OPCs were rinsed with PBS, and then exposed to 10 Gy of
ionizing radiation, further incubated in B27/N2 OPC medium for 10 days, and then
treated with senolytic compounds containing 5 μM quercetin in combination
with varying doses of dasatinib (0–1 μM) for 3 days. The apoptotic
responses after senolytic treatments were measured by TUNEL staining using an In
Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Fluorescein; Roche Applied Science) following the
manufacturer’s instructions, and immunoblotting using cleaved caspase-3
and PARP antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).

For detecting SA-βGal activity and cell viability in parallel,
N2a neuroblastoma cells were seeded into six-well plates in the medium
containing two parts DMEM and one part OptiMEM I with MEM NEAA and 5% fetal
clone III. Cells reaching 70% confluence were exposed to ionizing radiation (10
Gy); 5 days later, non-irradiated and irradiated cell controls were incubated
with 5 μM quercetin in combination with varying doses of dasatinib.
Twenty-four hours after treatment with D + Q, irradiated and control cells were
incubated in the fresh medium containing 300 μM chloroquine for 30 min at
37 °C, and sequentially incubated with fresh medium containing 33
μM C 12 FDG, a fluorescent β-galactosidase substrate from
ImaGene Green C 12 FDG lacZ Gene Expression Kit (Molecular Probe,
catalog no. I-2904) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by
trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS, and the cell pellets were
suspended in flow cytometry buffer (2.5%BSA, 0.01%NaN 3 and 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in PBS). SA-βGal + cells were
quantified by FACS and analysis of cell viability was performed in parallel
after staining cells with 1 μgml −1 propidium iodide in
flow cytometry buffer for 10 min. Control N2a cells were used for gating
negative populations, and N2a cells irradiated with 10 Gy and treated with
vehicle or the high dose of D + Q were used for gating positive populations of
C 12 FDG and propidium iodide staining, respectively. Then,
10,000–20,000 cells were analyzed per sample.

APP/PS1 mice were subjected to the Y-maze spontaneous alternation and
Morris water maze tests to evaluate short-term spatial memory 45 . On the days of behavioral
evaluation, home cages were placed in the testing room 30 min before testing to
allow habituation. All behavioral observations were made between 18:00 and
21:00. All equipment was cleaned between each trial. Short-term working memory
was assessed in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation test using an opaque Perspex
Y maze (38 cm long and 7.5 cm wide with 12 cm high walls). Each animal was
placed in turn in arm A of the Y maze and allowed to explore for 5 min, and the
arm entries and walking distance were recorded. Spontaneous alternation was
defined as a successive entry into three different arms, on overlapping triplet
sets. The percentage number of alternations was calculated as the number of
actual alternations divided by the maximum number of alternations (the total
number of arm entries minus 2). All experimental data were analyzed using the
ANY-maze video tracking system (Stoelting Co.). Morris water maze spatial
reference memory was assessed using a 1.2-m diameter, circular, white, opaque
plastic tank that contained water maintained at a temperature of 22 ± 1
°C and made opaque using water-soluble non-toxic white paint. Briefly,
for the acquisition of the 18-cm square hidden platform, the learning test was
conducted for 5 days within 60 s of each trial and 4 times per day. After 24 h
from the last acquisition test, a probe trial test was conducted without a
hidden platform for 60 s to evaluate their memory retention. The mice
performance (number of passing and distance in removed platform area) was
determined using the ANY-maze video tracking system (Stoelting Co.).

Twenty-four hours after the last behavioral testing day, the mouse
brains were dissected under deep anesthesia, and rinsed in cold PBS. One brain
hemisphere was immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h at 4°C
for SA-βGal and Aβ immunohistochemical analysis. The hippocampi,
entorhinal cortex, and cerebellar regions in the other hemisphere were dissected
in cold PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing
proteinase inhibitors. The soluble facture of lysates was collected for
Aβ immunoassay with V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel (4G8) Kit (catalog no.
K1519E) and cytokine immunoassay with Custom Mouse Cytokine kit (catalog no.
K152A0H) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Meso Scale
Diagnostics).

All values are the mean and s.e.m. of the specific nature and number of
replicates noted in the figure legends. The two-tailed Student’s t -test was used for analysis of data from experiments that
involved only two conditions (control and experimental treatment). One-way ANOVA
with Dunnett’s post-hoc test was performed for experiments that involved
more than two conditions. No statistical methods were used to predetermine
sample sizes; however, our sample sizes are similar to those reported in
previous publications 46 , 47 . Data distribution was assumed
to be normal, but this was not formally tested. For experiments with senolytic
treatment, female APP/PS1 transgenic mice (n = 16) were
randomly assigned to either D + Q treatment or vehicle control groups. Two mice
in the vehicle control group were excluded because they exhibited sickness
behaviors, apparently as a result of the oral gavage procedure. Laser capture
RNA data collection and behavioral testing were performed in a blinded manner.
All other data analyses were not performed blind to the conditions of the
experiments. For data shown as box-and-whisker plots in the figures and the supplementary
figures , the box extends from the 25th to the 75th percentiles with
the median shown as a line in the middle, and whiskers indicate the smallest and
largest values. Analyses were performed using commercially available software
(see Life Sciences Reporting Summary).
