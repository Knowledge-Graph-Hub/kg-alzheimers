Antisense oligonucleotide therapy for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2

# Abstract
Adult human neurodegenerative diseases have no disease-modifying treatments. We used spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease 1 , as a model to test RNA-targeted therapies 2 in two SCA2 mouse models. Both models recreate progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a neuronal network including decreased firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and decline in motor function 3 , 4 . We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Here we show that the most promising lead, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein resulting in delayed onset of SCA2 phenotypes. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) to ATXN2-Q127 mice, ASO7 localized to PCs, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below 75% for >10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced cerebellar ataxin-2 protein. ASO7 treatment of symptomatic mice improved motor functioning compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels of several SCA2-related PC proteins including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76, and Fam107b. Most surprisingly, firing frequency of PCs returned to normal even when treatment was initiated >12 weeks after motor phenotype onset in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases.

## ONLINE METHODS
Pcp2-ATXN2 -Q127 (ATXN2-Q127) transgenic mice express the full-length human ATXN2- [CAG] 127 cDNA under the control of the mouse Purkinje cell protein 2 (L7) promoter ( Pcp2 ). ATXN2-Q127 mice in this study had a B6;D2 hybrid background. ATXN2-Q127 mice are described in Hansen et al., 2013 and Dansithong et al., 2015 29 , 30 . BAC-ATXN2-Q72 (BAC-Q72) mice were created using a contiguous 169 kb human ATXN2 gene sequence including 16 kb upstream ATXN2 sequence, the entire ATXN2- [CAG] 72 coding region (with introns) and 3 kb of ATXN2 3’-UTR and downstream sequence. BAC-Q22 are identical to BAC-Q72 but with the normal length CAG repeat. BAC-Q72 and BAC-Q72 mice used in this study had a FVB;B6 hybrid background. Creation of BAC-Q72 and BAC-Q22 mice is described in Dansithong et al., 2015 29 . BAC-Q22 mice were used in some in vivo ASO testing experiments that are not shown. Animals were genotyped by two separate PCR reactions using SCA2A/SCA2B and BM13-F/BM14-R genotyping primers ( Supplementary Table 2 ). All animal work was done under an approved IACUC protocols at the University of Utah and University of California Los Angeles. One week post-surgery animals were recombined into cages of four mice for the duration of the study. To ensure blinding, ASO treated and saline treated mice were housed together and the technician performing behavioral testing was not aware of treatment status. Comments on study rigor including blinding are provided in Supplemental Discussion .

All antisense oligonucleotides were 20 bp in length, included five 2’- O -methoxyethyl (MOE) modified nucleotides at each end of the oligonucleotide, with ten DNA nucleotides in the center, and were phosphorothioate modified in all positions. ASOs were synthesized as previously described 31 . The program Bowtie 32 was used to determine the predicted off-targets for the ATXN2 ASOs in the mouse transcriptome (pre- and m-RNA). This analysis confirmed that the ATXN2 ASOs do not bind any RNA other than ATXN2 with full complementarity. We further verified that none of the lead ASOs had sequences that would target the closely homologous ATXN2L gene.

ASOs were delivered to mice by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Injection were made using a Hamilton 26s gauge needle. For mice in Figs 1 – 4 injections were 6 μl of 35 μg/μl ASO7 diluted in normal saline for a total of 210 μg. Control mice received the same volume of normal saline. For other mice in Extended Data Figures injection volumes varied from 6–10 μl to deliver the indicated ASO concentrations, with ASOs diluted accordingly with normal saline. Injections were made under anesthesia with a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane, using a Stoelting stereotaxic frame. Anesthesia was initiated using 3% isoflurane for 5 min and the isoflurane mixture was lowered to 2% during injections. Stereotaxic bregma coordinates were −0.46 mm anteroposterior, −1.0 mm lateral (right side); −2.5 mm dorsoventral. Needles were removed 4 min after ASO delivery. Mice were maintained on a 39°C isothermal pad while anesthesized and during recovery.

SCA2 patient-derived skin fibroblasts (SCA2-CAG35) were cultured and maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin. All subjects gave written consent and the studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah. ASO transfections were performed by electroporation of,one million cells with 0, 0.35, 1 or 2 μM ASO7 using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen Inc., USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol, followed by plating in 6 well plates.. The cells were harvested at 5 days post-electroporation for analyses.

Protein extracts were prepared by homogenization of mouse cerebella in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 M urea and protease inhibitors; Sigma; cat# P-8340) followed by centrifugation at 4°C for 20 min at 16,100 × g. Only supernatants were used for Western blotting to determine the steady-state levels of proteins using the antibodies listed below. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond P membranes (Amersham Bioscience Inc., USA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 2 hrs at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After washing in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP in 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 2 hrs at room temperature and washed again. Signals were detected by using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore Inc., USA; cat# WBKLSO100) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The intensity of proteins was determined using the ImageJ software analysis system and proteins were quantitated as a ratio to β-Actin.

Excised tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 72 h, then were treated in 75% ethanol for 24 hrs, after which paraffin embedding was performed by automated instrumentation (University of Utah Histology Core). Embedded tissues were sectioned in 4 μm sections on a Leica microtome and mounted on glass slides. Sections were then deparaffinized and rehydrated (2 washes in xylene, 2 washes in 100% ethanol, 2 washes in 95% ethanol, 1 wash in water). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched by treating in 3% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 10 min followed by 2 washes in 1x wash buffer (TA-999-TT Fisher Scientific). Sections were treated with Proteinase K for 10 min (Dako cat#S3020) then washed 2 times. Sections were then treated with Cyto-Q Background Buster (Innovex Biosciences) then washed 2 times. Primary rabbit anti-ASO antibody (Ionis Pharmaceuticals) diluted 1:40,000 in antibody diluent (2% BSA, 5% normal donkey serum, in 1x Wash Buffer) was then incubated in on sections overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed 3 times and incubated in secondary donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) 1:200 in antibody diluent for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 3 washes in wash buffer. Antibody detection was accomplished using DAB Chromagen (DAKO) followed by 2 washes in wash buffer. Sections were counterstainined using hematoxylin (Fisher), washed 2 times in water, dipped in an acid-ethanol decolorizing solution (500 μl HCI to 200 ml of 70% ethanol), and washed in water. Sections were then dehydrated (2 washes in 95% ethanol, 2 washes in 100% ethanol, 2 washes in xylene) and mounded using permamount (Fisher). Peroxidase staining was imaged on an EVOS FL Microscope using 2x, 10x, and 40x objectives.

The following antibodies were used for western blotting: ATXN2 mAb (1: 4000) (BD Biosciences Inc., 611378), 5TF1–1C2 mAb (1:3000) (Millipore Inc., MAB1574), RGS8 rabbit polyclonal Ab (1:5000) (Novus Biologicals, NBP2–20153), PCP-2 antibody (F-3) (1: 3000) (Santa Cruz Inc., sc-137064), β-Actin mAb HRP conjugated (1:10,000) (Sigma Inc., A3854). Anti-PCP4 antibody (1: 5000) (Abcam, ab197377), Homer-3 antibody (E-6) (1: 2000) (Santa Cruz Inc., sc-376155), CEP76 antibody (1: 5000) (Novus biologicals, NBP1–28749), Anti-FAM107B antibody (1: 5000) (Abcam, ab175148). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (1:5000) (Sigma Inc., A2304) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody (1:5000) (Vector laboratories, PI-1000). Anti-ASO antibody (Ionis Pharmaceuticals) and appropriate secondary antibody used for IHC are described in the previous paragraph.

Total RNA was extracted from cerebellar tissues, spinal cord tissues or SCA2-CAG35 patient fibroblasts using the RNeasyMini Kit (Qiagen Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNAse I treated RNAs were used to synthesize cDNAs using the ProtoScript cDNA First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs Inc., USA). Primers for RT-PCR were designed to prevent amplification from genomic DNA (annealing sites in different exons or across intron-exon boundaries). PCR primers sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 2 . Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in Bio-Rad CFX96 (Bio-Rad Inc., USA) with the Power SYBR Green PCRMasterMix (Applied Biosystems Inc, USA). PCR reaction mixtures contained SYBR Green PCRMasterMix and 0.5 pmol primers and PCR amplification was carried out for 45 cycles: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 sec, annealing at 60 °C for 10 sec and extension at 72 °C for 40 sec. The threshold cycle for each sample was chosen from the linear range and converted to a starting quantity by interpolation from a standard curve run on the same plate for each set of primers. Gene expression levels were normalized to the GAPDH or Actin mRNA levels.

Cohorts of mice were bred from randomly selected breeding animals. Cohorts were selected randomly to have a balanced number of males and females. Rotarod groups were controlled for baseline rotarod performance as well as weight (treatment groups within any experiment had the same average rotarod latency to fall and weight before treatments). Rotarod testing was performed on the Rotamex-5 instrument (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH). When performing tests, animals were taken to a separate testing room and habituated there for at least an hour before testing. Animals were tested in the same order, and beginning at the same time each day (1 p.m.). Mice in different treatment groups were housed together and the technician was blinded to treatment status. All rotarod testing in this study was performed by the same technician. Rotarod values per each week of testing were collected over five days. On day 1 mice were handled for 2 minutes per mouse. On day 2 mice were introduced to the rotarod using the following paradigm: 4 RPM for 2 min, then increasing by 1 RPM per every 15 s to 10 RPM for 60 s. Tests on days 3–5 on the accelerating rotarod were identical with three tests per day as follows: Mice were placed on the rod which from 0 RPM accelerated 1 RPM every 9 s until mice fell from the rod. Most mice fell before 40 RPM (6 min); all mice fell before 50 RPM (7.5 min). Values of latency to fall in seconds were recorded. The rotarod was cleaned between individual tests. No animals were disqualified from testing once testing had begun, either during training or testing phases.

The preparation of parasagittal cerebellar slices closely followed our previously published description of the process 33 . Cerebella from BAC-Q72, ATXN2-Q127 and their age-matched WT littermates were removed and quickly immersed in 4 °C extracellular solution bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 (119 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 , 1.3 MgCl 2 and 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4 when gassed with 5% CO 2 / 95% O 2 ). Parasagittal cerebellar slices (285 μm) were sectioned using a vibratome (Leica VT1000). Extracellular recordings were acquired in voltage-clamp mode at near physiological temperature (34.5 ± 1°C) using a dual channel heater controller (Model TC-344B, Warner Instruments) and constantly perfused with carbogen-bubbled extracellular solution at a rate of 3 ml per min. Cells were visualized on an upright microscope (Leica) with a 40x water-immersion lens. Borosilicate glass pipettes with resistances between with 1 to 3 MΩ were filled with extracellular solution and used for recording action potential-associated capacitative current transients. The pipette potential was held at 0 mV and placed close to the Purkinje neuron axon hillock (soma/axon). Data were acquired at 20 kHz using a Multiclamp 700b amplifier, Digidata 1440 with pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) and filtered at 4 kHz. Each Purkinje neuron recording spanned a duration of 2 minutes and a total of 40 to >100 cells were measured from each mouse. A total of 1 to 4 mice per genotype were used and the experimenter was blinded to the mouse genotype. Experiments were analyzed using both Clampfit and Igor Program and further analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Figures were made using Igor. Results are presented as mean ±SEM.

Statistical differences between selected groups evaluated by qPCR were determined by two-tailed Student’s t -tests. Electrophysiological data were also evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests followed by post-hoc tests of significance (Tukey’s multiple comparison test). Statistical comparisons of rotarod data were determined using the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the independent correlation option using Stata 12 (procedures xtset followed by xtgee). The independent correlation option was employed because in the three day rotarod paradigm, regressions for wildtype mice frequently have more positive correlation coefficients than SCA2 mice. Regression analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism.

All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (and its supplementary information files).
