TREM2 function impedes tau seeding in neuritic plaques

# Abstract
Variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been associated with increased risk for sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we show that germline knockout of Trem2 or the TREM2 R47H variant reduce microgliosis around amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and facilitate the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque (NP) tau aggregates. These findings demonstrate a key role for TREM2 and microglia in limiting development of peri-plaque tau pathologies.

## Methods.
APPPS1–21 mice (gift from Mathias Jucker) that co-express human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with a Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) and human mutant presenilin 1 (PS1, L1669) under control of the Thy1 promoter 21 were crossed to either TREM2 +/+ (T2WT) or TREM2 −/− (T2KO) 22 mice to generate APPPS1–21/T2WT (n = 6; 4 female, 2 male) or APPPS1–21/T2KO (n = 7; 4 female, 3 male) mice. 4 APPPS1–21 mice that were mouse T2KO were also crossed to mice that had been engineered using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology to express human TREM2 with either the common variant (T2CV) or R47H AD-risk variant (T2R47H) on a mouse TREM2 KO background 8 to generate APPPS1–21/T2CV (n= 7; 1 female, 6 male) and APPPS1–21/T2R47H (n = 7; 6 female, 1 male) mice. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in He et al. 14 the only other manuscript to date that has used this experimental strategy. One mouse was excluded from the T2WT group due to a failed injection, which was apparent upon IHC analysis and the subject also tested as an outlier by Grubb’s test. All mice were bred on a C57BL6 background and housed in pathogen-free conditions under a normal 12-hour light/dark cycle. All animal protocols were approved by the Animals Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

AD-tau was isolated from a human AD brain, Braak stage V-VI, as previously described. 16 Total protein concentration of the final supernatant was 6.7µg/µL as determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Protein-specific sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to determine the amount of tau, Aβ 40 , Aβ 42 , and alpha-synuclein in the AD-tau preparation, the concentrations of which were found to be 1.2µg/µL, not detectable, 12.4µg/µL, and 0.42µg/µL respectively. AD-tau was diluted to a final concentration of 0.4µg/µL and stored at −80 0 C. Sample underwent one freeze-thaw to be aliquoted for injections. Prior to injection, each aliquot of AD-tau was thawed on ice and sonicated in a water bath sonicator (QSonica, Q700) for 30 seconds at 65% amplitude at 4 0 C.

Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, immobilized in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments), and ascetically injected with 2.5µL of AD-tau in the dentate gyrus (Bregma: −2.5mm; lateral: −2.0mm; depth: −2.2mm) and overlying cortex (Bregma: −2.5mm; lateral: −2.0mm; depth: −1.0mm) using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, syringe: 80265–1702RNR; needle: 7803–07). To examine both seeding and spread of tau pathology, mice were unilaterally injected with a total of 2 µg AD-tau (1µg at each injection site). Mice were allowed to recover on a 37 0 C heating pad and monitored for the first 48-hours post-surgery. All animals underwent the same procedures, therefore no randomization was necessary.

Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200mg/kg), perfused with 3U/mL heparin in cold Dulbecco’s PBS and the brains were carefully extracted. Whole brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days before being transferred to 30% sucrose and stored at 4°C until they were sectioned. Brains were cut coronally into 30μm sections on a freezing sliding microtome (Leica SM1020R) and stored in cryoprotectant solution (0.2M phosphate buffered saline, 15% sucrose, 33% ethylene glycol) at −20°C until use. A small nick was placed with a razor blade on the left hemisphere at the piriform cortex to ensure proper identification of the ipsilateral injected side in subsequent immunostaining experiments.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NP tau was performed with biotinylated AT8 (AT8b) (Thermo Fisher, MN1020B) at a 1:500 dilution. A biotinylated in-house human tau 25–30 specific antibody 23 was used to detect injected human AD-tau at a 1:500 dilution. For IHC, sections were washed 3 times for 5 minutes in tris-buffered saline (TBS), then placed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. After washing, sections were blocked in 3% milk 0.25% TBS-triton-X-100 (TBS-X) for 30 minutes and then placed in primary antibody overnight at 4 0 C. The next day, sections were washed and placed in ABC Elite (Vector Laboratories, PK-4000) for 1 hour, washed again, and developed in DAB (Sigma Aldrich, D4293) supplemented with 0.225% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% nickel chloride. Sections were mounted, allowed to dry overnight, dehydrated in sequential alcohol dilutions followed by xylene and then sealed with Cytoseal (Thermo Fisher, 8310). Immunofluorescence (IF) co-stains were performed for 1) X34, Aβ 42 AT8, and Iba1 or 2) X34, AT8 and BACE1. Fibrillar Aβ was stained by X34 dye (Sigma, SML-1954) and antibodies to AT8, Aβ 42 (Thermo Fisher, 700254, 1:500), Iba1 (Abcam, ab5076, 1:2000), and BACE1 (Abcam, ab108394, 1:500) were used to interrogate peri-plaque pathologies. All stains were performed with free-floating sections on a shaker at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. For IF, sections were washed and then permeabilized in 0.25% triton-X-100 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-X) for 30 minutes. Lipofuscin was quenched with 0.1% Sudan black, washed once in 0.02% PBS-tween-20 and again in PBS. Tissue was then incubated in X34 for 20 minutes, washed 3 times in X34 buffer (40% EtOH in PBS), and washed in PBS 2 times. Sections were then blocked for 30 minutes in 3% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal goat serum, 0.1% PBS-X for 30 minutes, before being placed in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 0 C. The next day, sections were washed, placed in secondary antibodies for 2 hours (Thermo Fisher, 1:500), and then washed again 3 times for 20 minutes. Section were mounted, sealed in ProLong Gold anti-fade (Thermo Fisher, P36930), and stored in the dark at 4 0 C until imaging.

Slides with 8μm thick sections of prefrontal cortex from TREM2 CV and R47H or R62H AD cases were co-stained for X34, Aβ 42 and AT8 using the previously described IF protocol, with the addition of a 10-minute antigen retrieval step in boiling citrate buffer prior to permeabilization in PBS-X. Cases were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Washington University-St. Louis. All TREM2 R47H and TREM2 R62H cases were paired with a TREM2 CV case control that was matched by age, gender, and apolipoprotein E status ( Supplemental Table 1 ).

Stains were quantified from 3–4 sections per a subject for IHC and 2–3 sections for IF. In IF images, on average there were 1–4 plaques for mouse stains and 3–6 plaques for human stains within a given image. Notably, the number of plaques and plaque size was not significantly different between compared groups for all confocal analyses. For IHC stains, slides were scanned using a NanoZoomer digital pathology system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Middlesex, NJ) and images were processed using NDP viewing software (Hamamatsu) and ImageJ software version 2.0.0 (National Institutes of Health). For IF, 2–3 z-stacks per section were acquired on an LSM 880 II Airyscan FAST confocal microscope ( Zeiss) with a 20x objective. Quantification of confocal images for p-tau and Aβ 42 around X34 + plaques was performed on a semi-automated platform using MATLAB and Imaris 9.2 software (Bitplane) to create surfaces of each stain based on a threshold applied to all images, dilate X34 surfaces 15µm, and co-localize various immuno-stained surfaces and dilated X34 surfaces. For quantification of the number of plaque-associated microglia, a threshold was applied across all images to assign spots to each microglial cell body. X34 surfaces were dilated 15µm, and spots were manually counted within the X34 + extended surface. Any spots fully within or partially touching the extended surface were included in the analysis. AT8 stained NFTs were manually counted in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus of seeded mice. All staining experiments were imaged and quantified by a blinded observer. Representative images were further processed using ImageJ, Illustrator and Photoshop CC 2017 (Adobe Systems). R studio was used to generate plots comparing different AT8, Aβ 42 , and microglia cells surrounding X34 + plaques.

The concentration of total soluble and insoluble tau from human AD cases ( Supplementary Table 2 ) was quantified in a tau sandwich ELISA as previously described 19 using Tau-5 as the coating antibody and human-specific biotinylated HT7 for detection. For quantification of total soluble and insoluble p-tau, a 96-well half-area plates were coated with 20μg/mL of an in-house p-S181-tau antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The next day, the plate was blocked in 3% BSA (RPI Corp.) in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C. Next, tau-178–225 (pS181, pS198, pS199, pS202, pT205) standard peptides and samples were diluted in sample buffer (.25% BSA-PBS, 1x protease inhibitor, 3300mM Tris pH 8.0, PBS), loaded onto the plate, and incubated at 4°C overnight. On the third day, 0.3μg/mL of biotinylated AT8 (pS202/pT205) (Thermo Fisher) was applied to the plate for 1.5 hours at 37°C, then Streptavidin-poly-HRP-40 (1:10000) – (Fitzgerald) was applied for 1.5 hours at room temperature. TMB Superslow Substrate solution (Sigma) was added and the plates were read at 650nm on a Biotek plate reader after developing for 30 minutes at room temperature. All samples were run in triplicate and results are reported from the first freeze-thaw and testing of the samples. Sample were run and quantified by a blinded observer.

GraphPad Prism 5.01 was used to perform statistical analyses. All graphs represent the mean of all samples in each group ± SEM. Sample sizes are reported within each figure and are reflective of individual subjects. All data was normally distributed and equal variances were formally tested. Significance was determined by unpaired Student’s t-test unless otherwise stated in figure legends and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
