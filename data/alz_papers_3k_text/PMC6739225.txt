# Title
Genetic predisposition, modifiable risk factor profile and long-term dementia risk in the general population

# Abstract
The exact etiology of dementia is still unclear, but both genetic and lifestyle factors are thought to be key drivers of this complex disease. The recognition of familial patterns of dementia has led to the discovery of genetic factors that play a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, including the apolipoprotein E ( APOE) genotype and a large and still growing number of genetic variants. 1 , 2 Beyond the genetic architecture, several modifiable risk factors have been implicated in the development of dementia. 3 Prevention trials to halt or delay cognitive decline are increasingly recruiting older individuals who are genetically predisposed to dementia. However, it remains unclear whether targeted health and lifestyle interventions can attenuate or even offset this increased genetic risk. Here, we leverage long-term data on both genetic and modifiable factors from 6352 individuals aged 55 years and older within the population-based Rotterdam Study. In this study, we demonstrate that among individuals at low- and intermediate genetic risk, favorable modifiable risk profiles are related to a lower risk of dementia compared to those with an unfavorable profile. In contrast, these protective associations were not found among those at high genetic risk.

## Methods
We used data from participants of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. In 1990, all residents aged 55 and older living in Ommoord, a district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were invited. Of 10215 invited inhabitants, 7983 (78%) agreed to participate in the baseline examination. In 2000, the cohort was extended: all residents who turned 55 or moved into the research area. Of the 4472 invitees, 3011 (67%) agreed to participate. Follow-up examinations take place every 3 to 4 years. 40

Analyses of this study are based on data obtained from the third examination of the original cohort in 1997-1999 (N=4797) and the first examination of the extended cohort in 2000-2001 (N=3011). These two cohorts were similar in design and examinations were identical. After excluding participants who did not complete the interview and research center visit in these rounds (N=873), had dementia or insufficient screening for dementia at baseline (N=170), did not undergo genotyping (N=365), did not provide informed consent to access medical records and hospital discharge letters (N=33), or if there was no follow-up due to logistic reasons (N=15), 6352 participants were included for analysis in this study (study flowchart displayed in Supplementary Fig. 1 . A comparison of baseline characteristics for in- and excluded participants is presented in Supplementary table 13 ).

The Rotterdam Study has medical ethics committee approval per the Population Study Act: Rotterdam Study, executed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

DNA was extracted from blood samples drawn at baseline. APOE genotype was determined using a polymerase chain reaction in the original cohort and was determined with a bi-allelic TaqMan assay (rs7412 and rs429358) in the extended cohort on coded DNA samples. APOE -ε4 carrier status was defined as carrier of one or two ε4 alleles.

The majority of samples (81.1%) were further genotyped with the Illumina 610K and 660K chips and imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panel (version 1.0) with Minimac 3. We included 27 genetic variants that showed genome-wide significant evidence for associations with AD to calculate a weighted polygenic risk score. Supplementary Table 1 provides an overview of the included variants. The polygenic risk score was calculated as the sum of the products of single nucleotide polymorphism dosages of the 27 genetic variants (excluding APOE ) and their respective reported effect estimates. All 27 variants selected for the calculation of the polygenic risk score were well imputed (imputation score R2 > 0.6, median 0.99).

We adapted six health and/or lifestyle factors shown to be important during later life to lower dementia risk, as set out by a recent meta-analysis and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). 11 , 14 Among these are: (1) abstaining from smoking, (2) absence of depression, (3) absence of diabetes, (4) regular physical activity, (5) avoiding social isolation, and (6) adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, which included limited alcohol consumption. Based on these six factors, we computed an overall profile of modifiable risk factors ranging from zero to six, and we subsequently grouped participants into three categories of modifiable risk (unfavorable-: ≤2, intermediate-: 3-4, and favorable profiles: ≥5 protective factors)

During a structured home interview, participants were enquired about their smoking habits. Participants were classified as never, former or current smokers. In addition, participants were screened with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale during the interview. Presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a score of >16 points on scale of 0 to 60. Diabetes was defined as fasting serum glucose levels ≥7.0 mmol/L, non-fasting serum glucose levels ≥11.0 mmol/L (if fasting samples were unavailable), and/or the use of blood glucose-lowering medication. Physical activity levels were assessed using a validated adapted version of Zutphen Physical Activity Questionnaire and expressed in Metabolic Equivalent of Task hours (METhours) per week. The METhours/week are the product of MET-values of specific activities (walking, cycling, domestic work, sports and gardening) with time in hours per week spent in that activity. Categories were calculated based on International Physical Activity Questionnaire and also expressed in METhours/week. We defined being physically active based on a minimum of ≥40 minutes of exercise per week with a MET intensity of ≥4. 33 Social engagement was constructed using three domains based on various questionnaires. We included marital status, living arrangements (living alone, with spouse or with others) and asked if the participant felt lonely during the past week. If a participant lived alone and felt lonely during the past week – we considered them as being less socially engaged. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to measure the dietary pattern of participants. 32 A healthy dietary pattern was ascertained on the basis of adherence to at least half of the following dietary guidelines: consumption of an sufficient amount of fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and dairy products and a limited amount of refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fats, sodium and alcohol, for which further details and cut-off values are described elsewhere. 32

Participants were questioned about parental history of dementia during the interview. During the center visit, blood pressure was assessed at the right upper arm with the participant in sitting position. The mean of two measurements was used in the analyses. Serum total cholesterol-, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were acquired by an automated enzymatic procedure (Boehringer Mannheim System). Glucose levels were measured after overnight fasting (8–14 h). The history of clinical stroke was assessed by both self-report and continuous monitoring of medical records through digitized linkage of files from general practitioners with the study database. All strokes were adjudicated by a panel of study physicians.

Participants were screened for dementia at baseline and subsequent center visits with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Geriatric Mental Schedule organic level. 3 Those with a Mini-Mental State Examination score <26 or Geriatric Mental Schedule score >0 underwent further investigation and informant interview, including the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly. All participants also underwent routine cognitive assessment. In addition, the entire cohort was continuously under surveillance for dementia through electronic linkage of the study database with medical records from general practitioners and the regional institute for outpatient mental health care. Available information on cognitive testing and clinical neuroimaging was used when required for diagnosis of dementia subtype. An event adjudication panel led by a consultant neurologist established the final diagnosis according to standard criteria for dementia (DSM-III-R) and AD (NINCDS–ADRDA). Follow-up until 1 st of January 2016 was virtually complete (95.5% of potential person-years). Within this period, participants were followed until the date of dementia diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or 1 st of January 2016, whichever came first.

We used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association of APOE -risk and the health and lifestyle factors with incident dementia. We verified the proportionality assumption with use of Schoenfeld residuals. We tested for interaction between APOE carrier status and the level of the modifiable risk factor profiles on a multiplicative scale. We subsequently evaluated the hazard ratios (HRs) for participants with a high APOE risk status (ε2ε4, ε3ε4 or ε4ε4 genotypes), and compared those with hazard ratios from those with an intermediate risk (ε3ε3 genotype) or low risk status (ε2ε2 or ε2ε3 genotypes). Similarly, we calculated hazard ratios for participants with a favorable profile (which was defined as the presence of at least five of the six health and/or lifestyle factors) with an intermediate profile (three or four factors) or an unfavorable profile (two or less factors). Models were adjusted for age, sex and level of attained education. In extended models, we additionally adjusted for parental history of dementia and cardiovascular risk factors. Finally, we used a competing risk framework based on the Fine & Gray model to calculate the anticipated 15-year absolute dementia risk for participants within each category of genetic risk and modifiable risk profile separately. Confidence intervals were computed based on 1000 bootstrap samples.

In stratified analyses, we explored whether associations differed among younger and older participants by stratifying on the median age of this study (68.2 years) and additionally on the age of 70 years as this age range is often used as an eligibility criterion to recruit individuals for preventative trials that assess multi-domain lifestyle interventions. 4 – 6 Finally, we stratified on sex.

In sensitivity analyses, we studied the robustness of our findings by varying the definitions and compositions of both modifiable risk factors and genetic risk factors that were used in the main analyses. This is in particular important since some of the included modifiable risk factors, such as depression and social isolation, may have been altered by pre-clinical dementia. Similar to the main analyses, we first explored statistical interaction on a multiplicative scale between the studied genetic component ( APOE or the polygenic score), and the risk factor profile under study. We subsequently repeated the main analyses while categorizing participants on the Ideal Cardiovascular Health metric (favorable, intermediate and unfavorable), instead of the currently employed modifiable risk factors. Similarly, we replaced the current modifiable risk factors by the 10-year predicted absolute risk of fatal cardiovascular disease and subsequently categorized participants into low-to-moderate <5%, high risk 5-10%, and very high risk > 10%, based on the European Coronary Risk Equation (SCORE), that includes age, sex, and several adverse risk factors namely current smoking, level of cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. 15

Regarding genetic risk factors, we repeated the main analyses stratified for an AD polygenic risk score that included 27 genome-wide significant variants (excluding APOE ), comparing participants at high genetic risk (i.e. highest tertile of the polygenic score) with those at intermediate risk (middle tertile), or low risk (lowest tertile).

We compared baseline characteristics across APOE strata using analysis of variance (anova) tests. In the case of frequency distributions or when data were non-normally distributed, we compared variables between groups using non-parametric tests (chi-square, Mann-Whitney or Kruskal Wallis).

Data were handled and analyzed with SPSS Statistics version 24.0.0.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and R, CRAN version 3.5.1, with packages survival, rms and cmprsk. All analyses were performed at the significance level of 0.05 (2-tailed). P values were uncorrected for multiple testing.
