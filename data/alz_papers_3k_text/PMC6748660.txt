Microtubules Gate Tau Condensation to Spatially Regulate Microtubule Functions

# Abstract
Tau is an abundant microtubule-associated protein in neurons. Tau aggregation into insoluble fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 1 , yet the physiological state of tau molecules within cells remains unclear. Using single molecule imaging, we directly observe that the microtubule lattice regulates reversible tau self-association, leading to localized, dynamic condensation of tau molecules on the microtubule surface. Tau condensates form selectively permissible barriers, spatially regulating the activity of microtubule severing enzymes and the movement of molecular motors through their boundaries. We propose that reversible self-association of tau molecules, gated by the microtubule lattice, is an important mechanism of tau’s biological functions, and that oligomerization of tau is a common property shared between the physiological and disease forms of the molecule.

## Methods
Porcine brain tubulin was isolated using the high-molarity PIPES procedure as described and then labeled with biotin-, Dylight-405 NHS-ester, or Alexa647 NHS-ester as described ( http://mitchison.hms.harvard.edu/files/mitchisonlab/files/labeling_tubulin_and_quantifying_labeling_stoichiometry.pdf ). Pig brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and used within ~4 hours after death. Microtubules were prepared by incubation of 100 uM tubulin with 1mM GTP for 10 min. at 37°C, followed by dilution into 20 μM final taxol for an additional 20 min. GMP-CPP MTs were prepared similarly but with 1mM GMP-CPP instead of GTP without taxol. Microtubules were pelleted at 80K rpm over a 25% sucrose cushion in a TLA-100 rotor and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μL BRB80 containing 10 μM taxol. For removal of tubulin C-terminal tails, microtubules were further treated with subtilisin for 1 hour at 37 degrees as described (23) . The reaction was terminated by 1 mM PMSF and pelleted at 80K rpm as before. Concentration of subtilisin used and digestion were assayed by Coomassie staining and recombinant p150 glued binding. For GMP-CPP capped microtubules, 20 μM of Alexa647-labelled and biotin-labelled tubulin was added to 0.5 mM GMPCPP in BRB80 (80 mM potassium PIPES, pH 6.8, 1mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA) at 37°C for half an hour. Then 10 mM GTP was added along with 40 μM Alexa405-labelled tubulin for an additional half an hour. Finally, 20uM Alexa647-labelled and biotin-labeled tubulin was added along with 1 mM GMPCPP for at least half an hour. Capped MTs were kept at 37°C until use. In GMP-CPP capped microtubule experiments, N is defined as the number of preparations of microtubules used to derive images.

All human tau and spastin constructs were cloned into pET28A vector using Gibson assembly. Constructs contain a N-terminal cassette consisting of: a 6x His-tag and tandem Strep-tags connected by a GS-linker. The sequence is as follows: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMWSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSAWSHPQFEKGS. This cassette is then followed by the fluorophore (sfGFP/mScarlet/SNAPf) followed by a precision protease cleavage site. Human spastin cDNA was purchased from Transomics (BC150260). A fully active, truncated spastin (Δ227) was cloned into pET28-strepII-sfGFP. Full-Length human tau was purchased from Addgene (#16316). Amino acid boundaries for tau constructs are as described in Fig. 3A . In short, the projection domain inserts were from E45-T102. The Proline-rich domain encompassed S198-L243, and the MTBD was defined as Q244-E372. The second repeat (exon 10) removed in 3R tau constructs spans K274-G304. The pseudo repeat region consists of T373-V399.

Tau and Spastin were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent). The cells were grown at 36° C until OD 600 of 0.6, then induced with 0.4 mM IPTG overnight at 18 ° C. Cells were resuspended in buffer X and lysed using an Emulsiflex C-3 (Avestin). Proteins were affinity-purified on Strep XT beads (IBA). Tau constructs were further purified by anion exchange on a HiTrap Q HP column in Protein Buffer pH 7.5 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) with a salt gradient from 100 mM to 400 mM. Full-length tau constructs were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 column in Protein Buffer pH 8. All Mini-Tau based constructs were induced for only 4 hours and were purified similarly to all other tau construct. For Mini-Tau constructs and Spastin, we performed cation exchange on a HiTrap SP HP column with the same conditions as other tau constructs. Dynein-Dynactin-Cargo Adaptor complexes were purified from rat brain lysate as described 31 . Briefly, all SNAPf-tagged adapter protein constructs were purified by Strep-tag affinity as above and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 column in 60 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 50 mM K-acetate, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 10 % glycerol. Dynein-Dynactin-adapter complexes were labeled with in a ~4:1 ratio of dye:SNAPf-tagged protein at 2 μM SNAP-TMR, SNAP-Alexa647, or SNAP-Alexa488 dye (NEB) during the isolation procedure and were frozen in small aliquots and stored at −80°C. The protein concentration was assessed using a Nanodrop One (ThermoFisher). Protein concentrations given are for the total amount of fluorophore (monomer) in the assay chamber. All buffers and chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich.

All TIRF microscopy was performed on a custom built through the objective TIRF microscope (Technical Instruments, Burlingame CA) based on a Nikon Ti-E stand, motorized ASI stage, quad-band filter cube (Chroma), Andor laser launch (100 mW 405 nm, 150 mW 488 nm, 100 mW 560 nm, 100 mW 642 nm), EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897), and high-speed filter wheel (Finger Lakes Instruments). All imaging was performed using a 100X 1.45NA objective (Nikon) and the 1.5X tube lens setting on the Ti-E. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. The microscope was controlled with Micro-manager software. For imaging Tau binding at 20 nM ( Fig. 1K ), an 8X neutral density filter was used to reduce total signal intensity.

TIRF chambers were assembled from acid washed coverslips ( http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Salmon/protocolscoverslippreps.html ) and double-sided sticky tape. Taxol-stabilized MTs were assembled with incorporation of ~ 10% Dylight-405- or Alexa647-, and biotin-labeled tubulin. Chambers were first incubated with 0.5 mg/mL PLL-PEG-Biotin (Surface Solutions Inc.) for 10 min., followed by 0.5 mg/mL streptavidin for 5 min. Microtubules were diluted into BC Buffer (80mM Pipes pH 6.8, 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA, 1 mg/mL BSA, 1mg/mL casein, 10μM taxol) then incubated in the chamber and allowed to adhere to the streptavidin-coated surface for 10 minutes. Unbound MTs were washed away with TIRF buffer (60 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 50 mM K-acetate, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 10 % glycerol, 0.5 % Pluronic F-127, 0.1 mg/mL Biotin-BSA, 0.2 mg/mL κ-casein, 10μM taxol). Unless otherwise stated, experiments were conducted in imaging buffer (60 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 50 mM K-acetate, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 10 % glycerol, 0.5 % Pluronic F-127, 0.1 mg/mL Biotin-BSA, 0.2 mg/mL κ-casein, 10μM taxol, 2 mM Trolox, 2 mM protocatechuic acid, ~50 nM protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase, and 2 mM ATP). Unless specifically stated, all tau assays were performed with 0.5 nM tau and incubated for at least 5 minutes before imaging.

The resulting data was analyzed manually in ImageJ (FIJI). For images displayed in figures, background was subtracted in FIJI using the ‘subtract background’ function with a rolling ball radius of 50 and brightness and contrast settings were modified linearly. In images where there was substantial drift, the “Descriptor-based series registration (2D/3D + T)” plug-in was used in FIJI with interactive brightness and size detections in the MT channel to register the images.

Tau condensation assays ( Figa. 1a - c , Supplementary Fig. 1b ) were conducted in Cellvis 96-well Glass Bottom Plate (Cellvis, #P96–1.5H-N). For washout experiments double-sided sticky tape chambers were assembled with 22 × 40 mm coverglass perpendicular to the glass slide. The coverslip was then sealed to the coverglass by epoxy. The extra coverglass area allowed for seamless buffer exchange during imaging. For wash-in, and 1,6-hexanediole experiments, images were taken one second apart until the end of the assay. For wash-out assays, images were taken every 30 seconds. Intensity was measured manually using kymographs on ImageJ. Time zero was defined as the point of visible condensate nucleation. N is defined as the number of chambers imaged in the dataset.

FRAP experiments: Images were acquired on a TIRF microscope built by Nikon using a Nikon Ti2 stand, LU-n4 four laser unit, EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897), and high-speed filter wheel (Finger Lakes Instruments). Stimulation was directed using a miniscanner coupled with a motorized Ti2-LAPP system and powered by a 405nm laser (100mW) using a 405nm Reflect/430–800nm Transmit Mirror for L-APP Dual TIRF. All imaging was performed using a 100X 1.45NA objective (Nikon) and the 1.5X tube lens setting on the Ti2. All experiments were done at 25°C. For the FRAP experiments a pre-bleach image was acquired by averaging 8–10 consecutive images. Then 8 regions were bleached (2 background, 4 condensate, 4 lattice) at 2% power without scanning. 5 images were taken before stimulation and 150 images were taken after stimulation all at 1 second intervals.

Plots were generated using NIS-Elements AR software and exported to excel. The background subtracted average intensity was measured in a region of interest (ROI) overtime and normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity within the first 5 frames. Data from 24 condensate and lattice regions were analyzed and pooled from experiments from two days with two different protein preparations. In figure legends, N is defined as number of chambers used.

Tracks of molecules were assessed for co-localization with condensates by manual inspection. On rare occasions, tracks were found to briefly co-localize with the condensates but were mostly motile outside such regions. These latter tracks were not considered for analysis of diffusion within the condensates. A total of 108 tracks were thus identified and their MSD curves were then calculated and averaged. The diffusion coefficient which was estimated from the averaged curve was computed (<x 2 >=2Dt) found to be 3.94e-4 micron 2 /sec.

Of note, some tau molecules were found to localize outside of MTs. Tracks from such molecules tended to show diffusion coefficient of order 1e-4. This can be taken as an estimate of background drift and vibration of the optical stage and is sufficiently low that it can be hard to computationally correct. Crucially, any such drift is lower than the diffusion within condensates. Therefore 3.94e-4 micron 2 /sec. may be a slight overestimate but not a major departure from the true value.

2N4R SNAPf-Tau was labeled with TMR dye in a 1:4 molar ratio for 2 hours before size exclusion with Zeba Spin Desalting Column (Thermo Scientific #89882). Then, 0.5 nM GFP-Tau was flowed in to first form condensates. Next, a mixture of 0.5 nM GFP-Tau and 10–25 pM TMR-Tau was flowed in the chamber. Images in the TMR channel were taken every 0.25 seconds. Images were taken every second to measure single molecule dwell times. We used the GFP channel as a fiducial for dwell times inside and outside of condensates. Only molecules whose entire residency on the MT lattice was captured, inside or outside condensates, were counted. N is defined as the number of chambers used.

Cultured neurons were obtained from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse embryonic hippocampi. Hippocampi were carefully dissected and meninges removed. Dissociation was achieved by a combination of enzymatic digestion using papain and pipetting homogenization (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Neurons were resuspended in neuron growth media (Neurobasal media containing 2% B27 supplement, 2% GlutaMAX solution, glucose, and penicillin/streptomycin). A total of ~10 5 neurons were plated in poly-D-Lysine-coated coverslips. Growth media was changed every two days. The morning a vaginal plug was observed was considered E0.5. All animals were used with approval from the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. The use of animals complied with all relevant ethical regulations regarding animal research.

At the desired day in vitro (DIV), the neurons were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X for 5 minutes. Neurons were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibody at a 1:500 dilution (Tau – Genetex #49353, or Thermo Scientific #13–6400, Beta-Tubulin – Abcam #ab6046), followed fluorescently-labelled secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Anti-chicken – A11039, Anti-mouse – A28175, A28180, Anti-rabbit - A27039), and mounted with Vectashield.

Coverslips were imaged on a Leica TCS SPE-II RYBV with automated DMi8 with a Leica laser launch (25 mW 405 nm, 10 mW 488 nm, 20 mW 561 nm, 18 mW 635 nm). All imaging was performed using a HC PL APO CS2 63X 1.40NA objective (Leica) Experiments were conducted at room temperature. The microscope was controlled with Leica LAS X software and analyzed with ImageJ. For qualitative images, N is defined as the number of neuronal preparations used.

For quantification of tau puncta, the brightest plane for a given z stack was selected for analysis. The non-neuronal was filtered via its low intensity, although bright spots outside of neuronal area were also occasionally masked out by hand. The loci of tau enhancement in all cases were identified by fitting local intensity to Gaussian or quadratic profile. Good fits were identified via imposing a limit on squared residuals and cutoffs on fitted peak widths in x and y (both to avoid fitting single pixel specs and large broad peaks such as cell bodies). All cutoffs were held the same for all data being analyzed. The density of enhanced tau loci was quantified as the number of loci divided by the number of pixels corresponding to neuronal fluorescence.

mScarlet-tagged 2N4R tau condensates were used as fiducials for condensate boundaries. Background subtracted mean intensities were obtained for a linescan along the microtubule. Each straight and uninterrupted (no MT overlaps) stretch of MT was counted as a single data point. Data points from two different protein preparations of mScarlet-labeled 2N4R tau condensates were pooled. Fold enrichment was calculated by dividing each data point for condensate intensity by the average value of associated lattice intensity.

DDX movement was visualized manually using kymographs. The behaviors at condensates were characterized in the following manner. A loss of signal at a condensate was binned as “detach”. Continuing through the condensate boundary without a change in velocity was binned as “pass”. A “pause” was defined as a diffraction limited stop in processivity for longer than 3 frames (1.5 sec.). These molecules were then binned as pause-pass and pause-detach following the same behaviors as above. “Bidirectional” was binned as molecules that exhibit diffraction limited movement towards a single direction for longer than 1 micron, then reversed direction upon encountering a condensate.

Peak tau intensity for a condensate was derived by first averaging the intensities per pixel over time for a condensate throughout the entire movie. In the event of significant stage drift, the intensities at the time of the events were used. The “Find Peaks” plug-in using default conditions for ImageJ was then used to determine the peak intensity. Background intensity of a non-MT region nearby was then subtracted from this value to determine background subtracted peak intensity.

The FIJI plugin ComDet was used to analyze the intensities of TMR-labeled SNAP-2N4R-tau molecules bound to MTs. The estimated particle size was set to three pixels and the intensity threshold was set to three SD. Photobleaching analysis was carried out on TMR-labeled SNAP-2N4R-tau molecules that were non-specifically bound to the observation chamber to avoid the confounding factors of tau diffusion and dissociation from MTs. Kymographs were generated by drawing a line across these molecules and the intensity of the molecules was then plotted against time. Photobleaching steps were then assessed manually by visual inspection of the intensity plots.

Linear regions of MT lattice inside and outside condensates were identified, and the MT intensity at the end of acquisition (~10 minutes) was normalized to initial MT intensity from the first frame. MT regions that detached from the coverslip during the severing reaction were excluded from analysis.

Pixel intensities were obtained from continuous uninterrupted regions along the MT as in Fig.3 . The pixel intensities were normalized to the average pixel intensity of all regions in the same field of view to normalize for changes in imaging conditions (laser intensity, TIRF angle, etc.). All normalized values were aggregated and graphed on a relative frequency plot.

All data was collected from at least two independent trials with at least three independent experimental chambers per trial. All repeated independent experiments showed similar results. Unless otherwise stated, all data was analyzed manually using ImageJ (FIJI). Graphs were created using Graphpad Prism 7.0a and 8.0.1, and statistical tests were performed using this program. Major points on graphs represent data means with error bars representing variation or associated estimates of uncertainty. For comparison of DDB behaviors at condensates, the data was collected into a contingency table with four assay conditions and five observable outcomes.

For data in Fig. S4B , the aggregate analysis of the observed outcome frequencies for the entire table was performed using the Pearson’s chi-squared test and showed significance at very high levels (p < 0.0001). However, some outcome counts were low (below 5) so the analysis was redone using Fisher’s exact test and again significance was extremely high (p < 0.0001). DDB outcomes were compared pairwise with other assay conditions (using data for all outcomes and for just “Pass”/”Pause Pass” pair of outcomes) and significant differences (p < 0.0001) were seen for all comparisons using both tests. Where appropriate, statistical tests were two-sided.
