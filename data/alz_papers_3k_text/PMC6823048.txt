# Title
Common brain disorders are associated with heritable patterns of apparent aging of the brain

# Abstract
Common risk factors for psychiatric and other brain disorders likely converge on biological pathways influencing the development and maintenance of brain structure and function across life. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 45,615 individuals aged 3 to 96 years, we demonstrate distinct patterns of apparent brain aging in several brain disorders and reveal genetic pleiotropy between apparent brain aging in healthy individuals and common brain disorders.

We have included data collected through collaborations, data sharing platforms, consortia as well as available in-house cohorts. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. We included as much data as we could gather (brain scans from N=45,615 individuals) and sample size of individual clinical groups is thus based on data availability. Suppl. Tables 1 - 3 provide detailed information on the individual cohorts. All included cohorts have been published on, and we refer to a list of publications that can be consulted for a more detailed overview of cohort characteristics. Data collection in each cohort was performed with participants’ written informed consent and with approval by the respective local Institutional Review Boards.

Raw T1 data for all study participants were stored and analysed locally at University of Oslo, following a harmonized analysis protocol applied to each individual subject data ( Suppl. Fig. 1 ). We performed automated surface-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation using Freesurfer 5.3 21 . We deployed an automated quality control protocol executed within each of the contributing cohorts that excluded potential outliers based on the Euler number 22 of the respective Freesurfer segmentations. Euler number captures the topological complexity of the uncorrected Freesurfer surfaces and thus comprises a proxy of data quality 22 . In brief, for each scanning site we regressed age, age 2 and sex from the Euler number of the left and right hemispheres and identified scans that deceeded 3 standard deviations (SD) on either of the residualized Euler numbers. Suppl. Fig. 13 provides a validation of the approach against manual quality control. Data from a total of 977 individuals was excluded in this step, yielding 45,615 subjects for the main analysis. To further minimize confounding effects of data quality 23 , we performed supplementary analyses using a subset of data, where a more stringent threshold was used for exclusion (1 SD on Euler numbers). Thus, supplemental analysis provides a sanity check with those subjects excluded (sample size: n = 40,301).

We utilized a recent multi-modal cortical parcellation scheme 24 to extract cortical thickness, area and volume for 180 regions of interest (ROI) per hemisphere. In addition, we extracted the classic set of cerebellar/subcortical and cortical summary statistics 21 . This yielded a total set of 1118 structural brain imaging features (360/360/360/38 for cortical thickness/area/volume as well as cerebellar/subcortical and cortical summary statistics, respectively).

We used machine learning on this feature set to predict the age of each individual’s brain. First, we split the available data into a training sample and ten independent test samples ( Fig. 1a ). The test samples in total comprised 5788 individuals with brain disorders and 4353 healthy controls. For each of the ten clinical groups, we selected a set of healthy controls from the pool of 4353 individuals, matched for age, sex and scanning site using propensity score matching 25 . Thus, data from some healthy individuals acted as control data in several test samples, yet each test sample had the same number of patients and controls and all subjects in the test samples were independent of the subjects in the training sample. The remaining datasets (45,615 − (5788+4353) = 35,474) went into the training set. For each sex, we trained machine learning models based on gradient tree boosting 26 utilizing the xgboost package in R 27 , chosen due to its resource efficiency and demonstrated superior performance in previous machine learning competitions 26 , to predict the age of the brain using data available in the training set. First, model parameters were tuned using a 5-fold cross-validation of the training data. This step identified the optimal number of model training iterations by assessing the prediction error for 1500 rounds and implementing an early stopping if the performance did not improve for 20 rounds. Based on previous experience, the learning rate was pre-set to eta =0.01 and all other parameters were set to default 27 for linear xgboost tree models. After determining the optimal number of training iterations, the full set of training data was used to train the final models with the adjusted nrounds parameter. These models were used to predict brain age in the test samples, and the brain age gap (deviation between brain and chronological age) was computed. In line with a recent recommendation 28 , all statistical analyses on the brain age gap accounted for age, age 2 , sex, scanning site and Euler number. In addition, to assess overall model performance, prediction models were cross-validated within the training set using a 5-fold cross validation, each fold implementing the above described training procedure and testing on the hold-out part of the training set. Brain age predictions on the level of individual brain regions followed the same procedures as those described for the full brain level, except that the feature set was reduced to cover only those features that overlapped more than 50% with a given lobe. Regions were defined following the Freesurfer lobesStrict segmentation as occipital , frontal , temporal , parietal , cingulate and insula . In addition, given the limited number of cerebellar features available in the Freesurfer summary statistics, cerebellar and subcortical features were grouped into a cerebellar / subcortical region ( Fig. 1b ). For additional validation, we compared our xgboost approach against two other approaches ( Suppl. Fig. 3 ). One approach implemented a different machine learning algorithm on the same set of features (slm from the care package 29 ), whereas the other approach made use of a fully independent processing pipeline, feature set and algorithm ( github.com/james-cole/brainageR 13 , 30 ). Furthermore, we assessed the impact of sample size on model performance by creating random subsets of data with sample sizes of 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 individuals (40 random subsets per sample size). For each subset and sample size we assessed model performance using cross-validation ( Suppl. Fig. 5 ).

The genetic analysis was performed in UK Biobank data, which was part of the training set in the main analysis. We thus trained different brain age models for the genetic analysis. We selected all healthy subjects and estimated their brain age using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, like the one performed when validating performance of the training set. The resulting unbiased estimates of brain age gaps for all UK Biobank individuals with genetic data available went into the genome-wide association analysis, LD score regression and conjunctional FDR.

We performed both mega- (across cohorts) and meta- (within cohort) analyses. To estimate group effects on a given measure in a mega-analysis framework, we computed the effect of diagnosis in relation to the healthy controls for each of the ten test samples in a linear model accounting for age, age 2 , sex, scanning site and Euler number. Cohen’s d effect sizes were estimated based on contrast t-statistics 31 following Formula 1 : (1) d = t ( n 1 + n 2 ) n 1 n 2 d f

For the meta-analysis, similar models were computed within cohorts. In addition to estimating Cohen’s d ( Formula 1 ), we estimated the variance of d following Formula 2 . (2) v = ( n 1 + n 2 n 1 n 2 + d 2 2 ( n 1 + n 2 − 2 ) ) ( n 1 + n 2 n 1 + n 2 − 2 )

Cumulative effects across cohorts were then estimated using a variance-weighted random-effects model as implemented in the metafor package in R 32 .

Data distributions were assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.

In Suppl. Fig 9 , we performed clustering of effect sizes from Figure 2b using heatmap.2 from the gplots package 33 in R. A Spearman correlation matrix was computed based on the case-control effect sizes obtained from each test sample and region and hierarchical clustering was performed using the default settings. To further explore regional specificity, we performed an analysis that involved only the clinical groups. We regressed age, age 2 , sex, scanning site and Euler number from the brain age gaps in each test sample. Next, we joined data from each pair of clinical groups and each pair of regions for repeated measures analysis of variance and estimated the effect sizes of region x group interactions (1260 ANOVAs in total). The significant interaction effects were visualized in Figure 2c using the circlize package 34 in R.

We restricted all genetic analyses to individuals from the UK Biobank with European ancestry, as determined by the UK Biobank study team 35 . We applied standard quality control procedures to the UK Biobank v3 imputed genetic data. In brief, we removed SNPs with an imputation quality score below 0.5, with a minor allele frequency less than .05, missing in more than 5% of individuals, and failing the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium tests at a p<1x10-6, yielding SNP data from 20,170 adult healthy individuals. We performed a genome-wide association analysis using PLINK v1.9 36 , accounting the analysis for 10 genetic principal components, age, age 2 , sex, scanning site and Euler number. We used LD Score regression 37 to estimate narrow sense heritability.

Furthermore, we used cross-trait LD Score regression 37 , 38 to calculate genetic correlations, and conjunctional FDR analyses 39 , 40 to assess genetic overlap between two complex traits. We gathered genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) summary statistics for ASD 41 , ADHD 42 , SZ 43 , BD 44 , MS 45 , MD 46 , and AD 47 ; and assessed genetic overlap with brain age gap genetics. The MHC region was excluded from all analysis. Conjunctional FDR was run for each pair of full brain / regional brain age gap and group, using conjunctional FDR threshold of 0.05. SNPs were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor 48 .

Cognitive and clinical associations were tested in subsets based on data availability and were performed in clinical groups only (excluding controls) as described in the main text. Using linear models accounting for age, age 2 , sex, scanning site and Euler number we associated brain age gaps with scores of the Global Assessment of Functioning scale 49 (GAF), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 50 (PANSS), the Expanded Disability Status Scale 51 (EDSS) and Mini Mental State Examination scores 52 (MMSE). The t-statistics of the linear models were transformed to r, thus the correlation coefficients depicted in Fig 2d essentially reflect a partial correlation between full brain / regional brain age gaps and clinical/cognitive scores, controlling for confounding effects of age, sex, site and image quality.
