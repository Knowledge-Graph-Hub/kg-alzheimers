Crystal structures of a GABAAreceptor chimera reveal new endogenous neurosteroid binding sites

# Abstract
γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA A Rs) are vital for controlling excitability in the brain. This is emphasized by the numerous neuropsychiatric disorders that result following receptor dysfunction. A critical component of most native GABA A Rs is the α subunit. Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact on anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs such as general anaesthetics. To understand the basis for modulating GABA A R function, high-resolution structures are required. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABA A R chimera at 2.8Å resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the α-subunit transmembrane domain. Our findings will enable neurosteroids to be exploited for therapeutic drug design to regulate GABA A Rs in neurological disorders.

## Results
To provide high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structural information for the GABA A R TMD, we developed a new ‘prokaryotic-eukaryotic’ chimera. This involved fusing the ECD of the prokaryotic homolog GLIC from Gloeobacter violaceus 17 , 18 , with the TMD (comprising the α-helices M1-M4 and associated linkers) from the GABA A R α1-subunit ( Fig 1a , Supplementary Fig. 1a ). GLIC was selected for constructing the chimera since it readily crystallises as a homomer 17 , 18 , with principal crystal contacts contributed by the ECD. Moreover, it forms a functional chimera when fused to the TMD of a similar pLGIC, the GlyR 19 . Finally, the kinetic profiles of proton-activated currents for wild-type (WT) GLIC are slow and distinct from that for most GABA A Rs ( Fig. 1b ). This enables the functional and pharmacological characteristics of the chimeric GABA A R α1-subunit TMD to be readily identified.

Previous studies of pLGICs have revealed that the interfacial loops at the base of the ECD, and the extracellular segments of the TMD, are important for transmitting the process of agonist-binding to ion channel opening 1 . In the chimera, loops 2, 7 and 9 at the base of the ECD β-sheets, which are important for transmitting the agonist binding signal 1 , are contributed by GLIC, while the M2-M3 linker of the TMD derives from the GABA A R α1-subunit ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In optimising the chimera for crystallization, the large intracellular M3-M4 domain was replaced with the shorter linker from GLIC, -SQPARAA- ( Fig. 1a , Supplementary Fig. 1a ).

To ensure that the GLIC-GABA A Rα1 chimera was functional, receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assessed using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiology. As predicted for a chimera incorporating the ECD from GLIC and the TMD from the GABA A R α1-subunit, it was activated by protons in a concentration-dependent manner, yet formed a Cl - selective ion channel characteristic of GABA A receptors ( Supplementary Fig. 1b-d ). Accordingly, proton-activated currents were inhibited by the GABA channel blocker picrotoxin ( Fig. 1c,d ). Furthermore, prolonged proton applications evoked desensitizing Cl - currents, similar to response profiles for α1β3 GABA A Rs activated by high GABA concentrations, and therefore distinct from the slower response of WT GLIC channels ( Fig. 1b ). Protons can modulate native GABA A Rs, but this is critically dependent on a histidine residue in the TMD of the β-subunit 20 . This is absent in our chimera and therefore suggests that residues in the ECD determine the sensitivity to protons.

To further validate the chimera as a new model for α1 subunit-containing GABA A Rs we mutated key residues within the TMD that underpin gating transitions that affect receptor desensitization ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ). Consistent with results from α1β2 GABA A Rs 10 , mutating valine 251 at -3’ in M2 (numbered from a conserved arginine at the base of M2 defined as position 0’) to isoleucine (V251I), or by mutating glycine 258 (4’) to valine or alanine (G258V, A), yielded chimeras exhibiting profound desensitization following proton activation ( Fig. 1e ). Thus, the characteristics of the chimera TMD are in accord with those expected of the GABA α1-subunit TMD.

After screening for the expression and purification of various receptor chimeras in Sf9 insect cells, we noted that purification of GLIC-GABA A Rα1 was markedly improved by including the desensitizing G258V mutation ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b ). Significantly, this receptor (GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst ) retained its functionality ( Fig. 1b ) and was thermostable as a pentamer in detergent micelles ( Supplementary Fig. 2c,d ).

We determined the crystal structure of GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst at 2.8Å resolution under low pH, to capture the receptor in an agonist-bound, desensitized conformation ( Supplementary Fig. 3 , Table 1 ). The chimera forms a homo-pentamer with each subunit composed of an ECD, comprising inner and outer layers of β-sheets from GLIC, coupled to four α-helices in the TMD with an integral pore from the α1-subunit ( Fig. 2 ). A continuous solvent accessible pathway (characteristic of all pLGICs) follows a 5-fold symmetry axis through the centre of the ECD and TMD. A positive electrostatic surface potential extending the length of the TMD is conducive to Cl - permeation ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The ECD structure is compact 21 , 22 , with bound acetate ions contributed by the crystallisation solution, consistent with the agonist-bound state for WT GLIC 23 , 24 .

The ECD ( Supplementary note 1 ) is connected to the GABA α1-subunit TMD through extensive interactions between ECD loops 2, 7 and 9 and the M2-M3 linker of the TMD ( Fig. 3 ). Crucially, by adopting a cis conformation, the conserved proline (P120) at the tip of loop 7 23 enables hydrogen (H)-bonding between the backbone-carbonyl of Y119 and residues at the tip of M3. The hydroxyl group of Y281 (equivalent to Y251 in GLIC) in the M2-M3 linker also forms an H-bond with the backbone amino-group of F115 on loop 7. This interaction further stabilizes domain coupling ( Fig 3b ). The conserved nature of these ECD-TMD interactions ensures ion channel gating follows agonist binding. It also highlights the critical role of the highly conserved K278 in the M2-M3 linker 25 ( Fig 3b,c ), which is also conserved in GLIC (K248). Previous studies of α1β2γ2 GABA A Rs reveal a role for this residue in the initiation of channel gating 26 , where it likely stabilises an open state of the GABA A R 27 . Furthermore, disrupting these interactions by mutating in α1-subunits, causes familial epilepsies 28 .

The geometry of the GABA A R α1-subunit pore ( Fig. 4 ) exhibits structural similarities with other pLGICs under non-resting conditions. These include: GLIC at acidic pH in an ‘agonist-bound’ state 17 , 18 ; glutamate-activated Cl - channels (GluCl cryst ) bound to ivermectin 29 ; GABA β3 homomers bound with benzamidine 30 ; and ligand-bound GlyRα1 31 and GlyRα3 32 . The channel lining M2 α-helices reveal an expanded pore at the extracellular portal (at 20’; Fig. 4a,b ) that gradually tapers towards the intracellular exit at -2’, which is characteristic of a desensitized conformation ( Fig. 4b,c ). This structure is distinct from that for GLIC-GlyRα1, which adopts a locally-closed conformation when crystallized at low pH 19 ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In addition to M2, both the M1 and M3 α-helices of the GLIC-GABA A Rα1 chimera also superimposed onto related pLGIC TMD structures. However, the extracellular end of M4 was rotated around a highly conserved proline (P400), compared to M4 in GABA β3 homomers ( Fig 4a ).

At the extracellular end, the expanded pore is stabilized by an intra-subunit salt bridge between R273 (19’ in M2) and D286 (in M3), and by inter-subunit H-bonding between N274 (20’ in M2) and Q228 (in M1, which is also highly conserved across most GABA A R subunits; Fig 3c ). Notably, although two cysteines on M1 (C233) and M3 (C292) are in close proximity, they do not form a disulfide bridge (as proposed from homology modelling studies 33 ). Looking deeper into the pore, the leucine ring at 9’ associated with the activation gate 34 is open (pore radius ~5Å) with side-chains rotated out towards M2 of the adjacent subunit. This is also observed for structures of the GABA receptor β3 homomer, GlyRα1, and GlyRα3 bound to ivermectin ( Fig 4b , Supplementary Fig. 5 ) 30 , 31 , 35 .

Descending further into the pore, two constrictions are evident formed by rings of residues at 2’ (Val) and -2’ (Pro; Fig. 4d,e , Supplementary Fig. 5 ). This region forms the ‘desensitization gate’ recently described for GABA A Rs and GlyRs 10 , and the ion selectivity filter 23 . The pore is narrowest at the -2’ proline (2.1 Å radius) allowing the passage of Cl - lacking a hydration shell (1.8 Å radius), whilst precluding hydrated Cl - (~3.3 Å radius; Fig. 4b-d , Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Analysing the surface potential electrostatics of the channel reveals an electropositive region at the intracellular end ( Fig. 4f , Supplementary Fig. 4 ), which would facilitate anion-selective permeation. This potential likely arises from side-chain dipoles in M2 α-helices 29 . Given that the chimera channel is anion-selective, peaks in electron density maps in the pore can be tentatively assigned to Cl - ions (~6σ in F o -F c maps). This location is in spatial proximity to the anion-binding sites proposed for anion-selective GluCl 29 and GlyRα3 channels 36 . Moreover, a self-stabilized arrangement of water molecules, similar to those in GLIC 23 , is apparent at the level of 6’ Thr ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Interestingly, at the cytosolic face, the chimera TMD exhibits ‘pockets’ of positive electrostatic potential, reminiscent of those in anion-selective GluCl channels 29 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

Previous patch-clamp studies of GLIC at pH < 4.5, revealed that entry into a desensitized state occurs within ~1.5 - 10 s 37 , 38 . Here, introducing G258V near to the physically-constricted desensitization gate between 2’ and -2’ of GLIC-GABA A Rα1 resulted in currents that rapidly declined ( Fig. 1b,e ), suggesting that GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst adopts a desensitized conformation at pH 4.5. Indeed, residues known to affect GABA A R desensitization 10 similarly affected proton-activated responses for the chimera ( Fig. 1e ), and formed steric interactions at the interface between M2 and M3, near the base of the TMD ( Fig. 4e ). Our structure reveals that this putative desensitized state is stabilized by intra-subunit salt bridges between R254 (0’ in M2) and E302 (M3) and D392 (M4) at the base of the helical bundle, and by inter-subunit H-bonding between N307 (M3) and the backbone amino group of N247 (in the M1-M2 loop; Fig. 3d ). This provides structural evidence for a pLGIC in a desensitized state.

A common structural feature of the proton-bound chimera was electron density (~5σ in F o -F c maps) at a cavity between M3 in the principal (p, +) subunit and M1 from the complementary (c, -) subunit ( Supplementary Fig. 6a,b ). This was assigned to cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) used during purification. The site partially overlaps with sites for lipids and ivermectin in GluCl 29 , 39 and for ivermectin in GlyRs 31 , 35 ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Modelling and refinement of CHS indicated that its orientation best fit the electron density when cholesterol was tilted away from the receptor with the hemisuccinate moiety protruding between M3 and M1. This group could H-bond with S269 (15’ in M2), which is a key determinant for allosteric modulation of GABA A Rs by volatile anaesthetics, and of GLIC by ethanol 22 , 40 , 41 ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). This location for CHS is analogous to that proposed for cholesterol at GABA A Rs from homology modelling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations 33 . This suggests that without the bulky hemisuccinate group, cholesterol could penetrate deeper into this interface, forming an H-bond between the hydroxyl group of the cyclohexanol ring and 15’ serine 33 .

GABA A Rs are major targets in the brain for naturally-occurring neurosteroids derived from stress (e.g., tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone (THDOC: Fig. 5a )) or sex (e.g., allopregnanolone) hormones 11 . These molecules potentiate GABA A R function at physiologically-relevant nanomolar concentrations, while at higher (micromolar) concentrations they cause direct receptor activation. Given their high potency at GABA A Rs, the potential for therapeutic application of neurosteroids is particularly appealing 42 . A highly conserved binding site underlying the neurosteroid potentiating action is considered, from homology modelling and mutagenesis, to be located within the α-helices of GABA A R α subunits 14 .

To identify the neurosteroid binding site, we used the GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst chimera, which is sensitive to THDOC, evident from the markedly potentiated proton-activated currents using TEVC and increased thermal stabilisation of the detergent-solubilized receptor ( Fig. 5b,c , Supplementary Fig. 2e ). Moreover, as for native GABA A Rs, THDOC could also directly activate the chimera in the absence of protons. These effects of THDOC are comparable to those observed with native GABA A Rs (α1β3 EC 50 s for potentiation and direct activation: 0.57 ± 0.1 μM; 2.46 ± 0.02 μM (n = 4 and 3 independent experiments) respectively; Fig. 5c ). We observed no sensitivity to 1 – 3 μM THDOC for GABA β3 homomers (EC 10 pentobarbitone-gated current 99.3 ± 2.0 % of control, n = 3) or WT GLIC receptors (EC 20 proton-activated current 93.9 ± 1.7 %, n = 7).

To explore the basis for neurosteroid binding to GABA A Rs, we determined the structure of GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst bound to THDOC at 3.8 Å following co-crystallization. Neurosteroid molecules were bound to each subunit TMD. These were not located within the α1-subunit α-helices, as previously proposed 14 , but unambiguously across the subunit-subunit interface ( Fig. 5d , Supplementary Fig. 7a,b ). The electron density maps allowed confident positioning of the β-face of the neurosteroid backbone and orientation of the critical A-ring hydroxyl group at position C3.

At this new site, the ring core of THDOC binds in a ‘hydrophobic groove’ that runs between juxtaposed subunits, anchored by H-bonding at each end of the molecule. This conforms to a canonical steroid binding site ( Fig. 5e,f , Supplementary Fig. 7 ). The architecture of this site and the strong electron density for bound THDOC confirmed the pivotal binding role previously assigned to Q241 in M1 of the α1 subunit 14 . A single H-bond is formed between Q241 in the complementary (c, -) subunit and the C3α hydroxyl in ring A of THDOC ( Fig. 5e,f ). The importance of Q241 was demonstrated by its mutation (Q241L), which ablated neurosteroid sensitivity ( Fig. 5g ) without affecting the proton sensitivity of the chimera ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The complementary subunit also contributes a tryptophan (W245) to the neurosteroid binding site, which is critical for neurosteroid potentiation at recombinant GABA A Rs 43 . The indole side-chain of W245 is orientated parallel to THDOC rings C and D, presumably interacting via hydrophobic stacking ( Fig. 5e,f ).

As predicted, its mutation (W245L) ablated neurosteroid potentiation ( Fig. 5g ). The orientation of the neurosteroid is supported by serial mutations of Q241 revealing that potentiation is maintained if the substituent is an H-bond acceptor (e.g., Q, N and H) but not if it only engages as an H-bond donor (e.g., W, R and K) 14 . Given that the C20 ketone of THDOC can only act as an H-bond acceptor, this argues for a molecular orientation in the binding site whereby the C3α hydroxyl of THDOC H-bonds to Q241.

Across the subunit interface, THDOC’s ring D ketone forms another H-bond with T305 in M3 of the principal (p, +) subunit ( Fig. 5e,f ), and, consistent with a binding role for this residue, its substitution by tryptophan (T305W) ablated THDOC potentiation ( Fig. 5g ). The corresponding residue in the β-α interface of native β3-containing GABA A Rs is F301. Interestingly, this is photolabelled by a neurosteroid-analogue in GABA β3 homomers, in accord with a binding role 44 . The base of the binding pocket in the principal subunit is formed by the aromatic ring of Y308, a residue highly conserved across GABA A Rs subunits. In the physiological context of binding at the β-α interface of GABA A Rs, it is apparent that the steroid molecule is also physically supported by aromatic residues contributed by both subunits. Whilst there is strong conservation of these aromatic residues across inhibitory pLGICs ( Supplementary Fig. 1e & 7 ), modulation by THDOC is primarily dependent upon H-bonding at the complimentary face to Q241 in M1. This is only provided by the α-subunit containing receptors and not present in β subunits ( Supplementary Fig. 7e ).

We performed MD simulations to corroborate our crystallographic interpretation for the orientation of THDOC in the binding site. Of many potential docking poses, only one consistently mapped onto the crystal structure. In this position Q241 and W245 would coordinate with the A-ring of THDOC, while T305 coordinates the D-ring ( Supplementary Fig. 8a,b & Supplementary Movie 1). The THDOC position remained stable during MD simulation. Notably, the C3α hydroxyl group donated an H-bond to Q241, and the C21 hydroxyl of THDOC was orientated towards the membrane where it could donate an H-bond to the lipid head groups.

Interestingly, the effects of THDOC on receptor structure are subtle. Although such small movements are insufficient to provide extensive insight, it is apparent that the overall structural geometry conforms to that observed for the proton-bound chimera structure in a desensitized state. The THDOC-bound structure thus resembles that of GlyRα1 bound to ivermectin 31 and GlyRα3 bound to the analgesic, AM-3607 36 , which both potentiate the agonist response. Considering the physical contours and binding interactions of the neurosteroid binding site described here, and from previous electrophysiological studies 14 , we would expect this site to accommodate potentiating neurosteroids of distinct stereochemistry exhibiting high efficacy modulation of GABA A Rs 45 , 46 .

GABA A Rs are also modulated by naturally-occurring inhibitory neurosteroids in the brain, exemplified by pregnenolone sulfate (PS; Fig. 6a ). Their binding site on GABA A Rs has remained elusive although the consensus view is that PS binds at a discrete site from that for potentiating neurosteroids 47 . Expressing GLIC-GABA A Rα1 G258V cryst in Xenopus oocytes and using TEVC indicated a PS binding site was present with an apparent affinity comparable to that for native GABA A Rs ( Fig 6b ). To establish its location, we co-crystallized the chimera with PS ( Supplementary note 2 ). Electron density maps for PS-bound crystals (at 3.0 Å) revealed distinctive peaks of density along the bilayer exposed face of M3 and M4 ( Fig. 6c , Supplementary Fig. 8c ). Modelling of PS suggests it aligns perpendicularly to the membrane at this intra-subunit site possibly engaging in van der Waals interactions principally along the outer face of M4. Although we cannot precisely orientate PS at this resolution, MD simulations indicated that the ring A sulfate group points towards the base of the TMD, potentially interacting with K390 (side-chain density for which was missing in diffraction data; Fig. 6c , Supplementary Fig. 8c-e & Supplementary Movie 2). The PS ring structure most likely interacts with several residues including I391, A398 and F399 in pM4.

PS poses from MD simulations were less stable compared to those for THDOC, possibly reflecting the labile nature of this site. From different starting orientations, PS had a tendency to transition rapidly into an alternative pose in its proposed binding site. In this position, the β-surface-protruding methyl groups are oriented towards the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, the sulfate group forms a salt bridge with K390, and the PS ring core interacts with subsequent turns of the M4 α-helix up to L402.

This discrete site and the varied nature of the residues involved, may explain the enigmatic nature of PS modulation, and account for the difficulties in identifying its binding site 47 . In accord with a discrete site, PS inhibition was unaffected by mutating Q241, W245 or T305, which ablated THDOC potentiation ( Fig. 6d , Supplementary Fig. 8f ) 48 . However, mutating charged (K390A) or hydrophobic (I391C, A398C and F399C) pM4 residues in the chimera significantly reduced the inhibition of steady-state currents by PS ( Fig. 6e ). To investigate further, we developed a kinetic model ( Supplementary Methods ) to simulate the effects of PS and the M4 mutations. By assuming PS binds preferentially to the activated/desensitized states of GLIC-GABA A Rα1 47 , the model suggested that the mutations caused small changes (3-4-fold) promoting receptor entry into a desensitized state and increasing entry into agonist bound-blocked states. There was minimal effect on the PS dissociation constant and overall, the mutated residues had more profound effects on PS efficacy than potency, which may partly explain its mechanism of inhibition ( Supplementary Fig. 8g ).

## Discussion
Here we present a new GABA A R chimera that allows the structural and functional examination of the α1-subunit transmembrane domain for one of the brain’s most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors.

Our description of a novel crystal structure for a functional GLIC-GABA A Rα1 chimera has enabled the structural interrogation of the GABA A R α subunit TMD. This domain contains numerous modulator binding sites, including the GABA ion channel. We reveal several important facets. Firstly, a precise structural location for the binding site for the potentiating neurosteroids. The GABA A R subunit interface is evidently critical for modulation by potentiating neurosteroids. Previously, we had proposed that two sites were necessary to explain the direct activation of the receptor by neurosteroids and potentiation of receptor function. However, with the new structure presented here both activation and potentiation apparently proceed from a single interfacial binding site, a feature that is explicable by using a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of receptor operation 49 . Secondly, whereas potentiating neurosteroids discretely bind between subunits near the lipid interface, inhibitory neurosteroids seemingly bind to a discrete intra-subunit TMD site.

Thirdly, we definitively describe the desensitization gate for GABA A Rs, caused by constriction at the base of the ion channel. This structural feature is conserved across anion-permeable pLGICs captured in desensitized-like states (e.g. GABA receptor β3 and GlyRα1 bound to ivermectin). It is also notable in the recent crystal structure of a heteromeric α4β2 nAChR 50 that a similar constriction of the ion channel is evident at the cytosolic portal, consistent with a non-conductive, desensitized state. This, together with the structure presented here, suggests common structural features underpin desensitization in both anion- and cation-permeable pLGICs.

Finally, it is clear that the α-subunit interface in GABA A Rs also forms a binding site for another important class of modulators, the intravenous general anaesthetics (e.g., etomidate), which can photolabel the β + -α - interface at a methionine (M235) in the α1-subunit 51 ( Fig. 7a ). Our crystal structures reveal that the etomidate and neurosteroid binding sites are non-overlapping, such that the same interface can accommodate both molecule types binding simultaneously ( Fig. 7a ). This likely explains why neurosteroids will enhance potentiation by etomidate 52 .

Further interrogation of the chimera structure at the subunit-subunit interface also revealed a lateral aqueous tunnel. This originates from the lipid bilayer and opens into the ion channel at 15’ level. This tunnel is part of a larger inter-subunit cavity lined by residues implicated in anaesthetic binding; it is also partly-occupied by CHS ( Fig. 7b,c , Supplementary Fig. 6d ).

Given the significant role neurosteroids play in anxiety, stress and other neurological disorders 11 , these modular structures provide a new template for exploring how allosteric sites can be used by drugs to modulate GABA A Rs - an area of significant physiological, pathological and future therapeutic relevance for the brain.
