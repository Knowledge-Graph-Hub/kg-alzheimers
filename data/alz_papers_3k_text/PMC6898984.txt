# Title
Resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s in anAPOE3-Christchurch homozygote: a case report

# Abstract
We identified a PSEN1 mutation carrier from the world’s largest autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease kindred who did not develop mild cognitive impairment until her seventies, three decades after the expected age of clinical onset. She had two copies of the APOE3 Christchurch (R136S) mutation, unusually high brain amyloid, and limited tau/tangle and neurodegenerative measurements. Our findings have implications for APOE’s role in the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.

## Methods
Institutional review boards from the University of Antioquia, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts Eye and Ear approved this study. Like all of the research participants, the proband case provided her informed consent. Clinical ratings and neuropsychological tests were performed as noted in Supplementary Table 1 .

All clinical measures were undertaken at the University of Antioquia (Medellín, Colombia) and were conducted in Spanish by physicians and psychologists trained in assessment. Neurocognitive testing included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and a Spanish version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease battery, which have been adapted to this Colombian population 18 . Additional testing consisted of the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale and the Functional Assessment Staging test, which were done before imaging.

Additional studies were conducted after the PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier was discovered to have two copies of the APOE3ch variant. A fasting serum lipid panel was performed to explore the possibility of hyperliproteinemia type III ( Supplementary table 4 ), a condition found in 5–10% of persons homozygous for the relatively AD protective APOE2 allele and in most but not all APOE3ch carriers 19 . Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

Whole-exome capture and sequencing were performed using Illumina chemistry for variant discovery; rare variants with less than 1% frequency in genes previously associated with AD were considered in the search for candidate risk modifiers. Specifically, we identified rare DNA variants (minor allele frequency <1%) within exonic regions and splice-site junctions (5 bp into introns) of genes using bioinformatics tools. We constructed and sequenced whole exome libraries on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer with the use of 151 bp paired-end reads. Library construction was performed using a previously described protocol 20 modified as follows. Genomic DNA input was reduced from 3 μg to 50 ng in 10 μL of solution and enzymatically sheared. Dual-indexed Illumina paired end adapters were replaced with palindromic forked adapters with unique 8 base index sequences embedded within the adapter and added to each end for adapter ligation. We performed in-solution hybrid selection using the Illumina Rapid Capture Exome enrichment kit with 38Mb target territory (29Mb baited). The targeted region included 98.3% of the intervals in the Refseq exome database. Dual-indexed libraries were pooled into groups of up to 96 samples prior to hybridization. The enriched library pools were quantified via PicoGreen after elution from streptavadin beads and then normalized. For cluster amplification and sequencing, the libraries prepared using forked, indexed adapters were quantified using quantitative PCR (KAPA biosystems), normalized to 2 nM using Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system, and pooled with equal volume using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Pools were then denatured in 0.1 N NaOH. Denatured samples were diluted into strip tubes using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster amplification of the templates was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) using the Illumina cBot. Flowcells were sequenced on HiSeq 4000 Sequencing-by-Synthesis Kits, then analyzed using RTA2.7.3

Exome sequencing data was processed and analyzed with the bioinformatics pipeline of the Center’s Clinical Exome Sequencing of the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) Clinical Genomics Laboratory and the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Briefly, we used Edico Genome’s Dragen Genome Pipeline with default parameters to perform sequence alignment and variant calling. We used the open source software samtools and bcftools ( https://samtools.github.io/ ) along with a set of custom scripts to perform coverage determination and initial variant filtering based on ExAC (Exome Aggregation Consortium, http://exac.broadinstitute.org/ ) allele frequencies. Sequence alignment was done against the Human hs37d5 decoy genome. To identify the potential modifier variants, a primary gene list of 15 genes was generated based on two HPO terms: HP:0002511, Alzheimer disease; HP:0003584, Late onset. These genes were AAGAB, ABCC8, AKT2, APOE, APP, BEAN1, GATA1, GCK, HMGA1, HNF1B, HNF4A, LDB3, PAX4, PSEN1 , and PSEN2 . Rare DNA variants (minor allele frequency <1%) within exonic regions and splice-site junctions (5 bp into introns) of these genes were further annotated and analyzed using a commercial tool (Cartagenia v5.0). Sequence alterations were reported according to the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS v2.0) nomenclature guidelines. The subject did not have other mutations in PSEN1 , amyloid precursor protein ( APP ), tau genes or in the chemokine gene cluster suggested to be associated with an older onset age in this kindred 19 . Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and a Genomizer analysis (v 10.1.0) were used to conduct a comprehensive and unbiased ranking of other potential genetic risk modifiers, including those associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s dementia, helping to exclude other potentially protective genetic factors 10 . For processing the WGS data, the same dragen pipeline described above was used. The data was aligned to the GRCh37 decoy genome (hs37d5). Variants that were called at a depth of <10X were filtered out and then were annotated using Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool. The version of VEP using was v93. The filtered and annotated set of variants was then compiled for Genomizer analysis. Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

Reaction mixture for the amplification process was performed in a 50 μL volume that included the following components: 1xPfuUltra II Hostart Master Mix, 1μL of each primer (10 μmol/L)(Forward primer: 5’- A GCCCTTCTCCCCGCCTCCCACTGT-3’ and Reverse primer: 5’- CTCC GCCACCTGCTCCTTCACCTCG-3’), 5% DMSO and 1μL of genomic DNA (100 ng/μL) 21 . PCR cycling was run with initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds, extension at 72°C for 40 seconds, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit from Qiagen and sequenced by MGH CCIB DNA core using the 3730xl sequencer from Applied Biosystems. To avoid errors in sampling the blood sample used for Sanger sequencing was different from the sample used for the WGS analysis. Genotyping of four descendants of the case were confirmed to be heterozygote carriers of the ApoE3ch as expected when one parent is homozygote ( Extended data 2 ). Data is representative of n = 2 independent experiments and further validated independently with whole exome and whole genome sequencing. Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were acquired at Massachusetts General Hospital and analyzed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Banner Alzheimer’s Institute as previously described 2 . Fluorodeoxyglucose PET images were acquired at the University of Antioquia, Colombia, and analyzed as previously described 22 . Imaging data from the case were compared to those from younger PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers who developed MCI at the kindred’s expected age at clinical onset, and from mutation carriers who were cognitively unimpaired.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 3 Tesla Tim Trio (Siemens) and included a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) processed with Freesurfer (FS) to identify grey white and pial surfaces to permit regions of interest (ROI) parcellation as follows: cerebellar grey, hippocampus, and the following Braak Stage related cortices: entorhinal, parahippocampal, inferior temporal, fusiform, posterior cingulate, as described previously 23 – 26 .

18 F-Flortaucipir (FTP) for positron emission tomography (PET) was prepared at MGH with a radiochemical yield of 14±3% and specific activity of 216±60 GBq/μmol at the end of synthesis (60 min), and validated for human use 27 . 18 F-FTP PET was acquired from 80–100 minutes after a 9.0 to 11.0 mCi bolus injection in 4 × 5-minute frames. 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B ( 11 C PiB) PET images were prepared and images acquired as previously described 23 using a Siemens/CTI (Knoxville, TN) ECAT HR+ scanner (3D mode; 63 image planes; 15.2cm axial field of view; 5.6mm transaxial resolution and 2.4mm slice interval. 11 C PiB PET was acquired with a 8.5 to 15 mCi bolus injection followed immediately by a 60-minute dynamic acquisition in 69 frames (12×15 seconds, 57×60 seconds). PET images were reconstructed and attenuation-corrected, and each frame was evaluated to verify adequate count statistics and absence of head motion.

18 F FTP specific binding was expressed in FS ROIs as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) to cerebellum, similar to a previous report 26 , using the FS cerebellar grey ROI as reference. For voxelwise analyses, each subject’s MPRAGE was registered to the template MR in SPM8 (SPM), and the spatially transformed SUVR PET data was smoothed with a 8 mm Gaussian kernel to account for individual anatomic differences 28 . To account for possible 18 F FTP off-target binding in choroid plexus, which may confound hippocampal signal, we used a linear regression to regress the choroid plexus, as previously reported 29 .

11 C PiB PET data were expressed as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) with cerebellar grey as reference tissue; regional time-activity curves were used to compute regional DVRs for each ROI using the Logan graphical method applied to data from 40 to 60 minutes after injection 23 , 30 . 11 C PiB retention was assessed using a large cortical ROI aggregate that included frontal, lateral temporal and retrosplenial cortices (FLR) as described previously 31 , 32 .

18 F-fludeoxyglucose PET was performed on a 64-section PET/computed tomography imaging system (Biograph mCT; Siemens) using intravenous administration of 5 mCi (185 million Bq) of 18 F-fludeoxyglucose after a 30-minute radiotracer uptake period when resting in a darkened room, followed by a 30-minute dynamic emission scan (six 5-minute frames). Images were reconstructed with computed tomographic attenuation correction.

Precuneus to whole-brain cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) ratios were characterized from a bilateral region of interest (ROI) in each participant’s 18 F-fludeoxyglucose PET image using an automated brain mapping algorithm (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8 ). Hippocampal to total intracranial volume ratios were characterized from bilateral ROIs in each participant’s T1-weighted MR image using FreeSurfer ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ). All images were visually inspected to verify ROI characterization. Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

For NfL analysis, plasma was shipped on dry ice to the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Mölndal, Sweden. NfL concentration was measured using an in house Single molecule array (Simoa) assay, as previously described in detail 33 . The measurements were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians who were masked to clinical and genetic data. For a quality control (QC) sample with a concentration 11.7 pg/mL, repeatability was 8.02% and intermediate precision was 20.2%. For a QC sample with a concentration 182 pg/mL, repeatability was 5.74% and intermediate precision was 8.34%.

Recombinant human ApoE3 protein fragments (including the carboxyl-terminus domain plus a histidine tag; MLGQSTEELRVRLASHLRKLRKRLLRDADDLQKRLAVYQAGAREGAERGLSAIRERLGPLVEQGRVRAATVGSLAGQPLQERAQAWGERLRARMEEMGSRTRDRLDEVKEQVAEVRAKLEEQAQQIRLQAEAFQARLKSWFELPVEDMQRQWAGLVEKVQAAVGTSAAPVPSDNHHHHHH) with and without the Christchurch mutation were produced in bacteria, purified (Innovagen), and used to assess the differential effects of these proteins on Aβ 42 aggregation in vitro using Thioflavin T (SensoLyte® ThT β-Amyloid (1–42) Aggregation kit, cat. # AS-72214). 55 μM of Aβ 42 was added to solutions of either 10μM wild type ApoE3 or ApoEch (136Arg→Ser) proteins in a transparent, no-binding 96-well plate. Samples were then mixed with 2 mM Thioflavin T dye and fluorescence was read at Ex/Em = 440/484 nm at intermittent time intervals over 2 hours. The plate was kept at 37°C with 15 seconds shaking between reads.

Full-length ApoE3 proteins with and without the Christchurch mutation were also expressed in Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mammalian cells via transient transfection to confirm the impact of these proteins on Aβ 42 aggregation using a previously published split-luciferase complementation assay 34 and based on the known toxicity of the oligomeric intermediates of Aβ 35 . The latter analysis was conducted using the human APOE3 expression from Addgene (Plasmid #87086 36 ) as the WT or APOE3 with the Christchurch variant introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. Reagents for luciferase assay were purchased from Promega. Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

The heparin binding affinity of human full-length, histidine tagged ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4 protein isoforms 37 produced in bacteria were compared to ApoE3ch using 1 mL heparin columns (BioVision- 6554-1). The columns were acclimatized to room temperature for 1-hour prior use and washed with 5 mL of 20 mM TRIS-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). 1 mL sample containing 50 μg/mL of recombinant ApoE protein in 20 mM TRIS-HCl (pH7.5) was then recycled through the column 5 times. The column was then washed for 5 times using the same buffer. An increasing gradient of NaCl in 20 mM TRIS-HCl (0.025–1 M, 1 mL per each gradient step) was passed through the column and 1 mL fractions were collected and subsequently analyzed using western blotting and ELISA. We conducted n = 3 independent experiments.

We used WB to detect ApoE positive fractions collected from the heparin binding columns. Fractions were diluted in 10 μL RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), 4 μL DTT (1 M, Sigma Aldrich) and 10 μl Laemmli buffer (Boston Bioproducts) to a final volume of 40 μl and denatured 5 min. at 60°C. Samples were separated electrophoretically for 1h at 70 V using 4–20% pre-cast gradient gels (Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™, Bio-Rad) and SDS-Tris-Glycine buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (VWR; 27376–991) for 1 hour at 70 V. Membranes were blocked 1 hour with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), and probed either 1 h room temperature (R.T.) or over-night at 4°C with anti-his tag antibody (rb, 1:5000, Novus biologicals), and 1 hour R.T. with IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit (1:10000, LI-COR Biosciences) antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and visualized on the Image Studio version 2.1 (LI-COR Biosciences). A composite of individual gels was used to generate Figure 2 . All western blotting reported in Figure 2 are representative of two independent experiments.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were carried out using Ni-NTA HisSorb Plates (Qiagen, 35061) to measure ApoE protein isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3, ApoE3ch and ApoE4) eluted from heparin columns. The fractions were diluted (1:4) in reagent diluent (DY008, R&D Systems) in a final volume of 200 μL. The plates were incubated for 2 hours. The plate was washed five times with wash buffer (DY008, R&D Systems) and incubated with Anti-His tag antibody (1:10,000; Novus biologicals; NBP2–61482) overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed five times with wash buffer (DY008) to ensure removal of unbound primary antibody and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit-HRP (1:10000; NA934V ECL) for 45 minutes. The plate was then washed five times to ensure removal of secondary antibody. We used tetramethylbenzidine (100 μL/well; Millipore) to initiate the colorimetric reaction and sulfuric acid (25 μL/well; DY008 R&D Systems) to terminate the reaction after 5 minutes incubation at room temperature and away from light. The absorbance of samples was then read at 450 nm using the Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments. Inc) and data processed and analyzed using Gen5 1.11 software and GraphPad Prism respectively. N = 3 columns per isoform in independent experiments. Representative data is expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

We generated monoclonal antibodies against a peptide including the ApoE3ch mutation: KLH-CTEELRVSLASHLRK-CONH2 as fee-for-service from Innovagen (Sweden). A cysteine residue was added at the N-terminus to facilitate conjugation of the peptides. Cell fusions were obtained from positive clones and cell supernatants tested for activity against the wild type and mutant peptides and full-length proteins using ELISA. Antibodies designed against the peptide were tested for their affinity to ApoE3 and ApoEch mutant recombinant proteins using ELISA. The Ni-NTA HisSorb ELISA Plates (Qiagen) were used using the same protocol as previously described on plates coated with 0.5 μg/mL recombinant protein and with the variation of using Anti-ApoE (ms monoclonal; Innovagen; 1:1,000 to 1:32,000 serial dilutions) and secondary antibody rabbit anti mouse-HRP (Abcam; ab97046, 1:10,000) for 45 minutes.

A monoclonal antibody was identified as capable of detecting both the wild type and Christchurch mutant ApoE3 (1343A). The identify of the 1343A antibody was confirmed by RapidNovor (Canada) as fee-for-service. This antibody was incubated with an ApoE3 wild type recombinant protein (50 μg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl) at a 1:10 ratio and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. A negative control containing the cell culture supernatant media only, and a positive control containing the recombinant protein ApoE3 alone were used. The antibody/ApoE3 recombinant protein solution and controls were eluted through heparin columns as previously described. Fractions were collected and analyzed by ELISA and WB.

PBMCs were isolated from fresh blood in a Ficoll gradient using standard protocols. Concentration and viability of cell samples were measured via hemocytometer using trypan blue (1:2 dilution) exclusion to identify live cells (Thermofisher Scientific, USA). Cell concentration ranged from 7 – 12 × 10 5 cells/mL with 90–95% viability. Sample single cell suspensions were processed using 10× Genomics’ Single Cell 3′ v3 kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions for a targeted recovery of 3,000 cells (10× Genomics, USA). Size distribution and molarity of resulting cDNA libraries were assessed via the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent Technologies, USA). All cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument according to Illumina and 10× Genomics guidelines with 1.4–1.5 pM input and 1% PhiX control library spike-in (Illumina, USA) generating over 40M reads per cell. Sequencing basecall data were de-multiplexed and aligned to the hg19 or GRCh37 human reference and transcripts identified were quantified using the Cell Ranger 3.0 software package with default parameters (10X Genomics, USA).

Raw sequencing data from n = 2 runs was processed using the Cell Ranger software suite v3.0.2 in order to perform demultiplexing, barcode processing, transcript counting and clustering analysis. Specifically, we generated gene-barcode matrices per each case’s sequencing data in MEX format, and, subsequently, we performed an aggregated analysis to produce an aggregated gene-barcode matrix (n = 6 cases) using the same software. The raw and filtered gene-barcode (cell) matrices with count data were used as input for Seurat R-package to conduct down-stream analysis. Clustering was performed using Cell Ranger and viewed using Loupe Cell Browser. Cell Ranger secondary analysis and clustering analyses was done on both per case and aggregate data. The per case estimated number of cells ranged from 2,495 to 3,716 for most cases, except for JA_98 (1,179 cells), the total number from all cases is 16,373 cells. The mean reads per cell ranged from 43,470 to 82,240 ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Secondary analysis was carried out using R with Seurat R package 38 and other R packages. The feature-barcode matrices were loaded into R using Seurat to enable a wide variety of custom analyses. The gene-cell count data was normalized and scaled with SCTransform algorithm in Seurat R package. RunUMAP was used to perform non-linear dimensional reduction with the UMAP algorithm, to cluster the cells. Each cluster cell type was inferred by checking their marker genes expression profile against know gold standard single cell PBMC blood cell type labels in known PBMC dataset. The per case data was merged together as a whole for joint analysis in R. Further information can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.

All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com ) and considering a p value less than 0.05 and a α of 0.05 as statistically significant. We used 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test on n = 2 independent experiments (n = 3 technical replicates; F (2, 16) = 76.05; DF = 2; ****p = 0.00000797 for 55 μM Aβ42 + ApoE3WT vs. 55 μM Aβ42 + ApoE3ch; ****p = 0.0000000042 for 55 μM Aβ42 vs. 55 μM Aβ42 + ApoE3WT; ***p = 0.00022 for 55 μM Aβ42 vs. 55 μM Aβ42 + ApoE3ch) for the statistical analysis of the fibrillation assay ( Extended Data 3a ). We used the 2-tailed unpaired T-test to analyze data obtained by the split-luciferase Assay (n = 2 independent experiments performed with n = 3 technical replicates; t = 2.758, DF = 1; p = 0.0202; Extended Data 3c ). All representative data is presented as mean ± SEM ( Figure 2 and Extended Data 3 ).
