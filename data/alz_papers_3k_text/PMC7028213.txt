# Title
Brain cell type-specific enhancer-promoter interactome maps and
disease risk association

# Abstract
Non-coding genetic variation is a major driver of phenotypic diversity,
but functional interpretation is challenging. To better understand common
genetic variation associated with brain diseases, we defined non-coding
regulatory regions for major cell types of the human brain. Whereas psychiatric
disorders were primarily associated with variants in transcriptional enhancers
and promoters in neurons, sporadic Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) variants were
largely confined to microglia enhancers. Interactome maps connecting
disease-risk variants in cell type-specific enhancers to promoters revealed an
extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer
harboring AD-risk variants ablated BIN1 expression in microglia
but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the genes
likely to be influenced by non-coding variants in AD and suggest the probable
cell types in which they function.
