Discriminating α-synuclein strains in Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy

# Abstract
Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy 1 . Clinically, it is challenging to differentiate Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy, especially at the early stages of disease 2 . Aggregates of α-synuclein in distinct synucleinopathies have been proposed to represent different conformational strains of α-synuclein that can self-propagate and spread from cell to cell 3 – 6 . Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a technique that has previously been used to detect α-synuclein aggregates in samples of cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitivity and specificity 7 , 8 . Here we show that the α-synuclein-PMCA assay can discriminate between samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and samples from patients with multiple system atrophy, with an overall sensitivity of 95.4%. We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and biological methods to analyse the product of α-synuclein-PMCA, and found that the characteristics of the α-synuclein aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid could be used to readily distinguish between Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy. We also found that the properties of aggregates that were amplified from the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of aggregates that were amplified from the brain. These findings suggest that α-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of α-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by α-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of α-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy.

## Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, and the experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

CSF samples were obtained from 94 patients who were clinically diagnosed with PD, 75 patients who were diagnosed with MSA and 56 control individuals (people with other neurological diseases: epilepsy, cervical spondylosis, polyneuropathy, muscular dystrophy, viral myositis, myelopathy and hydrocephalus). Extended Data Table 1 displays a summary of the demographic characteristics of these patients. Most samples were collected at the Mayo Clinic, as indicated below. The clinical diagnoses of probable PD and MSA were made according to internationally standardized criteria, including the UK Brain Bank guidelines 31 . CSF samples were collected in the morning using polypropylene tubes following lumbar puncture at the L4/L5 or L3/L4 interspace with atraumatic needles after overnight fasting. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min at room temperature, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Blood cell (red and white) counts and glucose, protein and haemoglobin concentrations were determined as previously described 7 . The methods of CSF collection were approved by the institutional review boards at the study centres (Mayo Clinic and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston), and all study participants provided written informed consent.

Brain tissue from patients with PD and patients with MSA was obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute. Control brain tissue was supplied by NDRI (National Human Tissue Resource Center). Frozen samples of frontal cortex were homogenized using a tissue grinder in 10% w/v ice-cold PBS (HyClone, SH30256.01) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The experiments with human tissue were performed following the universal precautions for working with human specimens and as directed by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (HSC-MS-14–0608).

The purification and characterization of monomeric α-syn was done as previously described 7 . In brief, the pET-21b plasmid carrying the coding DNA sequence for human α-syn containing a His-tag at the C terminus 32 was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen) Escherichia coli cells at 25 °C using 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside) for 6 h. The bacterial pellets were lysed in 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and 1 mg ml −1 lysozyme, followed by sonication on ice. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a nickel-affinity column (Nickel Sepharose Fast flow, GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted using 250 mM imidazole and α-syn-containing fractions were dialysed overnight at 4 °C against PBS, pH 7.4. To remove any preformed seeds or aggregates, the protein solution was filtered through a 100-kDa cut-off filter (Amicon Ultra, Millipore), separated into small aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). The purity of the protein was evaluated by silver staining.

The α-syn-PMCA (also known as α-syn-RT-QuIC) assay was performed as previously described 7 . In brief, samples of seed-free, monomeric α-syn at a concentration of 1 mg ml −1 in 100 mM PIPES, pH 6.5 and 500 mM NaCl were placed in opaque 96-well plates (Costar, REF 3916) in the presence of 5 μM ThT at a final volume of 200 μl. For each test, we added 40 μl of CSF from patients and controls or 40 μl of brain homogenate (at a final concentration of 0.001%). Positive controls consisted of a well-documented and previously screened healthy CSF sample spiked with preformed α-syn oligomeric seeds. Samples were subjected to cyclic agitation (1 min at 500 rpm followed by 29 min without shaking) at 37 °C. The increase in ThT fluorescence was monitored at an excitation of 435 nm and emission of 485 nm, periodically, using a microplate spectrofluorometer Gemini-EM (Molecular Devices).

For serial rounds of amplification, an aliquot from the amplified material was diluted 100-fold into fresh α-syn monomer substrate and a new α-syn-PMCA assay was performed. This was repeated three consecutive times to obtain aggregates corresponding to the second, third and fourth rounds of amplification. The first round of amplification corresponds to the one initiated with the biological samples (CSF or brain homogenate).

Samples at the end of the PMCA reaction were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were carefully separated from the pellets. The amount of aggregated product was measured in all samples by three different procedures: (1) protein quantity in pellets was measured by silver staining after SDS–PAGE; (2) dot blot analysis of sedimented materials; and (3) BCA measurements of total protein content in the supernatant fraction. For SDS–PAGE, pellets were resuspended in PBS and separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel and protein bands were visualized by silver staining as per the manufacturer’s protocol. For dot blot analysis, 2 μl of resuspended pellets was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and air-dried for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were blocked with 5% w/v non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20 (TBS-T) (20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h. After blocking, the membranes were probed with anti-α-syn antibody (BD Bioscience; 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000). The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and a western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the protein concentration in supernatants was determined using a BCA assay kit as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.

A set of seven thiophene-based ligands (p-FTAA, h-FTAA, HS-68, HS-167, HS-169, HS-194 and HS-199) that have previously been shown to discriminate between different conformational strains composed of various proteins 19 , 21 , 33 was used in this study. These compounds were synthetized and characterized as previously described 19 , 33 – 36 , or as outlined below and in Extended Data Fig. 8 for compound HS-199. The stock solution for each compound was prepared in deionized water or DMSO at 1.5 mM. For our experiments, we diluted these stocks to reach a final concentration of 150 μM. The excitation and emission wavelength range was different depending on the molecule, as previously described 18 , 19 .

A mixture of methyl 5′-bromo-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-carboxylate (140 mg, 0.462 mM), (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid (80 mg, 0.508 mM) ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ), K 2 CO 3 (192 mg, 1.39 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane/methanol (8: 2, 8 ml, degassed) and PEPPS-IPr (2 mol%) was heated to 80 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 4 by addition of 1 M HCl and the residue was extracted with DCM (3 × 20 ml) and washed with water (3 × 20 ml) and brine (30 ml). The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was subjected to column chromatography using CH 2 Cl 2 followed by crystallization from DMF to give a trimer ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ) as a yellow solid (115 mg, 74%).

A few drops of pyridine were added to a cold solution of this trimer (0.05 g, 0.150 mM) and the corresponding 2-methyl-3-alkylbenzothiazolium salt ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ) (46 mg, 150 mM) in an anhydrous mixture of MeOH and THF (8:2). The mixture was refluxed until completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC, eluent: DCM/MeOH 1%). The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to provide a dark red solid, which was crystallized from MeOH. The red crystals were collected by filtration, washed with cold MeOH and dried in vacuum to afford HS-199 as a dark red solid (53 mg, 57%). Extended Data Figure 8 provides a summary of this reaction scheme.

The compound was characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.

Samples containing α-syn aggregates amplified by PMCA were treated with different concentrations of proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heating the sample in NuPAGE LDS buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. The digested products were resolved by 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v non-fat dry milk in PBS–Tween 20 (PBS (Hyclone SH.30258.02, pH 7.2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, the membranes were probed with the following antibodies against α-syn: N-19 (Santa Cruz), which recognizes the N terminus (residues 1–50) of α-syn; anti-α-syn clone 42 (BD Biosciences), which is raised against the middle region (residues 15–123) of the protein; and 211(Santa Cruz),which is reactive against the C-terminal region (residues 121–125) of α-syn. The blots were developed using ECL prime detection western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences).

Solutions containing around 35 μM of α-syn aggregates amplified by α-syn-PMCA were used for these studies. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JASCO J815 spectropolarimeter, with 1-mm path-length cuvette. Circular dichroism data were collected at 0.1-nm resolution and at a scan speed of 200 nm min −1 . The portion of the circular dichroism spectrum between 250 and 350 nm was fitted with a quadratic function and the baseline of the whole spectrum was calculated using the function. Then the calculated baseline was subtracted from the circular dichroism spectrum to obtain the baseline-corrected circular dichroism spectrum.

FTIR experiments were conducted using an FT/IR-4100 spectrometer from JASCO. The product of α-syn-PMCA (5 μl) was placed on the top of a diamond PRO450-S attenuated total reflectance unit (JASCO) adapted to the FT/IR-4100 system. The system parameters included a resolution of 4.0 cm −1 and an accumulation of 80 scans per sample. The data were processed using cosine apodization and Mertz phase correction. The data were also corrected for attenuated total reflectance and carbon dioxide vapour absorption.

The product of α-syn-PMCA (after 2 rounds of amplification from CSF samples from patients with PD or patients with MSA) was sedimented at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 100 mM PIPES, pH 6.5 and 500 mM NaCl, diluted 10-fold in deionized water and loaded onto Formvar/Carbon Copper grids. Samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane, using a gravity-driven plunger apparatus. Materials were imaged at −170 °C using a Polara G2 electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a field-emission gun and a direct-detection device (Gatan K2 Summit). The microscope was operated at 300 kV with a magnification of ×15,500. We used SerialEM 37 to collect tomographic tilt series at a defocus of around 6 μm, with cumulative doses of around 200 e − per Å 2 . For each dataset, 35 image stacks were collected in a range from −51° to +51°, using increments of 3°. Each stack contained about 10 images, which were first aligned using MotionCor2 38 . The tomograms were reconstructed using IMOD software 39 and were further processed by EMAN software 40 .

The helical models were manually built based on individual fibril density. The twist lengths of fibrils vary from one to another. We were not able to perform subtomogram averaging owing to the heterogeneous nature of the fibrils. The single fibril density used for modelling has very limited resolution. Its density in the z -direction is elongated because of a missing wedge issue (no high-angle tilt images). We rely on the helical parameters (diameter and the twist lengths) to build a helical model, which can be directly measured from the centre slice of the tomogram in the x – y plane. Instead of creating a mathematical helical model on the basis of the two parameters, we manually built the helical model by tracing the filament density using Chimera software 41 . Model dots were placed along the densities followed by manual adjustment of the dot positions to make the model shape helix-like under the restriction of cryo-ET density. Although density restriction was applied, the constructed pseudo-helical model does not completely fit into the noisy and distorted fibril density.

RK13 cells (rabbit kidney cell line, ATCC CCL-37) were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS 1× GLUTAmax, 1× MEM and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. For toxicity, 10,000 cells were plated without antibiotic in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Neuronal precursors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were generated and characterized as previously described 28 . These cells were maintained in neural precursor expansion medium (NPEM) as previously described. Approximately 5,000 cells were plated per well in a 96-well plate, pre-coated with Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix-treated dishes (1:100, Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were treated for either 24 h (RK13 cells) or 48 h (neuronal precursors) with different concentration(s) of amplified α-syn fibrils originating from CSF samples from patients with MSA and patients with PD. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay, following the manufacturer’s protocol.

## Extended Data
a – c , Individual α-syn aggregation curves are shown in the presence of CSF samples (40 μl) from all study participants, including healthy controls ( a ; n = 56), patients with MSA ( b ; n = 75) and patients with PD ( c ; n = 94). The α-syn-PMCA assay was started by adding α-syn monomers (1 mg ml −1 ) and ThT (5 μM) to 100 mM PIPES, pH 6.5 containing 500 mM NaCl. The plate was incubated at 37 °C with intermittent shaking for 1 min every 30 min at 500 rpm. The extent of aggregation was monitored using a fluorometer to measure ThT fluorescence, with an excitation of 435 nm and emission of 485 nm. The colours represent the expected aggregation curves for patients with PD (red), patients with MSA (blue) and healthy controls (black), regardless of clinical diagnosis.

For serial propagation of α-syn aggregates, an aliquot of the final product of the first α-syn-PMCA reaction (starting from CSF samples) was diluted 100-fold into a solution containing fresh α-syn monomers (1 mg ml −1 ). A second round of amplification was done in the same buffer (100 mM PIPES, pH 6.5 containing 500 mM NaCl) at 37 °C with intermittent shaking for 1 min every 30 min at 500 rpm. The extent of aggregation was monitored by the increase in ThT fluorescence. The maximum fluorescence value at the plateau of aggregation was recorded and plotted in the graph as the second round of amplification (R2). Similarly, the third and fourth rounds of amplification (R3 and R4) were performed by diluting the product 100-fold on amplification each time into fresh α-syn monomer substrate and repeating the α-syn-PMCA assay. The results shown are from one patient with PD and one patient with MSA. The experiment was carried out in duplicate, each dot represents an individual technical replicate and data are mean ± s.e.m.

Aggregates of α-syn that were obtained after two rounds of α-syn-PMCA amplification (starting from CSF samples from patients with MSA ( n = 43) and patients with PD ( n = 43)) were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min. a , The resultant pellets were separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel, and protein bands were visualized by silver staining as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated on the left of the gel. b , Resuspended pellets (2 μl) were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and air-dried for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% w/v non-fat dry milk at room temperature for 2 h, membranes were probed with an anti-α-syn antibody (BD Bioscience, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000). The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and a western blotting detection kit. The dot blot shows each of the 86 samples ( n = 43, PD; n = 43, MSA) and a positive control using non-aggregated α-syn monomer (dotted box). The results are representative of two independent experiments with similar results. c , Protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by a BCA assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Each dot represents an individual sample ( n = 43, PD; n = 43, MSA) in each disease group and data are mean ± s.e.m.

This is the same experiment as Fig. 2a – c , showing proteinase K digestion profiles of other representative samples from patients with PD ( n = 3) and patients with MSA ( n = 3). The amplified product from the second round of α-syn-PMCA in samples of CSF from patients with MSA or patients with PD was incubated either without (−) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of proteinase K (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg ml −1 ) at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel and immunoblotted with the same antibodies as in Fig. 2 (SC N-19 (top), BD anti-α-syn clone 42 (middle) and SC 211 (bottom)). Each blot represents an individual sample. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated on the left of the blot.

This is the same experiment as Fig. 2d , showing proteinase K digestion profiles of all 86 ( n = 43, PD; n = 43, MSA) biologically independent samples analysed. Aliquots of the product of the second round of the α-syn-PMCA assay were treated with proteinase K (1 mg ml −1 ) at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel and immunoblotted with the BD anti-α-syn clone 42 antibody. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated on the left of the blot. The third blot on the top row is the same as that shown in Fig. 2d .

This is the same experiment as Fig. 2e , showing the results obtained with samples from different patients with PD ( n = 3) and patients with MSA ( n = 3). The first round corresponds to direct amplification from the CSF of the patients. For the second round of amplification, aggregates produced in the first round were diluted 100-fold into fresh α-syn monomer substrate and a new round of α-syn-PMCA was performed. The assay was then repeated for the third and fourth rounds using amplified α-syn aggregates (1%) from the previous round. Amplified aggregates were treated with proteinase K (1 mg ml −1 ) for 1 h and proteins were separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel and immunoblotted with the BD anti-α-syn clone 42 antibody. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated on the left of the blot.
