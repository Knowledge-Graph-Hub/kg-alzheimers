Genome-wide changes in lncRNA, splicing, and regional gene expression patterns in autism

# Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves substantial genetic contributions. These contributions are profoundly heterogeneous but may converge on common pathways that are not yet well understood 1 – 3 . Here, through post-mortem genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the largest cohort of samples analysed so far, to our knowledge 4 – 7 , we interrogate the noncoding transcriptome, alternative splicing, and upstream molecular regulators to broaden our understanding of molecular convergence in ASD. Our analysis reveals ASD-associated dysregulation of primate-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), downregulation of the alternative splicing of activity-dependent neuron-specific exons, and attenuation of normal differences in gene expression between the frontal and temporal lobes. Our data suggest that SOX5, a transcription factor involved in neuron fate specification, contributes to this reduction in regional differences. We further demonstrate that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, chromosome 15q11.2–13.1 duplication syndrome (dup15q), shares the core transcriptomic signature observed in idiopathic ASD. Co-expression network analysis reveals that individuals with ASD show age-related changes in the trajectory of microglial and synaptic function over the first two decades, and suggests that genetic risk for ASD may influence changes in regional cortical gene expression. Our findings illustrate how diverse genetic perturbations can lead to phenotypic convergence at multiple biological levels in a complex neuropsychiatric disorder.

## METHODS
Human brain tissue for ASD and control individuals was acquired from the Autism Tissue Program (ATP) brain bank at the Harvard Brain and Tissue Bank (which has since been incorporated into the Autism BrainNet) and the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, a Brain and Tissue Repository of the NIH NeuroBioBank. Sample acquisition protocols were followed for each brain bank, and samples were de-identified before acquisition. Brain sample and donor metadata are available in Supplementary Table 1 and further information about samples can be found in the Supplementary Information . No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The sample dissections, RNA extractions, and RNA sequencing experiments were randomized ( Supplementary Information ). The investigators were blinded to diagnosis until the analysis but unblinded during the analysis.

A detailed protocol, including parameters given to programs for each step, is provided in the Supplementary Information . Briefly, starting with total RNA, rRNA was depleted (RiboZero Gold, Illumina) and libraries were prepared using the TruSeq v2 kit (Illumina) to construct unstranded libraries with a mean fragment size of 150 bp. Libraries underwent 50-bp paired end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 machine. Paired end reads were mapped to hg19 using Gencode v18 annotations 31 via Tophat2 (ref. 32 ). Gene expression levels were quantified using union exon models with HTSeq 33 . This approach counts only reads on exons or reads spanning exon–exon junctions, and is globally similar to including reads on the introns (whole gene model) or computing probabilistic estimates of expression levels ( Extended Data Fig. 1e – g ).

DGE analysis was performed with expression levels normalized for gene length, library size, and G+C content (referred to as ‘normalized FPKM’). Cortex samples (frontal and temporal) were analysed separately from cerebellum samples. An LME model framework was used to assess differential expression in log 2 [normalized FPKM] values for each gene for cortical regions because multiple brain regions were available from the same individuals. The individual donor identifier was treated as a random effect, and age, sex, brain region and diagnoses were treated as fixed effects. In the cerebellum DGE analysis, a linear model was used and brain region was not included as a covariate, because only one brain region was available in each individual and a handful of technical replicates could be removed for DGE analysis. We also used technical covariates accounting for RNA quality and batch effects as fixed effects in this model ( Supplementary Information ). Significant results are reported at Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.05 (ref. 34 ), and full results are available in Supplementary Table 2 .

Throughout the study, we assessed replication between datasets by evaluating the concordance between independent sample sets by comparing the squared correlation ( R 2 ) of fold changes of genes in each sample set at a defined statistical cut-off. We set the statistical cut-off in one sample set (the y axis in the scatterplots) and computed the R 2 with fold changes in these genes in the comparator sample set (the x axis in the scatterplots). For details of the regularized regression analyses and cortical patterning analyses, see Supplementary Information .

Alternative splicing was quantified using the per cent spliced in (PSI) metric using Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS, v3.08) 35 . For each event, MATS reports counts supporting the inclusion ( I ) or splicing ( S ) of an event. To reduce spurious events due to low counts, we required at least 80% of samples to have I + S ≥ 10. For these events, the PSI is calculated as PSI = I /( I + S ) ( Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Statistical analysis for differential alternative splicing was performed using the linear mixed effects model as described above for DGE; significant results are reported at Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.5 (ref. 34 ). Full differential alternative splicing results are available in Supplementary Table 3 .

In order to ensure that our RNA-seq data were high quality and our DGE models were accurate, we evaluated gene expression changes in a representative subset of four ASD and four control samples ( Extended Data Fig. 2b ). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Invitrogen Superscript IV reverse-transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on a Lightcycler 480 thermocycler in 10 μl volume containing SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) and gene-specific primers at a concentration of 0.5 mM each. The results shown in Extended Data Fig. 2c represent at least two independent cDNA synthesis experiments for each gene. GAPDH levels were used as an internal control.

For differential alternative splicing analysis, we validated selected events with semiquantitative RT–PCR using the same samples used for DGE validation. Total RNA (600 ng) was reverse-transcribed using Invitrogen Superscript IV reverse transcriptase and gene/exon-specific primers. cDNA (50 ng) was amplified by 25 cycles using PCR. PCR products were resolved on 3% high-resolution Metaphor agarose gels (Lonza) and counterstained with SYBR Gold for visualization ( Extended Data Fig. 5a , Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Gels were quantified using ImageJ (NIH).

Notably, this sample size is underpowered to evaluate significant changes in many genes or splicing events; however, the goal was to validate the accuracy of our data and analyses across genes, so we show the correlation of fold changes between ASD and control across genes or events. Genes and events were selected on the basis of being top hits or of particular biological interest. Sample details and primers are reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 .

For dup15q samples, the type of duplication and copy number in the breakpoint 2–3 region were available from previous work 36 . To expand this to the regions between each of the recurrent breakpoint in these samples, eight out of nine dup15q brains were genotyped (one was not genotyped owing to limited tissue availability). The number of copies between each of the breakpoints is reported in Extended Data Fig. 7a . DGE and differential alternative splicing analysis for this set was performed with independent control samples from the main analysis, though the results were similar to those obtained using the larger set of controls used in the main analysis ( Extended Data Fig. 7d , e ).

The R package weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct co-expression networks using normalized data after adjustment to remove variability from technical covariates 37 , 38 ( Supplementary Information ). We used the biweight midcorrelation to assess correlations between log 2 [adjusted FPKM] and parameters for network analysis are described in Supplementary Information . Notably, we used a modified version of WGCNA that involves bootstrapping the underlying dataset 100 times and constructing 100 networks. The consensus of these networks (median edge strength across all bootstrapped networks) was then used as the final network 39 , ensuring that a subset of samples does not drive the network structure.

For module-trait analyses, the first principal component of each module (the module eigengene 37 ) was related to ASD diagnosis, age, sex, and brain region with an LME model as above. These associations were also supported by enrichment analyses with ASD DGE genes in Extended Data Fig. 9a . Given that modules are relatively uncorrelated to each other, significant eigengene-trait results are reported at Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05.

Module temporal trajectories were computed with the LOESS function in R. For both ASD and control samples, the function was used to create quartic splines on module eigengenes (degree = 2, span = 2/3). The trend difference statistic was taken as the largest difference between these fitted curves between the ages of 5 and 25 years. P values were computed using 5,000 permutations. Specifically, ASD and control labels were randomly permuted 5,000 times and splines were fit to the permuted groups; therefore, significant P values reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between age trends and disease status. Detailed statistics for module membership are available in Supplementary Table 2 and additional characterization of modules is available in Supplementary Table 4 .

Gene set enrichment analyses were performed with a two-sided Fisher’s exact test (cell type and splicing factor enrichments) or with logistic regression ( Extended Data Fig. 9a , Supplementary Information ). Results were corrected for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini–Hochberg method 34 when a large number of comparisons were performed.

GO term enrichment analysis was performed using GO Elite 40 with 10,000 permutations, and results are presented as enrichment Z scores. We present only the top molecular function and biological process terms for display purposes. Notably, for splicing analysis, we evaluated GO term enrichment by using the genes containing differential splicing alterations to identify functional enrichment. It is possible that longer genes, which contain more exons, also contain more detected splicing events. This could bias pathway and cell type enrichment to more neuronal and synaptic genes, which are, on average, longer than other genes in the genome. However, the correlation between the number of detected events in genes and gene length is minimal ( R 2 = 0.004), and the correlation is even smaller for events at P < 0.01 ( R 2 = 0.00012) demonstrating that longer genes are not more likely to contain differential splicing events.

Common variant enrichment was evaluated by analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal with stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to partition disease heritability within functional categories represented by gene co-expression modules 41 . This method uses GWAS summary statistics and LD explicitly modelled from an ancestry-matched 1,000 genomes reference panel to calculate the proportion of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability that can be attributed to SNPs within explicitly defined functional categories. To improve accuracy, these categories were added to a ‘full baseline model’ that includes 53 functional categories capturing a broad set of genomic annotations, as previously described 42 . Enrichment is calculated as the proportion of SNP heritability accounted for by each module divided by the proportion of total SNPs within the module. Significance is assessed using a block jack-knife procedure 42 , which accounts for module size and gene length, followed by FDR correction of P values.

a , We applied a classification method robust to overfitting (elastic net model 47 ) by training on the RNA-seq data from samples previously analysed in ref. 8 ( Extended Data Fig. 1h , similar to the comparison in Extended Data Fig. 1i ) and classifying ASD versus control status in independent samples.

Compare to Extended Data Fig. 1b and see Supplementary Information for additional discussion. Compared to this study, samples from ref. 4 were prepared by poly(A) selection RNA-seq, exhibit lower RNA integrity number (RIN, median 4.8 versus 7.3), have lower median sequencing depth (11 million versus 40 million), exhibit greater 5′−3′ bias, and have generally greater variability across all QC metrics. j , Comparison of fold-changes for the top significant genes from ref. 4 ( P < 0.01 as provided in their Supplementary Information ) with the fold changes for the same genes in this study.
