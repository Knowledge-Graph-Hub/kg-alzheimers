# Title
Human CNS barrier-forming organoids with cerebrospinal fluid production

# Abstract
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a vital liquid, providing nutrients, signalling molecules, and clearing out toxic byproducts from the brain. The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus (ChP), a protective epithelial barrier that also prevents free entry from the blood. Here, we establish human ChP organoids with a selective barrier and CSF-like fluid secretion in self-contained compartments. We show that this in vitro barrier exhibits the same selectivity to small molecules as in vivo , and that ChP-CSF organoids can predict CNS permeability of novel compounds. The transcriptomic and proteomic signature of ChP-CSF organoids reveal a high degree of similarity to in vivo . Finally, the intersection of single cell transcriptomics and proteomic analysis uncovers key human CSF components produced by previously unidentified specialized epithelial subtypes.

## Generation of ChP organoids from human PSCs
Cerebral organoids are characterized by self-organisation of complex tissue architectures similar to the developing mammalian brain ( 8 – 10 ). Recent protocols describe predominantly forebrain, telencephalic identities ( 13 , 14 ) which also includes ChP epithelium ( Fig. S1A ) ( 9 , 13 ). In order to develop an in vitro model of human ChP with accurate architecture and function, we established a protocol based upon the cerebral organoid method. In vitro derivation of ChP cells using the dorsalising factor Bmp4, critical for the development of ChP epithelial cells both alone ( 15 ) and in combination with the Wnt-activator molecule CHIR ( 11 ) has been reported before. To promote ChP fate in cerebral organoids, Bmp4 and CHIR were given as a pulse ( Fig. 1A , Fig. S1B ). At day 14, undirected telencephalic organoids developed large, rounded neuroepithelial lobes whereas Bmp4/CHIR treated organoids generated elongated neuroepithelial tissues ( Fig. S1C ), consistent with the progressive elongation of the ChP from the neuroepithelium of the dorsal midline in vivo ( 1 , 16 , 17 ). ChP organoids appeared almost entirely enriched in cuboidal epithelium, in contrast to forebrain organoids ( Fig. 1B, 1C ). A striking feature of ChP organoids was the later development of fluid-filled compartments or ‘cysts’ containing a colorless liquid, rarely present in untreated organoids ( Fig. 1B , Fig. S1D ). Comparison of histological sections of ChP organoids with human and mouse embryonic ChP showed a resemblance in complexity and organization between the human and the organoid samples ( Fig. 1D ).

In vivo , ChP epithelium starts as a pseudostratified epithelium, followed by an intermediate columnar stage, and maturing into a highly folded cuboidal epithelium ( 1 , 17 , 18 ). ChP organoids similarly developed a pseudostratified neuroepithelium with TTR positive areas by day 28 ( Fig. S1E ). By approximately day 40, ChP organoids displayed more columnar and cuboidal epithelia, increasingly enriched in TTR and the cell-cell junction marker ZO1, with only sparse neuroepithelial SOX2-positive cells ( Fig. 1E , Fig. S1E ). Cells surrounding fluid-filled compartments also stained positive for TTR and displayed polarized apical staining for AQP1 ( Fig. S1F, Fig. S1G ). Quantification of TTR-positive regions showed enrichment in ChP organoids ( Fig. 1F ). We detect high levels of CLIC6, a highly specific marker of the ChP ( 19 ) ( Fig. 1G , Fig. 1H ), as well as a number of other ChP related proteins (PLEC, APOE, PLTP, IGFBP7, CA2) with lower levels of the telencephalic marker Foxg1 and other neuronal markers (DCX, GAP43) ( Fig. 1H , Fig. S3A ). Cortical Tbr2 intermediate progenitors and HuC/D neurons were also largely reduced in early ChP organoids and almost completely absent in mature ChP organoids compared to controls ( Fig. S3B ). Together, these data demonstrate a reliable and reproducible generation of ChP tissue in vitro , as well as fluid-filled compartments, from different lines of human pluripotent stem cells and with two different seeding methods ( Fig. 1F , Fig. S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D, S2E, S2F ).

## ChP organoids develop epithelial and stromal components and recapitulate the humanin vivotranscriptomic signature
To further investigate the identity of ChP organoids, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), sampling two organoids from three separate batches of ChP organoids and two telencephalic organoids as control ( Fig. 1I-J ). Combined analysis revealed that cells from different ChP organoids/batches were intermingled and largely separate from those of telencephalic organoids ( Fig. 1I ), suggesting reproducibility across batches. Furthermore, although telencephalic organoid cells expressed neuronal markers, such as DCX, ChP cells expressed ChP markers, such CLIC6 and HTR2C ( 20 ) ( Fig. 1J ).

Cluster analysis revealed five major cell types: two major telencephalic clusters consisting of neural progenitors and neurons, and three major ChP clusters. Further examination of marker genes revealed an immature ChP cluster expressing early regulatory factors involved in ChP development including MSX1, OTX2, and R-spondin 3 (RSPO3). This cluster also expressed the progenitor marker PAX6, which was also expressed in the neural progenitor cluster of telencephalic organoids ( Fig. 2A-B ) owing to their common developmental origin. The third cluster of the ChP organoids expressed numerous mesenchymal markers including the extracellular matrix component COL1A1 ( Fig. 2A ), DCN, LUM, and DLK1 ( Fig. 2B ). These markers allowed us to assign three major identities to ChP organoids: immature ChP/hem, mature ChP epithelium, and ChP stroma ( Fig. 2C ). Further analysis also revealed a consistent and progressive enrichment over time in the mature ChP cluster ( Fig. 2D-E ). Immunostaining highlighted both stromal and epithelial cells ( Fig. 2F , Fig. S3C ), and examination of regional ChP markers ( 4 , 20 ) revealed the ChP organoids to be of lateral ventricle identity rather than third or fourth ventricle ( Fig. 2G ) consistent with their telencephalic origin.

Comparison with a published scRNA-seq dataset of developing human brain ( 21 ) revealed a high correlation between organoid and in vivo ChP clusters, and between organoid and in vivo stromal clusters ( Fig. 2H , Fig. 2I ). Further comparison to both human in vivo ChP and developing mouse ChP from scRNA-seq of mouse embryos ( 22 ) revealed higher correlation with human ChP than with mouse ( Fig. 2J , Fig. S3D ). Overall, these data demonstrate that in vitro derived ChP organoids closely recapitulate the cell composition and transcriptomic signature of the human ChP in vivo .

## ChP organoids form a tight barrier and recapitulatein vivoCNS permeability to small molecules
To test the functional role of ChP organoids in the formation of a selective barrier, we first assessed expression of tight junction markers such as claudins and occludin (OCLN). scRNA-seq revealed the presence of several of the claudins (CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN5) ( Fig. 3A ) as well as other tight junction components OCLN, ZO1 (TJP1), ZO2 (TJP2), and PDZ proteins PATJ (INADL) and MPDZ ( Fig. 3B ). We observed apical localization of CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN4 and CLDN5 in the ChP epithelium ( Fig. 3C ). Low levels of CLDN2 were also observed in ChP organoid epithelium ( Fig. S4 ) as well as the presence of OCLN ( Fig. S4 ). Electron micrographs also revealed tight junctions, as well as primary cilia, extensive microvilli, multi-vesicular bodies and numerous extracellular vesicles ( Fig. 3D ). We directly assessed barrier function by examining the entry of fluorescently labeled dextrans of varying molecular weights, which were completely excluded from the organoid ( Fig. 3E , Fig. 3F ).

To test for more selective permeability, we applied therapeutically relevant small molecules and assayed their permeability by NMR analysis ( Fig. 4A , Table S1 ). As a proof of principle, we tested dopamine (Dopa) and its precursor, Levodopa (L-Dopa), since these are similar molecules with very different permeability in vivo . Dopa does not enter the brain in vivo , whereas L-Dopa is actively transported in to the CSF via the LAT-1 transporter ( 23 , 24 ). We incubated the organoids with Dopa, and L-Dopa in the presence of Carbidopa, a small molecule that prevents conversion of L-Dopa into Dopa ( 25 ). After 2h, both compounds were detectable in the media but only L-Dopa was detectable in the organoid internal fluid demonstrating that our model exhibited the same selectivity as in vivo ( Fig. 4B , Fig. S5 ). LAT-1 was expressed on the ChP organoid epithelium ( Fig. 4C-D ), explaining the proper transport of L-Dopa in our assay. We also detected expression of efflux pump P-glycoprotein 1 (Pgp/MDR1) throughout the apicobasal axis ( Fig. 4C ). Pgp localization in ChP has been somewhat controversial ( 26 ); however, it is reported to have a role in pumping molecules from the CSF to the blood ( 26 , 27 ). These findings would suggest the Pgp is expressed in the human ChP. Additionally, ChP efflux transporters MRP1 and MRP4 ( 26 , 28 ) were localized on ChP organoid epithelium ( Fig. 4D , Fig. 4E ). These results suggest that ChP organoids express transporters that are critical for the correct function of the B-CSF-B in human brain.

We next tested whether the system could quantitatively predict drug permeability. We tested bupropionyl, an antidepressant known to readily cross the BBB ( 29 ), and two chemotherapeutic compounds, methotrexate and vincristine, which poorly cross the BBB due to the actions of efflux transporters MRP1/4 and Pgp, respectively ( 30 , 31 ). As expected, bupropionyl was readily detectable in the organoid internal fluid after 2h, while methotrexate and vincristine were completely excluded from the internal fluid ( Fig. 4F , Fig. S6, S7 ). We found high correlation between in vitro fluid/media ratios and the in vivo CSF/plasma ratios reported in the literature for the same drugs (R 2 =0.9921) ( Fig. 4G , Table S2 ). The values corresponded remarkably well (as indicated by a slope of 1.004), indicating that this in vitro system can qualitatively and quantitatively recapitulate the permeability of drugs reported in vivo .

To test whether ChP organoids could predict CNS permeability of novel drugs, we turned to Sephin 1, an inhibitor of the regulatory subunit PPP1R15A of protein phosphatase 1 ( 32 ). Clinical trials for this promising candidate have recently begun but data for this molecule in humans is not yet available. Sephin 1 was detectable in organoid internal fluid, indicating that this compound could also cross the human CNS barrier ( Fig. 4H , Fig. S6 ). Notably, however, the permeability in the human organoid model was much lower than that described in mice ( Fig. 4G ). This may indicate potential species-related differences in the CNS permeability of this compound, though an in vitro difference cannot be excluded.

Issues related to the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs account for most clinical trial failures ( 33 ). One example involved the compound BIA-10-2474, a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor that was in development for treatment of chronic pain and multiple sclerosis ( 34 , 35 ). Phase I clinical trials were halted when trial participants exhibited severe neurotoxicity, with one fatality ( 34 , 36 ). Investigations hypothesized toxic drug accumulation in the brain that was not evident in any animal model tested ( 34 , 36 , 37 ). However, the exact cause remains unknown. We compared the pharmacokinetic profile of BIA-10-2474 to a safe compound, bupropionyl, which crosses the barrier but has not been shown to accumulate. Similar to bupropionyl, BIA-10-2474 crossed the ChP epithelial barrier after 2h incubation ( Fig. 4I , Fig. S8 ). However, compared to the bupropionyl, which stabilized to baseline levels after 24h, BIA-10-2474 continued to accumulate in the organoid fluid ( Fig. 4J ). These data are consistent with the theory that BIA-10-2474 accumulated in the brains of the trial participants.

## ChP organoids secrete a CSF-like fluid highly similar toin vivoCSF
The other key function of the ChP is production of CSF. We detected expression of transporters involved in CSF secretion including the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and the key enzymes for generation of the gradient driving CSF secretion, CA2 and CA12, ( 38 ) ( Fig. 5A ). Staining revealed apical localization of AQP1, similar to in vivo ( Fig. 5B ). Consistent with the unique role of ChP in the transport of folate and vitamin C, both vital for brain function ( 39 , 40 ), we also detected expression of specific transporters involved in the trafficking of these nutrients: SLC23A2 (vitamin C) and SLC46A2 (folate) ( Fig. 5A ).

To investigate whether the colourless fluid inside ChP organoids could represent an in vitro CSF-like fluid (iCSF), we performed mass spectrometry analysis of extracted fluid (5 batches of H9, 6 batches of H1 and 1 batch of iPSCs IMR-90), compared to 3 different in vivo samples (human adult telencephalic CSF, mouse embryonic CSF at E13.5, and fetal bovine CSF) ( Table S3-S4 ) and media. We detected 1,618 proteins in ChP organoid iCSF, 851 of which were reliably detected in more than one iCSF sample ( Supplementary Data 1 ). Gene Ontology Analysis revealed enrichment in GO:CC categories “extracellular vesicle” and “extracellular space”, and GO:BP categories “export from cell” and “secretion from cell” ( Fig. 5C ). The most abundant proteins in the iCSF largely overlapped with proteins present in vivo ( Fig. S9A ). Indeed, of the 50 most abundant proteins detected in organoid iCSF, 49 were also detected in in vivo samples ( Fig. 5D ). Comparison of all the proteins detected revealed a large overlap between iCSF and in vivo samples ( Fig. 5E , Fig. S9B ). We could detect clinically relevant biomarkers, for example APOE, Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), Serpin Family F Member 1 (SERPINF1), and Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2) ( Table S5 ).

To ascertain the similarity to in vivo , we examined proteins detected reproducibly in in vivo samples but not in organoid iCSF ( Fig. S9C ) as these could be factors the organoid failed to produce. Proteins detected exclusively in the in vivo CSF samples showed enrichment in GO:CC “blood microparticle”, GO:BP “platelet degranulation” and GO:MF “Oxygen carrier activity” ( Fig. S9D ). This suggests these are factors coming from the blood, either through transport across the B-CSF-B or as collection artifacts through blood contamination. These would not be expected to be present in ChP organoids as they lack a vascular system and blood, and hence represent the ChP in isolation.

## ChP-CSF organoids progressively mature over time
ChP organoids progressively expressed more mature markers ( Fig. 2D-E ). To test whether the composition of iCSF also matured over time, we compared proteins in iCSF to published datasets of normal human embryonic, pediatric, and adult CSF ( Supplementary Data 2 ). We observed overlap with all three human age ranges, including a number of genes shared with the more mature timepoints ( Fig. 5F ). A number of proteins in iCSF changed abundance over time, with a marked shift between the day 58 and 68 time points ( Fig. S9A ). We further analyzed early (abundant before day 60) and late (abundant after day 60) proteins ( Fig. S10A ). Whereas early abundant proteins were overlapping with embryonic and fetal in vivo samples and datasets, late abundant proteins overlapped more with pediatric and adult stages ( Fig. 5G ).

We next examined factors known to exhibit changes in CSF levels over time ( Fig. S10B ). Abundant extracellular matrix proteins (laminin, fibronectin, and collagens) were shared with human embryonic CSF at the earliest time points ( Fig. 5G , Fig. S10B ). IGF2 is an important signaling factor in developing CSF ( 2 ). We observed a number of IGF factors present in iCSF, enriched in the REAC category “Regulation of Insulin-like Growth Factor” ( Fig. 5C ). IGF2 was highly abundant with levels dropping off at the latest stage tested of 146 days ( Fig. S10B , Fig. S10C ) closely matching the pattern in vivo , where IGF2 was detected in developing embryonic, fetal, and pediatric CSF ( Fig. 5G ).

We next examined proteins whose expression should increase in postnatal and adult CSF. We observed a number of lipoproteins in organoid iCSF, such as APOE, clusterin (CLU), APOD and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), which increased over time and were shared with adult in vivo CSF ( Fig. S10B ). Similarly, we observed marked presence of lipid droplets at later stages ( Fig. S10D ). Finally, we observed a number of other markers increasing with time, including retinol binding protein 1 (RBP1), ceruloplasmin (CP), and complement proteins (C1R and C4B) ( Fig. S10B ). Together, these results suggest that late stage organoids (older than 60 days) recapitulate functionality of pediatric and even adult ChP, with production of more mature CSF-like fluid by 100 days.

## Identification of the tissue source of key CSF components
Organoids represent tissues in isolation, lacking cell types such as vasculature and an immune system. Although this can be a limitation, we viewed this as a strength when examining secretion of a biological fluid such as CSF. This isolation can be leveraged to reveal factors from external sources, such as surrounding brain tissue or filtered from the blood, versus those made de novo by the ChP itself. To explore which CSF factors may be filtered, rather than made de novo , we examined iCSF proteins also present in fresh media ( Fig. S10E ). Many of these factors were also shared with in vivo CSF samples, suggesting these may be filtered into the CSF also in vivo .

CSF composition may also be influenced by surrounding brain tissue. We therefore examined organoid fluid from telencephalic organoids of mixed identity, which would include ChP. The fluid largely overlapped that of pure ChP organoids ( Fig. S10F ), suggesting CSF composition is primarily determined by ChP secretion. However, a number of proteins were specific to mixed identity organoids, 11 of which were shared with in vivo samples ( Fig. S10G ). These may represent bona fide brain-derived factors such as secretogranin-1 (CHGB), a neuroendocrine secretory protein, and NDRG2, an astrocyte expressed protein implicated in neurite outgrowth. The vast majority of proteins (1,589 of 1,618) were not shared with media, suggesting de novo ChP secretion ( Fig. 5H ). Overall, these findings suggest that CSF composition is largely dictated by ChP secretion, with a subset of components being filtered from the blood and produced by surrounding brain tissue.

## Merging proteomic and transcriptomic data reveals cell-type specific secretion and identifies novel ChP epithelial subtypes
To identify specific ChP cell types responsible for secretion of CSF components, we examined expression in scRNA-seq of key factors present in iCSF. The developmental signaling factor IGF2 was expressed in the ChP stroma ( Fig. S11A ), but also later within the mature ChP epithelium ( Fig. S11B, Fig. S11C ). More mature factors were specifically expressed within the mature ChP epithelium ( Fig. S11A, S11D ), while biomarkers exhibited varying expression patterns across ChP clusters ( Fig. S11E ). These findings provide insight into which cells within the ChP produce key secreted proteins.

Although several secreted proteins were expressed broadly among mature ChP cells (i.e. PLTP, CP) others such as IGF2, COL1A1, and C1R exhibited more restricted expression ( Fig. S11A ), suggesting the existence of ChP epithelial subtypes involved in secretion of specific CSF components. We therefore performed sub-clustering of the mature ChP cluster and identified four prominent clusters ( Fig. 6A ). Differential gene expression analysis of these clusters revealed a cluster expressing markers of ChP epithelium (HTR2C and CLDN5), but also high levels of mitochondrial genes ( Fig. 6B-C , Fig. S12A-B ). The second most abundant cluster instead showed marked down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, but upregulation of microtubule cytoskeletal and ciliary assembly factors ( Fig. 6B-C ).

Some studies of ChP ultrastructure reported the existence of “dark” and “light” cells ( 7 ), but nothing is known about their molecular identities. Dark cells, or “mitochondria-rich cells”, have also been observed in other secretory organs ( 41 ). These cells also lack cilia. We therefore hypothesized that the two most abundant clusters of the ChP epithelium may be dark and light epithelial cells with opposite expression of mitochondrial and ciliary genes. Electron micrographs revealed abundant dark cells with interspersed light cells with a ciliary basal body ( Fig. 6D ). We observed nonhomogeneous expression of the mitochondrial marker CARD19, the ciliary transcription factor FOXJ1 and the ciliary markers ARL13B and CCDC67 in subsets of cells ( Fig. 6E , Fig. 6F , Fig. S12C ). These results provide a first look at the molecular and cell biological hallmarks of dark and light ChP epithelial cells.

Closer examination of differential gene expression in the third cluster of ChP epithelial cells revealed markers typical of myoepithelial cells ( Fig. 6B , Fig. 6C , Fig. S12A-B ), a cell type described in secretory glands. These cells express contractile actin and myosin, similar to smooth muscle cells (α-SMA), yet are bona fide epithelial cells expressing markers such as keratin 17 (KRT17) Fig. 6B-C ). Furthermore, staining for α-SMA and transgelin (TAGLN), revealed their expression in a subset of cells within the epithelium ( Fig. 6G ). Finally, we observed a cluster of cells expressing markers of DNA replication and cell cycle ( Fig. 6B-C , Fig. S12A-B ), possibly indicating dividing cells. Indeed, we could observe occasional dividing PH3+ cells in mature ChP epithelium, decreasing over time ( Fig. S12D ). These findings suggest the presence of a limited number of dividing mature epithelial cells, as well as contractile cells, which had not been described in the ChP and may help promote CSF secretion, similar to secretory glands elsewhere in the body.

We next took an unbiased approach to explore cell type-specific secretion by looking at overlapping genes between mass spectrometry analysis and scRNA-seq ( Fig. 7A , Supplementary Data 3 ). We examined specific genes of interest in this context, such as IGF2, which was restricted to dark cells of the ChP epithelium ( Fig. 7B , Fig. S13A ), consistent with its staining pattern ( Fig. 7C ). The expression of more mature marker RBP1 in dark cells ( Fig. 7A ), was also further confirmed by immunostaining ( Fig. S13B ). Finally, a number of biomarkers were specifically produced by epithelial subtypes, including SERPINF1, IGFBP7, PARK7, and APOE ( Fig 7A , Fig. S13C ). Overall, these findings provide insight into specific cell types and their secretions within the ChP epithelium.

## Identification of CSF proteins secreted by the developing human ChP
ChP organoids provide a model system for developing human ChP and CSF. We therefore focused on iCSF-unique factors. As none of the in vivo samples tested here were from developing human CSF, any CSF components unique to the ChP organoids could in fact represent either in vitro -specific or human-specific developmental factors. We identified 24 proteins that were reproducibly abundant in ChP iCSF but absent in mouse and bovine developing CSF as well as adult human CSF ( Fig. 7D ). We then queried published datasets of human developing CSF from fetal and pediatric stages, which revealed some overlap with known human developmental CSF factors whereas others had not been observed before but are predicted to be secreted proteins ( Fig. 7D , Fig. 7E ).

One human-specific developmental secreted protein stood out, LGALS3BP, as it has also been identified in outer radial glial progenitors of the human fetal brain ( 42 ). We therefore examined the expression of this factor further and found it to be present in neural progenitors ( Fig. S13D ) but more abundant in the ChP ( Fig. S13E ), specifically in dark, myoepithelial, and dividing cells, but less in light cells ( Fig. 7E ). Immunohistochemistry also revealed abundant, broad staining throughout the ChP epithelium ( Fig. 7F ). These findings highlight a number of promising candidate signaling proteins that may play important roles in human brain development.

## Discussion
We present ChP organoids for the investigation of development and function of the human ChP. Using this in vitro organoid model, we were able to demonstrate the two key functions of the ChP: barrier formation and CSF secretion. ChP organoids are selective to highly similar small molecules. This model matches the selectivity of the human blood-CNS barrier in vivo , and it can predict CNS permeability of both known and novel drug compounds.

There is an increasing demand for more effective CNS drugs. New drugs too often progress to clinical trial before failing for lack of efficacy, inability to cross in to the CNS, or limited translatability from animal models ( 43 ). ChP organoids could be exploited for preclinical testing to identify new modes of drug entry into the CNS.

We further show that the fluid secreted by ChP organoids represents an authentic biological fluid, separate from the media, and exhibiting a high degree of similarity to CSF in vivo . The organoids and CSF-like fluid also mature over time, reaching a state highly similar to postnatal stages and even adulthood. This would enable the study of disease-related biomarkers, whose functions are still not well understood. The ChP is relatively understudied, but it is garnering increasing attention due to its important roles in development and diseases such as neurodegeneration.

Finally, we have leveraged the isolated nature of ChP organoids to identify and molecularly describe novel ChP epithelial cell types and to identify their specific CSF secretions. With this model we were able to disentangle CSF components that are specifically made by the ChP, from those transported across or generated by the surrounding brain tissue. This revealed a number of key developmental factors and human-specific signaling proteins that may play key roles in brain development and homeostasis. We are hopeful that with this information in hand, further studies can begin to shed light on the vital functions of the ChP in brain development and disease.
