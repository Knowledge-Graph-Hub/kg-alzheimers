Age-related myelin degradation burdens the clearance function of microglia during aging

# Abstract
Myelin is synthesized as a multilamellar membrane, but the mechanisms of membrane turnover are unknown. We found that myelin pieces were gradually released from aging myelin sheaths and were subsequently cleared by microglia. Myelin fragmentation increased with age and led to the formation of insoluble, lipofuscin-like lysosomal inclusions in microglia. Thus, age-related myelin fragmentation is substantial, leading to lysosomal storage and contributing to microglial senescence and immune dysfunction in aging.

Mice carrying a conditional Rab7 allele where the first exon is flanked by loxP sites ( Rab7 loxP / loxP ; ref. 21) were crossed with mice with a tamoxifen inducible Cre-mediated recombination system ( Cre-ERT2 ) driven by a CX3CR1 promoter to generate mice whose macrophages and microglia lacked the Rab7 protein. In the latter mouse line the cre-ERT2 along with a loxP -flanked neomycin resistance cassette replaces CX3CR1 exon 2 (ref. 22). To remove the neomycin resistance cassette from the CX3CR1 creERT2-neo locus by Cre-mediated excision, these mice were crossed to Ella cre (E2A Cre, Deleter-Cre) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, B6.FVB-Tg(EIIacre) C5379Lmgd/J, stock number: 003724). In the obtained chimeric mice ( CX3CR1 +/creERT2-neo ; Ella +/cre ) removal of the neomycin cassette was confirmed with PCR using the primer pair 5′-CACGGGGGAGGCAGAGGGTTT-3′ and 5′-GCGGAGCACGGGCCACATTTC-3′, which results in amplification of a 500-bp fragment indicative of the CX3CR1 +/creERT2 locus without the neomycin cassette, and a 1,800-bp product specific for the CX3CR1 +/creERT2 locus with the neomycin cassette. To remove the Ella cre locus from the chimeric mice with the excised neomycin cassette, these mice were mated with C57BL/6J wild-type mice. PCR reactions were done using two set of primers: sense Ella promoter (P1): 5′-AGATGACGTAGTTTTCGCGCTT-3′ and antisense Cre (P2): 5′-TCCG GTTATTCAACTTGCAC-3′; and P3: 5′-TATCTTCTATATCTTCAGGCGC-3′ and P4: 5′-GTGAACGAACCTGGTCGAAATCAG-3′. The combination of P1 and P2 amplified a 387-bp product specific for the Ella cre locus, and the mix of P3 and P4 produced a 223-bp fragment for CX3CR1 creERT2 locus. To obtain double transgenic mice ( CX3CR1 +/creERT2 ; Rab7 loxP / loxP ) two sets of breedings were arranged with CX3CR1 +/creERT2 and Rab7 loxP / loxP mice. To genotype the offspring of these breeding sets, two distinct PCR reactions using the combination of P3 and P4 and the following primer pair were done: wild-type Rab7 allele: 5′-CTCACTCACTCCTAAATGG-3′ and loxP -flanked Rab7 allele: 5′-TTAGGCTGTATGTATGTGC-3′. PCR products amplified by the latter primer pair were a 550-bp band specific for wild-type Rab7 and a 580-bp band representing the loxP -flanked Rab7 allele (i.e., a loxP -flanked allele without the neomycin cassette).

Conditional deletion of Rab7 in microglia cells of CX3CR1 +/creERT2 ; Rab7 loxP/loxP mice was induced by tamoxifen injection at 3 weeks of age. Tamoxifen (Sigma T5648) was dissolved in filtersterilized corn oil to make solution of 10 mg/ml. The solution was protected from light and placed on a roller mixer to be dissolved over night at 37 °C. It was administrated via intraperitoneal injection once every 24 h for 5 consecutive days. The injection dose was determined by weight, using approximately 75 mg tamoxifen/kg body weight. For adult mice, a standard dose of 100 μl tamoxifen/ corn oil solution was effective to induce Cre recombinase activity. Control mice of the same genotype received corn oil vehicle only.

To test the activity of Cre recombinase in microglia, CX3CR1 +/creER ;Rab7 loxP / loxP mice were crossed to reporter mice carrying a tdTomato gene located downstream of a loxP -flanked STOP cassette. The offspring of this breeding, CX3CR1 +/creER ; Rab7 loxP/+ ; tdTomato + , were injected with tamoxifen at 3 weeks of age. To confirm deletion of the Rab7 gene mediated by CX3CR1 -driven expression of Cre recombinase, 1 and 6 weeks after tamoxifen injection, microglia were isolated and Rab7 transcripts measured by relative reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) using primers 5′-GGAATCGGACGTCTCTGTTG-3′ and 5′-AGTCCCCCAGGATGATGAC-3′, designed with NCBI Primer Blast software. The expression of the target gene was measured in relation to internal levels of Gapdh and Rn18s as reference genes. The quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The relative change in gene expression was analyzed by the ΔCt method, and normalized to the control samples.

Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 14% chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) using a MPII mini peristaltic pump (Harvard Apparatus) (flow rate: 3 ml/min). Brain tissue was postfixed in 4% PFA overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1× PBS until the brain sank (at least 1 d). The tissue was bound to the specimen block using Tissue-Tek O.C.T., frozen on dry ice and cut in coronal direction using cryostat Leica CM 1900. The sections were collected in cryoprotective solution (25% glycerol and 25% ethylene glycol in PBS). Free-floating sections were rinsed with 1× PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 in a 24-well plate. Permeabilization was performed in 0.5% Triton X-100 with incubation time varying from 10 to 30 min depending on the primary antibody. To block endogenous mouse tissue immunoglobulins, Fab-fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Dianova) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed briefly and incubated in 100% blocking solution (2.5% FCS, 2.5% BSA, 2.5% fish gelatin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies, diluted in 10% blocking solution, were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, after washing the sections three times with PBS for 10 min, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies, diluted in 10% blocking solution, for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with PBS followed by distilled H 2 O and mounted using fluorescence mounting medium (Dako) on Superfrost Plus slides.

3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) immunohistostaining was performed using VECTASTAIN® ABC Kit standard (Vector Laboratories). Free-floating cryosections were transferred to a 24-well plate and washed three times with PBS. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 , incubated for 20 min at 4 °C, and washed out with PBS. Then 100% blocking solution (as before) was added to the sections and they were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, diluted in 10% blocking solution. Subsequently, the sections were washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, AB solution containing 20 μl reagent A (Avidin DH) and 20 μl reagent B (biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H) in PBS was added to the sections and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes, staining was developed using a DAB staining kit (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories). The incubation time varied depending on the primary antibody. The DAB reaction was stopped with distilled water; sections were washed with PBS and placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides for 2–3 d to dry. The sections were rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and finally in water, stained with hematoxylin for 1 min, dehydrated using increasing percentages of alcohol, cleared in xylol (Chemie Vertrieb GmbH) and mounted with Depex.

To reduce lipofuscin autofluorescence in old brain tissues for immunohistochemistry 23 , the sections were dipped briefly in distilled water and treated with 10 mM CuSO 4 (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA) in a buffer containing 50 mM ammonium acetate and 100 μM EDTA, pH 4.5, for 90 min on a shaker. The sections were washed briefly in distilled H 2 O and transferred to PBS. Autofluorescence was removed by means of the dye separation tool on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.

Primary antibodies: Iba1 (Wako, Cat. No., 019-19741), Mac-2 (Biolegend, Cat. No., 125401) MHC-II (Novus Biologicals, Cat. No., NB100-65541), MBP (Covance, Cat. No., SMI-99), PLP (from K.-A. Nave, Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine, Göttingen), MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein, Millipore, Cat. No., MAB1567), Lamp1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No., sc-19992) and CD68 (Bio-Rad, Cat. No., MCA1957GA). Secondary antibodies: for DAB staining we used goat anti-rat biotinylated immunoglobulin G (Vector Laboratories, Cat. No. BA-9400) and for fluorescence microscopy we used Alexa Fluor 488-, 647- and 555-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen, Cat. Nos. A-11034, A-28175, A-21422, A-21443, A27018 and A27039, respectively).

For high pressure freezing, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and freshly extracted optic nerves were cryofixed using a high-pressure freezer (Leica HPM100) and further processed by freeze substitution and EPON-embedding following the tannic acid–OsO 4 protocol as described in Möbius et al . 24 . Ultrathin cross-sections 50 (50 nm) of the retinal ends were obtained with an Ultracut S ultramicrotome (Leica) and contrasted as described previously 25 .

For conventional fixed preparations the mouse brain was fixed by transcardial perfusion using 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.5% NaCl. The brain was extracted and postfixed in the same fixative solution overnight. The tissue was sectioned into 200-μm-thick vibratome sections. Rostral and caudal regions of the corpus callosum were cut and postfixed in a solution of 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. Following washing with distilled water the sections were stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 1 h, dehydrated in a serial dilution of ethanol, and cleared in propylene oxide, embedded in Epon, and incubated at 60 °C for 24 h. The tissues in Epon blocks were then trimmed and reoriented so that ultrathin (60 nm) cross-sections of the midline corpus callosum could be cut using the ultramicrotome. Ultrathin sections were collected on collodion-coated copper grids.

Images were processed and analyzed with Imaris (64× version 7.7.1) and ImageJ 1.41 image processing software. The quantification was performed with investigators blind to the experimental conditions. To estimate the number of Iba1-positive cells, confocal stacks (step size: 0.8 μm) were captured in the z -direction from the whole region of interest with 20× or 40× objectives of a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. An area 1 mm 2 in the region of interest was selected, and the total number of Iba1-positive cell bodies and as well as the number of Iba1-positive cells with internalized components (such as FITC-dextran, MBP or lipofuscin) were counted using the cell counter plugin in ImageJ. In addition, to confirm the quantification performed by ImageJ, cell counting was done automatically using Imaris software. Briefly, a region of interest was segmented and a spots layer was created (radius scale: 8) for each marker (Iba1 and FITC/MBP/LF) in the corresponding channel, and using those spots the cells were counted automatically. The colocalized spots were determined using a distance threshold set to 0.2 μm.

The sizes of lipofuscin accumulations within at least 40 microglia cells were quantified. Individual cells were analyzed using Imaris software as following. An area of 1 mm 2 in cortical white matter and another in the striatum were chosen and confocal z -stacks (step size: 0.8 μm) were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (40× objective). A three-dimensional image was generated in ImarisSurpass view. The “surface” option in the tool bar was selected, and then a region of interest including lipofuscin compartment within a single cell was segmented in the third channel (far red). The threshold was manually set to cover the whole volume of the compartment in the cell by creating a surface.

To determine myelin and microglia contact area, confocal z -stacks (step size: 0.8 μm) were taken in the striatum with the 40× objective of a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. A three-dimensional image from the whole area was created using the Surpass view in Imaris software. To measure the surface area of each microglia cell in contact with myelin, a single cell, including the cell body and all processes in total focus, was segmented. We ensured the entire cell was covered by choosing the “spots” option in the tool bar and adjusting the appropriate threshold. Next, the area labeled with MBP against myelin around the cell of interest was segmented. By activating the “surface” in the tool bar a surface was created over that area. The total number of spots (representing cell process or cell body) and the number of spots close to the surface (representing myelin) were calculated using distance threshold 0.4 μm. Finally, using these numbers the percentage of cell area in contact with myelin was calculated. 230 cells were analyzed.

Imaris software was used to measure the area microglia processes. Forty cells taken from random regions of the brain were analyzed. Confocal z -stacks (step size: 0.8 μm) were acquired from different areas in cortical white matter, corpus callosum and striatum using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with a 40× objective. A three-dimensional image was generated in Imaris Surpass view. Then a microglia cell, including the whole cell body and all its processes in focus, was segmented as a region of interest. Subsequently, to measure the whole area occupied by the single microglia, a surface was created over the whole cell. Additionally, the cell body of each microglia cell was segmented, and its area was quantified by creating a surface. Eventually, the area of the cell body was subtracted from the whole cell area to obtain the area of microglia processes. To visualize inside the cell, the surface was cut using the clipping plane in Imaris software.

For optimal dissociation of tissue samples, brain tissue from mice was dissociated using a Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Papain) (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, the mice were perfused with cold PBS, the brain was removed and cut into small pieces, and then the tissue was dissociated by enzymatic digestion. Next, the tissue was dissociated mechanically by wide- and narrow-tipped pipettes until no tissue pieces remained. The suspension was pressed through a 40-μm cell strainer and washed twice with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). To remove myelin, the tissue pellet was resuspended in 37% Percoll (Sigma), overlaid on 70% Percoll in DMEM containing 2% FCS (fetal calf serum), and centrifuged at 500 g for 30 min. The membrane fraction that formed on the top of the 37% Percoll gradient was removed using a vacuum pump. The thin fraction, containing a single-cell suspension, in the interface between 37% and 70% Percoll was then carefully taken out and washed with the medium and MACS rinsing solution (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS). Microglia were then isolated from the single-cell suspension by MACS technology. The suspension was incubated with CD11b (microglia) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4 °C for 15 min, after washing with MACS rinsing solution, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer, applied to a MACS column placed in the magnetic field, and, after being washed three times with 500 μl MACS buffer, CD11b-positive cells (microglia) were flushed out of the column and centrifuged at 400 g for 8 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS and washed one more time. The final pellet was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for future use.

The preparation of sarkosyl-insoluble membrane fraction was performed as described previously 26 . Briefly, the pellet containing 1.5 × 10 6 microglia isolated from 12-month-old mice resuspended in PBS was resuspended again in 300 μl 10% sarkosyl and 1 μl of 10 μg/ml β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h on a roller. To prepare the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, the solution was transferred into Beckman 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuged at 130,000 g for 35 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml cold TBS (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl) and centrifuged again at 130,000 g for 35 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed one more time in cold TBS. The supernatant was removed carefully and the final pellet (sarkosylinsoluble fraction, SIF) was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C for further use. To examine the solubility of myelin membrane in sarkosyl, the same experiment was done with 1.5 μg of pure myelin membrane. Western blotting was performed using a polyclonal MBP antibody (Dako, 1:1,000, Cat. No. A0623).

The myelin from 8-week-old C57BL/6 mouse brains was isolated by sequential centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient according to a protocol previously described 27 , with some modifications. The ultracentrifugation was done using a SW41 Ti rotor. The brain tissues were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a solution containing 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, and protease inhibitor. The homogenized tissue was layered on a sucrose gradient composed of 0.32 M and 0.85 M sucrose prepared in 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 75,000 g for 30 min with low deceleration and acceleration. The crude myelin fraction was removed from the interface, suspended in distilled water and centrifuged at 75,000 g for 15 min. The pellet was subjected to two rounds of hypo-osmotic shock by resuspension in 10 ml ice-cold water, with centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min. For purification of myelin, the pellet obtained from the last step was dissolved in HEPES/EDTA buffer and placed over the sucrose gradient; all the centrifugation steps and hypo-osmotic shocks were then repeated as before. Eventually, the purified myelin pellet was resuspended in 1 ml HEPES/EDTA buffer and stored at −20 °C.

Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) were prepared from P0–P2 C57BL/6N mice according to a slightly modified protocol 28 . OHSCs were kept in a humidified atmosphere at 35 °C and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed every other day.

To deplete microglia, OHSCs were treated with clodronate disodium salt. Clodronate was solved in ultrapure H 2 O in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. OHSCs were incubated with 100 μg clodronate per ml standard culture medium for 24 h at 35 °C. Subsequently, OHSCs were rinsed with warm PBS and placed in fresh culture medium. Microglia-depleted OHSCs were kept at least for 7 d in vitro before experiment. The medium was changed every other day.

To replenish microglia, microglia were isolated from 8-month-old wild-type and PMD mice by means of density gradient centrifugation using Percoll (Sigma). Mice were perfused with cold 1× PBS, and the cerebrum alone was homogenized in a HBSS containing 0.5% glucose (Sigma) and 15 mM HEPES using a Dounce homogenizer. The tissue was dissociated mechanically by wide-and narrow-tipped pipettes until no tissue pieces remained. The suspension was applied to a 40-μm cell strainer and washed twice with HBSS. Subsequently, the tissue pellet was resuspended in 75% Percoll (Sigma), overlaid on 25% Percoll in PBS, and centrifuged at 800 g for 30 min. A cloudy layer, containing microglia, in the interface between 25% and 75% Percoll was then carefully collected and cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 min. The cell number was adjusted to obtain 1,000 cells/μl. Subsequently, 2 μl of cell suspension (2,000 cells) were added on top of each microglia-depleted tissue slice. The replenished OHSCs were maintained for 2 weeks so that the newly added microglia were distributed evenly and ramified 28 .

To perform uptake experiments, 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM)-labeled synthetic human amyloid β (Aβ) peptide with amino acids 1−42 was purchased from AnaSpec and prepared according to instructions described previously 29 . Before adding it to OHSCs, Aβ was sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasound water bath and then mixed by vortex for 2 min. The replenished OHSCs were treated twice with Aβ containing solution (2 μl of a 15 μM solution each time) every second day. OHSCs were analyzed 24 h after the last treatment.

Purified myelin pellets were resuspended in sterile PBS and the protein concentration in the myelin was then measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay, based on the Bradford method. For immunofluorescence analysis, myelin was labeled with PKH26 (Sigma) and then washed in PBS by centrifugation at 15,000 g . The final pellet was resuspended in the culture medium. Before adding it to the slice culture, the myelin was sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasound water bath.

To perform myelin uptake experiments, 4 μg of purified myelin was added twice onto each slice twice. The first treatment started 3 d after OHSC culture and the second started 1 d later. OHSCs were fixed with 4% PFA 3 d after the last treatment with myelin. The medium was changed every second day.

Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a solution (0.15 ml/25 g) containing 4% Rompun™ 2% (xylazine) (Bayer DVM for veterinary professionals) and 12.5% ketamine 10% (Medistar) in 0.9% NaCl, placed into stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments), and injected with 1.5 μg FITC-conjugated dextran (40 kDa; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in sterile PBS via a glass capillary microinjector at the following coordinates relative to bregma: 0.3 mm anterior, 1.2 mm lateral and 1.2 mm below cortical surface. Seven hours after injection the mice were perfused and the brain tissues were prepared and stained as described above.

Six weeks after tamoxifen injection, Rab7 conditional knockout mice ( Rab7 ΔMG ) as well as corresponding control mice ( Rab7 loxP / loxP ) were treated with 0.2% cuprizone for 4 weeks. The animals were returned to normal diet for another 4 weeks to induce remyelination and continued on the normal diet for 9, 15, 23 or 37 weeks after cuprizone treatment. Age-matched controls received the normal diet without cuprizone throughout the whole experiment.

Eight-week-old and 22-month-old mice (7 per group) were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (Ketavet, Pfizer; 100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (Rompun, Bayer HealthCare; 20 mg/kg bodyweight) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. All following steps were carried out on ice and using ice-cold solutions. Isolation of microglia was carried out as previously described 28 . Briefly, perfused brains were carefully removed, placed into a Petri dish and finely shredded with a scalpel. Subsequently, brain tissue were transferred into a tissue masher tube and slowly homogenized. Brain homogenate was eventually flushed with a Pasteur pipette through a 70-μm strainer filter and rinsed with 50 ml of Gibco HBSS 1× medium (Life Technologies). The cellular fraction was collected into a 50 ml Falcon tube and pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in a 35% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). The myelin fraction was removed by centrifugation on a density gradient as follows: 35% Percoll (bottom) and PBS (top). Centrifugation was carried out at 1,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C without a break. After centrifugation the myelin fraction had settled at the interface between the two gradients, while the cellular fraction was collected in the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, centrifuged (pellet wash) and eventually transferred into FACS tubes.

Splenocytes were collected by squeezing fragmented spleen tissue through a 70-μm strainer filter and subsequently rinsed with 50 ml of PBS. The cellular fraction was collected into a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged. The pellet was eventually transferred into FACS tubes.

Brain pellets devoid of myelin, as well as spleen pellets, were treated as follows: 15 min incubation with FC-receptor blocker (1:100), followed by 30 min incubation with anti-mouse CD45-FITC and anti-mouse CD11b-APC (1:200). Between each step pellets were washed in PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. All staining products were provided by eBioscience. Immediately before reading, samples were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000) for 1 min. DAPI is poorly permeable through the cell membrane, and therefore its signal was used to identify and select viable cells.

FACS analysis was performed with and eight-color LSR Fortessa from Becton Dickinson (BD Bioscience). Cells were hierarchically gated as follows: (1) FSC/SSC, selection of the microglia population, depending on cell granularity and dimension; (2) FSC-A/FSC-H, selection of single cells; (3) FSC-A/DAPI, selection of viable cells; and (4) final gating on microglia (CD11b + CD45 int ) and brain macrophages (CD11b + CD45 hi ). Cells with CD45-FITC fluorescence intensity higher than 10 4 were arbitrary considered CD45 hi . In spleen samples the CD11b + CD45 hi population was labeled “splenic macrophages”, while the CD11b − CD45 hi population was labeled “splenic”.

The sorted cells were homogenized in RLT buffer using QIAShredder (Qiagen), total RNA was extracted using micro-RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN). We used 1 μg of cDNA as the input for the Ion Xpress™ Plus Fragment Library Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) to generate barcoded libraries. Barcoded libraries were quantified using qRT-PCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit), pooled and clonally amplified on Ion Spheres (Ion One Touch 200 Template Kit v2, ThermoFisher Scientific) and sequenced on an Ion Proton sequencer (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Raw reads were sorted based on barcodes and were subjected to quality analysis using FASTQC. The sequences were subsequently aligned to the genome of Mus musculus (GRCm38/Mm10) using the TMAP aligner with default parameters. The reads mapping to unique locations were quantified using RefSeq Gene Annotations (v73) into genes. Differential gene expression analysis and hypergeometric pathway analysis using KEGG gene sets was performed using a commercial platform (Partek). Genes with fold changes greater than 2 and P -values less than 0.05 were considered for further hypergeometric pathway enrichment analysis.

All experiments were approved and conducted in accordance with animal protection laws approved by the Government of Lower Saxony, Germany. C57BL/6 mice were used for all experiments. The genotypes and ages of the animals are defined in the figure legends. We combined female and male mice for the experiments. They were kept in groups of three in standard plastic cages and maintained in a temperature-controlled environment (21 ± 2 °C) on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum .

Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and SPSS software. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. To compare two groups, a two-tailed Student’s t -test was applied. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was performed for comparison of more than two groups. When the sample size was small, a non-parametric test such as the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney test was applied. To analyze the interaction of age and genotype, or age and brain region, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used. A P -value of <0.05 was considered significant in all tests. All values are represented as mean ± s.d.
