# Title
Novel tau filament fold in corticobasal degeneration

# Abstract
Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that is characterised by motor and cognitive disturbances ( 1 – 3 ). A higher frequency of the H1 haplotype of MAPT , the tau gene, is present in cases of CBD than in controls ( 4 , 5 ) and genome-wide association studies have identified additional risk factors ( 6 ). By histology, astrocytic plaques are diagnostic of CBD ( 7 , 8 ), as are detergent-insoluble tau fragments of 37 kDa by SDS-PAGE ( 9 ). Like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), globular glial tauopathy (GGT) and argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) ( 10 ), CBD is characterised by abundant filamentous tau inclusions that are made of isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats (4R) ( 11 – 15 ). This distinguishes 4R tauopathies from Pick’s disease, filaments of which are made of three-repeat (3R) tau isoforms, and from Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), where both 3R and 4R tau isoforms are found in the filaments ( 16 ). Here we report the structures of tau filaments extracted from the brains of three individuals with CBD using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). They were identical between cases, but distinct from those of Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease and CTE ( 17 – 19 ). The core of CBD filaments comprises residues K274-E380 of tau, spanning the last residue of R1, the whole of R2, R3 and R4, as well as 12 amino acids after R4. It adopts a novel four-layered fold, which encloses a large non-proteinaceous density. The latter is surrounded by the side chains of lysine residues 290 and 294 from R2 and 370 from the sequence after R4. CBD is the first 4R tauopathy with filaments of known structure.

## Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Case 1 was a female from Japan who died aged 74 following a six year history of progressive memory loss and motor impairment. Case 2 was a female from Japan who died aged 79 following a nine year history of progressive memory impairment and spatial disorientation. Case 3 was a male from the U.S. who died aged 52 following a seven year history of personality changes and cognitive dysfunction. Neuropathologically, the brains of all three cases exhibited signs of CBD, with abundant 4R tau- and silver-positive neuronal inclusions, neuropil threads and astrocytic plaques ( Figure 1a-e ). Tufted astrocytes characteristic of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were not observed. By immunoblotting of the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, bands of 64 and 68 kDa were detected by antibodies RD4 and AT8, but not by RD3. Bands of 37 kDa were also seen, consistent with CBD ( Figure 1g ). No known disease-causing mutations were present in MAPT . All three cases were homozygous for A at position 152; A152T tau has been reported to be a risk factor for some tauopathies ( 39 , 40 ). Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing did not detect mutations known to cause Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. All three cases were homozygous for the H1 haplotype of MAPT . Two haplotypes, H1 and H2 , are present in the Caucasian population, with the H1 haplotype being over-represented in individuals with CBD and PSP ( 4 , 5 ). The Japanese population has only H1 ( 41 , 42 ). The APOE genotypes of CBD cases 1-3 were: case 1 (ε3/ε4), case 2 (ε3/ε3), case 3 (ε3/ε3).

Target enrichment made use of the SureSelectTX human all-exon library (V6, 58 Mb, Agilent) and high-throughput sequencing was carried out using a HiSeq4,000 (2x75-bp paired-end configuration, Illumina). Bioinformatics analyses were performed as described ( 43 ).

Sequencing libraries were prepared using 100 ng high-quality genomic DNA from cerebellum using Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit, and assessed using a Qubit and Agilent Bioanalyzer. High-throughput DNA sequencing was carried out on multiple libraries pooled in equal molarity using a NovaSeq6,000 (150-bp paired-end configuration, Illumina) and aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38 using BWA and Bwakit (v.0.7.15). ExpansionHunter was applied to estimate expansion numbers of short tandem repeats (v.2.5.5) and germline variants were identified with strelka2 (v.2.9.9), with default parameters for whole-genome sequence data. The variants were annotated for their effects with ANNOVAR ( 44 ).

Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the number of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats in the first intron of C9orf72 (Asuragen AmplideX PCR/CE C9orf72 kit). Internal standards were analysed along with samples to evaluate assay performance. Repeat numbers of up to 25 repeats were determined with an accuracy of ±1 repeat, and repeat numbers greater than 25 were determined with an accuracy of ±3 repeats.

For cryo-EM, sarkosyl-insoluble material was extracted from fresh-frozen frontal cortex of CBD cases 1-3, essentially as described ( 20 ). Briefly, tissues were homogenised in 20 volumes (v/w) extraction buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose and 1 mM EGTA. Homogenates were brought to 2% sarkosyl and incubated for 30 min. at 37°C. Following a 10 min. centrifugation at 20,000 g, the supernatants were spun at 100,000 g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 700 μl/g extraction buffer and centrifuged at 9,500 g for 10 min. For CBD cases 1 and 2, the supernatants were diluted 3-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10% sucrose and 0.2% sarkosyl and spun at 166,000 g for 30 min. For CBD case 3, the supernatant was spun at 100,000 g for 60 min and the pellet resuspended in 700 μl/g extraction buffer and centrifuged at 9,800 g. The supernatant was then spun at 100,000 g for 60 min. Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of CBD cases 1-3 were resuspended in 25 μl/g of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and used for cryo-EM. For immuno-EM the samples were diluted 5-10-fold. Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of approximately 2 g frontal cortex were used for cryo-EM.

Western blotting and immunogold negative-stain EM were carried out as described ( 45 ). Using the same procedures as described above, filaments were extracted from putamen of CBD cases 1-3, as well as from globus pallidus and thalamus of CBD case 3. For Western blotting, the samples were resolved on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex) and the primary antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 0.2% Tween-20, 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were: RD3 and RD4 ( 46 ) (Millipore), used at 1:4,000; AT8 ( 47 ) (specific for pS202/pT205 tau) (Thermo Fisher), used at 1:1,000 and anti-phospho-TDP-43 (pS409/pS410) ( 48 , 49 ) (Cosmo Bio), used at 1:1,000. For immuno-EM, primary antibodies were used at 1:50. They were: BR133 ( 28 ) (raised against tau residues 1-16), BR136 ( 18 ) (raised against tau residues 244-257), Anti-4R ( 38 , 50 ) (raised against tau residues 275-291), BR135 ( 28 ) (raised against tau residues 323-335), TauC4 ( 20 ) (raised against tau residues 354-369) and BR134 ( 28 ) (raised against tau residues 428-441). Histology and immunohistochemistry were carried out as described ( 51 ). Brain sections were 8 micron-thick and were counterstained with haematoxylin. Primary antibodies were: RD3 (1:1,000); RD4 (1:1,000); AT8 (1:300); anti-pS396 tau (1:1,000, Calbiochem); anti-TauC, specific for tau at residues 422-438 (1:1,000, Cosmo Bio); anti-phospho-TDP-43 (1:1,000); anti-FUS (1:200, Sigma); anti-poly-GA (1:1,000, Cosmo Bio); anti-α-tubulin (1:1,000, Sigma) and anti-influenza hemagglutinin (HA) (1:1,000, Sigma). Sections were silver-impregnated using the method of Gallyas-Braak to visualise inclusions ( 52 , 53 ).

Seeded aggregation was carried out as described ( 54 ), except that sarkosyl-insoluble tau from the frontal cortex of CBD cases 1-3 was used as seed. Briefly, 10 ng sarkosyl-insoluble tau seed and Multifectam (Promega) were added to SH-SY5Y cells transiently expressing HA-tagged 1N3R or 1N4R human tau. Mock transfections were done in the absence of tau seeds. After three days of culture, sarkosyl-insoluble and sarkosyl-soluble fractions were prepared and used for immunoblotting. Insoluble tau was detected with anti-HA and anti-pS396-tau antibodies. Total tau was detected with anti-TauC. Tau concentrations in the seeds from frontal cortex of CBD cases 1-3 were determined using the Tau ELISA kit Wako (FUJIFILM). The intensity of HA-positive bands in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions was quantified using Image J software.

Extracted tau filaments from frontal cortex were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 30 s, before being applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Thermo Fischer Vitrobot Mark IV. Images were acquired on a Gatan K2-Summit detector in counting mode using a Thermo Fischer Titan Krios microscope at 300 kV. A GIF-quantum energy filter (Gatan) was used with a slit width of 20 eV to remove inelastically scattered electrons. Further details are given in Extended Data Table 1 . Filaments widths and crossover distances were measured manually in the cryo-EM micrographs. Statistical analyses on these measurements were performed using a one-way ANOVA test, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (Prism, GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Movie frames were gain-corrected, aligned, dose-weighted and then summed into a single micrograph using MOTIONCOR2 ( 54 ). The micrographs were used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) using Gctf ( 55 ). All subsequent image-processing steps were performed using helical reconstruction methods in RELION 3.0 ( 25 , 56 , 57 ). Both types of filaments were selected manually in the micrographs, and the resulting data sets were processed independently. For Type I (narrow) filaments, 135,646 segments were extracted with an inter-box distance of 14.1 Å and a box size of 920 pixels. Initial reference-free 2D classification was performed with images that were downscaled to 230 pixels to speed up calculations. Segments contributing to suboptimal 2D class averages were discarded. Assuming a helical rise of 4.75 Å, a helical twist of -0.9° was estimated from the crossover distance of filaments in the micrographs. Using these parameters, an initial 3D reference was reconstructed from the 2D class averages de novo . We then re-extracted the selected segments without downscaling them, and with a smaller box of 330 pixels. Using these segments and the de novo initial model low-pass filtered to 15 Å, we carried out 3D auto-refinement. We then used the refined reconstruction, low-pass filtered to 15 Å, as reference for a 3D classification without further image alignment. The segments contributing to the best 3D class were used for subsequent 3D auto-refinement of 24,073 selected segments. Refinement of the helical parameters converged onto a helical twist of -0.845° and a helical rise of 4.786 Å. After Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement, the reconstruction was sharpened with a B-factor of -26.23 Å 2 ( Extended Data Table 1 ) using the standard post-processing procedure in RELION. The overall resolution of the final map was estimated as 3.2 Å from Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between the two independently refined half-maps, using phase-randomisation to correct for convolution effects of a generous, soft-edged solvent mask that extended to 30% of the height of the box ( 58 ). Local resolution estimates were obtained using the same phase-randomisation procedure, but with a soft spherical mask that was moved over the entire map. For Type II (wide) filaments, 129,812 segments were extracted with an inter-box distance of 14.1 Å and a box size of 460 pixels, which were downscaled to 230 pixels for reference-free 2D classification and particle selection. An initial 3D reference was again reconstructed from the 2D class averages de novo by assuming a helical rise of 4.75 Å and a helical twist of -0.65°, based on the estimated crossover distance of filaments. The resulting reconstruction suggested the presence of two-fold symmetry in the structure. To confirm whether this symmetry also had a translational component, we performed two 3D auto-refinements, one with C2 symmetry and one with C1 symmetry, but imposing a pseudo-2 1 screw axis. By comparing the results of the refinements, we found that the map obtained following the application of C2 symmetry was of higher resolution. The C2 map also showed separation of β-strands along the helical axis, which was absent in the map refined with the screw symmetry. We applied C2 symmetry in all subsequent refinements. Using 3D classification without image alignment, the segments contributing to the best 3D class were selected and used for 3D auto-refinement with optimisation of helical twist and rise. A final 3D auto-refinement of 20,752 selected segments in boxes of 330 pixels without downscaling converged onto a helical twist of -0.61° and the helical rise at 4.786 Å. Following Bayesian polishing ( 59 ) and CTF refinement, the overall resolution of the final map was estimated as 3.0 Å. For Type I and Type II tau filaments in CBD case 2 and CBD case 3, the dataset processing steps were similar to Type I and Type II tau filaments in CBD case 1, with the initial 3D references reconstructed de novo independently for each dataset.

The models of the cores of Type I and Type II filaments were built de novo in combination of both 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å resolution reconstructions from CBD case 1 using COOT ( 60 ). We started model building from the 301 PGGG 304 motif, with the aromatic side chains of H299 and Y310 not far away, and worked our way towards the N- and C-terminal regions by manually adding amino acids and by targeted real-space refinement in the high-resolution core part of Type II filaments. Tracing of the chain was confirmed by the fitting of the 332 PGGG 335 motif, which neighbours the side chains of H329 and H330. Since the density of side chains of N368-E380 was weak in the 3.0 Å reconstruction of Type II filaments, we assigned the side chains in this region following the 3.2 Å reconstruction of Type I filaments. The structure of one protofilament from Type II filaments was rigid-body fitted into the reconstruction of Type I filaments to build the model of Type I filaments. Because of the lack of interaction between two protofilaments, the conformations of the side chains of K343 and K347 in Type I filaments were assigned differently from their counterparts in Type II filaments, according to the reconstruction. Each model was then translated to give a stack of three consecutive monomers to preserve nearest-neighbour interactions for the middle chain in subsequent refinements. Because most residues adopted a β-strand conformation, hydrogen-bond restraints were imposed to preserve a parallel, in-register hydrogen bonding pattern in earlier stages of Fourier-space refinements. Local symmetry restraints were imposed to keep all β-strand rungs identical. Side chain clashes were detected using MOLPROBITY ( 61 ) and corrected by iterative cycles of real-space refinement in COOT and Fourier-space refinement in REFMAC ( 62 ) and PHENIX ( 63 ). For each refined structure, separate model refinements were performed against a single half-map, and the resulting model was compared to the other half-map to confirm the absence of overfitting ( Extended Data Figure 5a,b ). The final models were stable in refinements without additional restraints. Statistics for the final models are shown in Extended Data Table 1 .

The studies carried out at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science and at Indiana University were approved through the ethical review process at each Institution. Informed consent was obtained from the patients’ next of kin.
