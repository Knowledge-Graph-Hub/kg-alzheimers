Neurological associations of COVID-19

# Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.

## Introduction
As of May 19, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in more than 4·8 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 300 000 deaths. 1 It is the largest and most severe pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. 2 Although the most common and important presentation is with respiratory disease, reports of neurological features are increasing. These features appear to be a combination of non-specific complications of systemic disease, the effects of direct viral infection, or inflammation of the nervous system and vasculature, which can be para-infectious or post-infectious. In this Rapid Review, we consider which neurological manifestations might be expected for COVID-19, given what is known about related coronaviruses and respiratory viruses more broadly. We summarise the evidence to date for COVID-19, examine putative disease mechanisms, and finally suggest a framework for investigating patients with suspected COVID-19-associated neurological disease to support clinico-epidemiological, disease mechanism, and treatment studies.

## Evidence from other viruses
Before identification of SARS-CoV-2, six coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four of these coronaviruses cause seasonal, predominantly mild respiratory illness, and have a high incidence globally, accounting for 15–30% of upper respiratory tract infections. 3 The other two coronaviruses have led to major epidemics with deaths principally from respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by SARS-CoV in 2002–03, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV in 2012. 4 , 5 Both the more innocuous coronaviruses and these epidemic strains have been associated with occasional disease of the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS).

Both CNS and PNS disease were reported following SARS ( appendix pp 2–3 ). SARS-CoV was detected in CSF by RT-PCR in two of three cases of encephalopathy with seizures, 6 , 7 and was cultured from brain tissue at autopsy in the third. 8 Four patients with severe SARS developed neuromuscular disease, predominantly motor neuropathy, myopathy, or both, 9 which might have been SARS-specific or secondary to critical illness. 10 CNS involvement was described for five adults with MERS; two had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, two had cerebrovascular disease, and one had Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. 11 , 12 , 13 Neuropathy was described in three patients. 11 , 13 Human coronavirus OC43, a seasonal coronavirus, has caused encephalitis in an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency, 14 and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in an older immunocompetent child. 15 Headache, neck stiffness, and seizures were described among 22 children (median age 36 months; range 0·8–72 months) with suspected CNS infection and coronavirus IgM antibodies in their serum, CSF, or both. 16 Ten of these children had pleiocytosis and eight had brain imaging abnormalities. All 22 made a full recovery. 16

Neurological complications have also been described for other respiratory viruses, particularly seasonal and pandemic influenza. 3 These complications include acute necrotising encephalopathy (associated with mutations in the RANBP2 gene), acute infantile encephalopathy, and acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy and myelopathy in adults. 17 , 18 The estimated incidence of neurological disorders during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic was 1·2 per 100 000, with children affected more than adults. 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic has been associated with post-infectious encephalitis lethargica, although a causative link has not been proven. 23

## Projected epidemiology of COVID-19-associated neurological disease
Although neurological complications are rare in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the scale of the current pandemic means that even a small proportion could build up to a large number of cases. The minimum prevalence of CNS complications ranged from 0·04% for SARS to 0·20% for MERS, and PNS complications ranged from 0·05% for SARS to 0·16% for MERS, from which we have extrapolated the number of cases with neurological complications of COVID-19 ( table 1 ). Given the 4·8 million cases of COVID-19 globally, these prevalences project to a total of 1805–9671 patients with CNS complications and 2407–7737 with PNS complications. These numbers, which do not include the increasingly important syndromes of stroke-associated COVID-19 infection, will rise as the pandemic continues.

## Clinical features of COVID-19-associated neurological disease
As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, reports of neurological manifestations are increasing; to date, 901 patients have been reported. These manifestations can be considered as direct effects of the virus on the nervous system, para-infectious or post-infectious immune-mediated disease, and neurological complications of the systemic effects of COVID-19 ( appendix p 4 ). In one national registry of 125 patients with COVID-19 and neurological or psychiatric disease reported over a 3-week period, 25 39 (31%) patients had altered mental status, which included 16 (13%) with encephalopathy (of whom seven [6%] had encephalitis), and 23 (18%) with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis, including ten (8%) with psychosis, six (5%) with neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and four (3%) with an affective disorder. Notably, 77 (62%) patients had a cerebrovascular event: 57 (46%) ischaemic strokes, nine (7%) intracerebral haemorrhages, one (<1%) CNS vasculitis, and ten (8%) other cerebrovascular events. 25 The challenges in managing patients with a highly contagious infection, and the overwhelming number of cases, have meant that many early reports did not have sufficient detail, few included comprehensive description of CSF analysis, imaging, or follow-up, and they often appear on non-peer-reviewed websites. Most are not reported using standard case definitions ( panel ; appendix pp 5–12 ). In what follows, we review the CNS and PNS infectious and inflammatory complications that are well recognised for viral respiratory infections, followed by cerebrovascular disease, which is relatively unusual ( table 2 ).

Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain parenchyma, usually caused by an infection or the body's immune defences. Although it is strictly speaking a pathological diagnosis, for practical purposes, clinical evidence of brain inflammation is accepted, such as a CSF pleiocytosis, imaging changes, or focal abnormalities on EEG. Detection of virus in the CSF per se does not provide a diagnosis of encephalitis if there is no evidence of brain inflammation ( panel ; appendix p 6 ). 57

As of May 19, 2020, eight adults aged 24–78 years (median 62 [IQR 40–70]), including four women, have been described with encephalitis associated with COVID-19, mostly diagnosed through a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab ( table 2 ; appendix pp 13–14 ). 31 , 32 , 33 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 Neurological features mostly started from the time of respiratory symptom onset to 17 days afterwards, although in one man aged 60 years, confusion preceded cough and fever by two days ( figure 1 ). 58 Two patients had fever only, with no respiratory features. 59 , 60 The neurological manifestations were typical for encephalitis, with irritability, confusion, and reduced consciousness, sometimes associated with seizures; three patients also had neck stiffness 31 , 58 , 59 and another had psychotic symptoms. 61 A man aged 40 years developed ataxia, oscillopsia, hiccups, and bilateral facial weakness. 33 CSF analysis was reported for six patients; it showed a pleiocytosis in five, mostly lymphocytic, and was normal in one patient. Four patients had CSF PCR done for SARS-CoV-2, of whom one was positive: a man aged 24 years with encephalitis, minor respiratory symptoms, and ground glass changes on chest CT, who had a PCR negative respiratory sample. 31 Few publications reported comprehensive investigation for other causes of encephalitis ( table 2 ; appendix pp 13–14 ). Brain imaging was normal or had no acute changes for six patients, and showed high signal intensity in two, including temporal lobe changes in one ( figure 2A, B ); 31 the patient with ataxia had a cerebellar lesion that extended into the spinal cord. 33 EEG was done in five patients. 32 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 Two had generalised slowing, two had focal abnormalities, and one patient, who presented with psychotic symptoms followed by a seizure, was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus. 61 One patient responded quickly to high dose steroids, 58 but for the other seven no specific treatment was reported beyond anticonvulsants, antiviral, and antibiotic medication.

No specific treatment exists for SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis. As for other forms of encephalitis, questions will emerge concerning the relative contributions of viral damage and host inflammatory response, and whether corticosteroids might be useful. Clinical trials seem unlikely, given the current low number of cases.

Encephalopathy is a pathobiological process in the brain that usually develops over hours to days and can manifest as changed personality, behaviour, cognition, or consciousness (including clinical presentations of delirium or coma). 80 In patients with encephalopathy and COVID-19, in whom brain inflammation has not been proven, the wide range of other causes to consider includes hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangements ( appendix pp 2–3 ). 57

The largest study to date, 36 from Wuhan, China, retrospectively described 214 patients with COVID-19, of whom 53 (25%) had CNS symptoms, including dizziness (36 [17%] patients), headache (28 [13%]), and impaired consciousness (16 [7%]). 27 (51%) of the patients with CNS symptoms had severe respiratory disease, but there was little further detail ( table 2 ; appendix pp 14–15 ). 36 In a French series of 58 intensive care patients with COVID-19, 35 49 (84%) had neurological complications, including 40 (69%) with encephalopathy and 39 (67%) with corticospinal tract signs. MRI in 13 patients showed leptomeningeal enhancement for eight and acute ischaemic change for two; CSF examination for seven patients showed no pleiocytosis. 15 (33%) of 45 patients who had been discharged had a dysexecutive syndrome. Additionally, some case reports have appeared, including a woman with encephalopathy with imaging changes consistent with acute necrotising encephalopathy ( figure 2C, D ) 37 and a fatal case in which viral particles were found in endothelial cells and neural tissue, although there was no indication of whether this was associated with inflammation. 38

Several reports have described seizures in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Paroxysmal episodes consistent with seizures were described in two infants with no respiratory symptoms but SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab; 34 , 81 both made a good recovery. In one series of 168 children hospitalised with COVID-19, 82 seizures were described for five (3%) children, of whom three had pre-existing epilepsy and one had previous febrile seizures.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is a syndrome of multifocal demyelination, typically occurring weeks after an infection, which generally presents with focal neurological symptoms, often with encephalopathy ( appendix p 7 ). 83 Two case reports 40 , 41 describe middle-aged women with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and SARS-CoV-2 detected on respiratory swabs ( table 2 ; appendix p 16 ). One developed dysphagia, dysarthria, and encephalopathy 9 days after the onset of headache and myalgia ( figure 1 ). 41 The other presented with seizures and reduced consciousness, and required intubation for respiratory failure. 40 Both patients had normal CSF and high signal intensities on MRI, typical of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. They both improved after treatment, one with intravenous immunoglobulin and one with steroids. To date, a single report exists of myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord; appendix p 8 ) associated with COVID-19. A man aged 66 years in Wuhan, China, developed fever, fatigue, and then acute flaccid paraparesis with incontinence. Examination showed hyporeflexia and a sensory level at T10. He was treated with dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin, and was discharged for rehabilitation. 42

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and myelitis, usually considered post-infectious diseases, are treated typically with corticosteroids or other immunotherapies. In these para-infectious cases, with SARS-CoV-2 detectable at presentation, clinicians might need to be more cautious, especially if the virus is detected in the CSF, because such treatment might diminish the patient's immune response to the virus.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute polyradiculopathy characterised by rapidly progressive, symmetrical limb weakness, areflexia on examination, sensory symptoms, and, in some patients, facial weakness, although several variants exist ( appendix p 9 ). To date, 19 patients (six female) with Guillain-Barré syndrome or its variants and COVID-19 have been reported, with a median age of 63 years (range 23 to 77; table 2 ; appendix pp 16–18 ). Given the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, the incidence is not particularly higher than what might be expected. 84 Neurological symptoms started at a median of 7 days (range −7 to 24) after respiratory or systemic features ( figure 1 ), although two patients developed febrile illness 7 days after the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome; 45 , 68 on hospital admission, one had a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the other had lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, which are characteristic for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three patients had diarrhoea before the onset of neurological disease.

11 patients had Guillain-Barré syndrome with weakness of all four limbs with or without sensory loss, 43 , 44 , 45 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 three had a paraparetic variant with leg weakness only, 44 , 68 , 75 and one had lower limb paraesthesia. 44 Four of these patients had facial nerve involvement, five had dysphagia, and eight developed respiratory failure. Three had autonomic complications, one with hypertension and two with sphincter dysfunction. Electrophysiological studies were done in 12 patients and were consistent with demyelinating disease in eight and axonal disease in four patients.

Two patients had the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia; 46 , 47 one also had loss of smell and taste, and was positive for anti-GD1b-IgG. One patient had bilateral and one patient unilateral abducens palsy, 46 , 47 and another had an acute vestibular syndrome with horizontal nystagmus and oscillopsia. 48

For 16 patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a respiratory swab, and for two, the sample was not specified; one patient was also positive for rhinovirus. One patient was diagnosed by a blood antibody test. Lumbar puncture was done in 13 patients and showed albuminocytological dissociation in 11. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any CSF samples. Testing for other pathogens commonly associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported for only four patients. 43 , 44 , 73 , 75 15 patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, and eight (all with classical Guillain-Barré syndrome) were admitted to intensive care for ventilatory support, two of whom died. 70 , 71 12 improved, and five had ongoing disability at discharge.

Muscle injury associated with raised creatine kinase affected 23 (11%) of 214 patients in the Wuhan series. 57 Rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 has also been reported. 85 , 86

Loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) have emerged as common symptoms of COVID-19, either with other features or in isolation, suggesting that they might be useful diagnostic markers ( appendix p 19 ). 87 A study of 259 patients, 88 including 68 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, found that abnormal smell and taste were both strongly associated with COVID-19. In a European study, 50 olfactory dysfunction was reported for 357 (86%) of 417 COVID-19 patients; 342 (82%) reported gustatory disorders. These symptoms were reported more frequently for COVID-19 patients than for a historical cohort of influenza patients. 89 Subclinical deficits in smell, taste, or both have also been detected. 90 , 91 Although these symptoms can occur in any respiratory infection because of coryza, the fact they occur in isolation of other symptoms suggest that there is involvement of the olfactory nerve.

As COVID-19 has spread around the world, evidence has grown for an association with cerebrovascular disease, as well as with other forms of vascular disease. Cerebrovascular manifestations were reported for 13 (6%) of 221 COVID-19 patients in an early retrospective case series from Wuhan: 53 11 (5%) patients developed ischaemic stroke, one (<1%) had intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (<1%) had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. In Milan, Italy, nine (2%) of 388 retrospectively identified hospital patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had a stroke. 92 Another centre in Italy reported that 43 (77%) of 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients admitted to one neurology unit had cerebrovascular disease; 35 had ischaemic stroke and three haemorrhagic stroke, and five had transient ischaemic attacks. 93 In the Netherlands, three (2%) of 184 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 had ischaemic strokes. 94 In total, 88 patients with ischaemic stroke and eight with haemorrhagic stroke 53 , 54 , 56 , 77 , 93 have been reported, 18 (19%) of whom died ( table 2 ; appendix pp 20–23 ).

Most patients were older than 60 years, and many had known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, especially hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and vascular disease. 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 77 , 78 Younger stroke patients have also been reported. 52 , 55 , 56 , 92 , 95 In one hospital in New York, NY, USA, five patients younger than 50 years with stroke and SARS-CoV2 were admitted in just 2 weeks, whereas the average number of admissions for young patients with stroke per 2 weeks in the preceding year was 0·73. 55 Two patients had no other symptoms of COVID-19. All had large vessel ischaemic strokes.

Cerebrovascular symptoms began at a median of 10 days (range 0–33) after the onset of respiratory illness ( figure 1 ), although in one patient the stroke preceded respiratory features 36 and five had only cerebrovascular symptoms. 51 , 55 , 56 , 95

In two patients, ischaemic stroke has been associated with thrombus in the aorta, 95 , 96 and indeed multiple infarcts have been reported in these and other patients ( figure 2E, F ), 52 , 77 , 79 sometimes associated with arterial thrombosis and limb ischaemia. 77 , 79 Concurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been found in other stroke patients. 52 , 95 Arterial and venous imaging is clearly essential for COVID-19 patients with acute cerebrovascular events. Small asymptomatic infarcts identified on MRI only have also been described. 35 Blood D-dimer concentration was raised in many patients with COVID-19, consistent with a pro-inflammatory, coagulopathic state in the setting of critical illness. 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 77 , 92 , 95 , 96 Positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies have also been reported in COVID-19-associated stroke, 52 , 77 although these can be raised in other critical illnesses, including infections.

Immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin has been recommended for patients with COVID-19, to reduce the risk of thrombotic disease. 97 This approach might also reduce COVID-19-associated ischaemic stroke, but it must be balanced against the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic transformation of an acute infarct. Several randomised trials are looking at the role of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 ( NCT04362085 , NCT04345848 , NCT04406389 ), including the effect on stroke incidence.

## Disease mechanisms
As with other neurotropic viruses, key questions for SARS-CoV-2 infection concern the routes of entry into the nervous system and the relative contribution of viral infection versus host response to the subsequent damage ( appendix p 12 ).

Viral entry to the brain through the olfactory bulb—the only part of the CNS not protected by dura—is one plausible route for SARS-CoV-2, especially given the anosmia in COVID-19. This entry route is thought to be used by the herpes simplex virus, the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis. 98 In mouse models, following intranasal injection, human coronavirus OC43 invades the CNS by the olfactory route. 99 Alternative entry routes include carriage across the blood–brain barrier, following viraemia, or through infected leukocytes. 3 The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, to which SARS-CoV-2 binds for entry into cells, 100 is found in brain vascular endothelium and smooth muscle. 101 SARS-CoV-2 replicates in neuronal cells in vitro. 102

Damage within the CNS or PNS might be caused directly by the virus or by the body's innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Data so far do not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 or related coronaviruses are highly neurovirulent, unlike herpes simplex virus, some enteroviruses, and some arthropod-borne viruses, which can cause rampant destruction of neurons. 98

Autopsy material from a patient who developed encephalopathy weeks after presenting with SARS showed oedema, neuronal necrosis, and broad gliocyte hyperplasia. 8 Immunohistochemical staining showed that SARS-CoV in the brain was associated with elevated expression of the cytokine, monokine induced by gamma interferon (known as MIG or CXCL9), and with infiltration of monocytes and macrophages plus T cells. These findings are consistent with viral CNS entry triggering the infiltration of immune cells and the release of cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to tissue damage.

Little work has been done on disease mechanisms for coronavirus PNS disease. By comparison with other viruses, it would not be surprising to see immune-mediated disease, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, and direct anterior horn cell viral damage, which causes acute flaccid myelitis, might also be expected. 103

Early indicators suggest that cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 might be due to a coagulopathy. SARS-CoV-2 can cause damage to endothelial cells, activating inflammatory and thrombotic pathways. 104 Endothelial cell infection or monocyte activation, upregulation of tissue factors, and the release of microparticles, which activate the thrombotic pathway and cause microangiopathy, might occur for SARS-CoV-2 as for other viruses. 105 , 106 Monocyte activation is postulated to constitute part of the secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis described in severe COVID-19. 107 Thrombocytopenia with elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein in severe COVID-19 and stroke are consistent with a virus-associated microangiopathic process. 53 Endothelial dysfunction can potentially lead to microvascular and macrovascular complications in the brain, as described systemically. 94

Acute ischaemic stroke might also occur through the early inflammatory process, following acute infection, destabilising a carotid plaque or triggering atrial fibrillation. 108 A vasculitis process similar to that for varicella zoster virus, in which viral replication in the cerebral arterial wall triggers local inflammation, 109 is also plausible; endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 with inflammation and apoptosis of endothelial cells has been shown in kidney, heart, bowel, and lung at autopsy, 104 but cerebral vessels have not yet been investigated.

## Investigating for neurological disease
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and patients with neurological symptoms are seen increasingly, it is essential that the desire to publish quickly is balanced with the need for careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies. Clinicians must adopt a methodical approach to investigating patients with possible COVID-19-associated neurological disease, and must systematically consider the evidence for viral infection and the presenting clinical diagnosis, using definitions that distinguish confirmed, probable, and possible cases ( panel ; appendix pp 5–12 ).

Given that SARS-CoV-2 causes a large number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections, it is crucial to remember that patients with neurological disease from other causes might be infected coincidentally with the virus, including in hospital through nosocomial transmission. A full investigation, which is absent in many reports to date, is needed to rule out other established causes of brain infections before attributing disease to COVID-19. 57 , 110 Distinguishing between nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 infection and nervous system infection is also key.

For patients with altered consciousness or agitation, all causes of encephalopathy must be considered, including hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangement; encephalitis should be diagnosed only if clinical evidence exists of brain inflammation, such as a CSF pleiocytosis, imaging changes, focal seizures, or histological changes ( appendix p 6 ). 57 Even if virus is detected in the CSF, encephalitis should not be diagnosed unless evidence exists of brain inflammation. For patients with possible peripheral nerve disease, clinicians should aim to do CSF examination, looking for evidence of albuminocytological dissociation (an elevated CSF protein level with a normal CSF cell count), nerve conduction studies, and electromyography during recovery, even if they cannot be done acutely.

In patients with neuropathy, cerebrovascular disease, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, in whom the damage is probably caused by the host's response to viral infection, establishing causality is even more challenging, especially if patients present after the virus has been cleared from the nasopharynx. Clinical case definitions for COVID-19 that are based on the history and typical findings for chest imaging and blood investigations will be useful ( panel ). For patients with stroke, clinicians should consider cerebral angiography, intracranial vessel wall imaging, and, if necessary, brain biopsy, looking for vasculitis. The apparently high incidence of cerebrovascular disease in patients with COVID-19, with predominantly large vessel disease and markers of a highly prothrombotic state, suggest a causal relationship. However, the high prevalence of the virus during the pandemic, and the fact that most stroke patients have other risk factors, mean that it is hard to be sure about causation. The link with SARS-CoV-2 will ultimately need to be proven by careful case-control studies.

In investigating patients with limb weakness and sensory change, it is crucial to distinguish between disease of the peripheral nerves (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) and inflammation of the spinal cord, which can present with flaccid paralysis if the anterior horn cells are involved. 103 CSF examination, neurophysiological studies, and spinal imaging are essential.

For patients on intensive care, determining whether neuropathy, myopathy, encephalopathy, or cerebrovascular disease are non-specific manifestations of critical illness or are specific to the virus itself might be particularly challenging; no reliable markers exist for neurological disease caused by critical illness, although it tends to occur after several weeks. 10 Up to 70% of patients with sepsis might develop encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. 111 In the Wuhan series, neurological complications were more common in those with severe disease, suggesting that some of the neurological manifestations were related to critical illness. 36 , 112

## Conclusion and future directions
Given existing knowledge of other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses, the wide range of CNS and PNS associations with COVID-19 is not surprising, and this is the focus of most current reports. However, neurological disease is also likely to be seen increasingly in patients who are SARS-CoV-2-positive but with few or no typical features of COVID-19, based on knowledge of other epidemic viral infections and cases reported so far. 28 Case-control studies will be needed to help establish whether SARS-CoV-2 is causal or coincidental in such patients. Hypercoagulable states and cerebrovascular disease, which have been seen rarely for some acute viral infections, are an important neurological complication of COVID-19.

Overall, the proportion of patients with neurological manifestations is small compared with that with respiratory disease. However, the continuing pandemic, and the expectation that 50–80% of the world's population might be infected before herd immunity develops, suggest that the overall number of patients with neurological disease could become large. Neurological complications, particularly encephalitis and stroke, can cause lifelong disability, with associated long-term care needs and potentially large health, social, and economic costs. Health-care planners and policy makers need to be aware of the growing burden.

Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the neurological disease manifestations and burden. This work will involve the collaboration of a range of clinical and research expertise, and harmonised approaches across regions; smaller case series and registries should be combined into meta-analyses such as that of the COVID-19 Neuro Network run through Brain Infections Global, which is also providing standardised case record forms and case definitions.
