# Title
Dietary salt promotes cognitive impairment through tau phosphorylation

# Abstract
Dietary habits and vascular risk factors promote both Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment caused by vascular factors 1 – 3 . Furthermore, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule associated protein and a hallmark of Alzheimer’s pathology 4 , is also linked to vascular cognitive impairment 5 , 6 . In mice, a salt-rich diet leads to cognitive dysfunction associated with a nitric oxide deficit in cerebral endothelial cells and cerebral hypoperfusion 7 . Here we report that dietary salt induces tau hyperphosphorylation followed by cognitive dysfunction, effects prevented by restoring endothelial nitric oxide production. The nitric oxide deficiency reduces neuronal calpain nitrosylation resulting in enzyme activation, which, in turn, leads to tau phosphorylation by activating cyclin dependent kinase-5. Salt-induced cognitive impairment is not observed in tau-null mice or in mice treated with anti-tau antibodies, despite persistent cerebral hypoperfusion and neurovascular dysfunction. These findings unveil a causal link between dietary salt, endothelial dysfunction and tau pathology, independent of hemodynamic insufficiency. Avoiding excessive salt intake and maintaining vascular health may help stave off vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies underlying late-life dementia.

## METHODS
Most of the methods used in this study are well established in the laboratory and have been described in detail in previous publications 7 , 20 , 34 . Here we provide only a brief description.

All procedures are approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Weill Cornell Medicine (Animal protocol number: 0807–777A). Studies were conducted, according to the ARRIVE guidelines ( https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines ), in the following lines of mice: C57BL/6 (JAX), B6.129X1-Mapttm1Hnd (Tau −/− , JAX, Stock #007251), B6.129P2-Nos3 tm1Unc /J (eNOS −/− , JAX, Stock #002684), B6.129S4- Nos1 tm1Plh /J (nNOS −/− , JAX, Stock #002986), 129S6.Cg-Tg(APPSWE)2576Kha N20+? (Taconic, Stock #279), and Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay Fgf14 Tg(tetO-MAPT*P301L)4510Kha /J (rTg4510, JAX, Stock#024854). Unless otherwise indicated, 8 week-old male mice were used.

Male or female mice (8 weeks old) received normal chow (0.5% NaCl) and tap water ad libitum (normal diet) or sodium-rich chow (4–8% NaCl) and tap water containing 1% NaCl ad libitum (HSD) for 4 to 36 weeks according to the experiment 7 .

The nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine (10gr/L; Sigma) was administered in the drinking water starting at 8 weeks of HSD and continuing until 12 weeks. ND and HSD mice were treated (i.p., weekly) with 50mg/kg of anti-Tau (HJ8.8), mouse IgG1 isotype control (Clone MOPC-21; bioXcell) antibodies for the last 4 weeks of the HSD treatment period (12 weeks) prior to behavioral and cerebrovascular studies. HJ8.8 is a high affinity antibody generated against human tau but able to recognize both human and mouse tau (KD=0.926 nM to mouse tau). In other experiments, ND and HSD mice were treated (i.p. twice/week) with 40mg/Kg of TPF5 (KEAFWDRCLSVINLMSSKMLQINAYARAARRAARR) or scrambled peptide (GGGFWDRCLSGKGKMSSKGGGINAYARAARRAARR) (Peptide 2.0) 35 for the last 4 weeks of the HSD treatment period (12 weeks) prior to behavioral and molecular studies.

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction, 5%; maintenance, 2%). The trachea was intubated and mice were artificially ventilated with a mixture of N 2 and O 2 . One of the femoral arteries was cannulated for recording mean arterial pressure (MAP) and collecting blood samples for blood gas analysis 36 . Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C. End tidal CO 2 , monitored by a CO 2 analyzer (Capstar-100, CWE Inc.), was maintained at 2.6–2.7% to provide a pCO 2 of 30–40 mmHg and a pH of 7.3–7.437. After surgery, isoflurane was discontinued and anesthesia was maintained with urethane (750 mg/kg, i.p.) and chloralose (50 mg/kg, i.p.). Throughout the experiment the level of anesthesia was monitored by testing motor responses to tail pinch.

A small craniotomy (2×2mm) was performed to expose the parietal cortex, the dura was removed, and the site was superfused with Ringer’s solution (37°C; pH 7.3–7.4) 20 . CBF was continuously monitored at the site of superfusion with a laser-Doppler probe (Perimed) positioned stereotaxically ≈0.5mm above the cortical surface and connected to a data acquisition system (PowerLab). CBF values are expressed as percentage increases relative to the resting level.

After MAP and blood gases stabilized, CBF responses were recorded 7 . The whisker-barrel cortex was activated for 60 seconds by stroking the contralateral vibrissae, and the evoked changes in CBF were recorded. The endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh; 100μM; Sigma), was superfused on the exposed neocortex for 5 minutes and the associated CBF changes were recorded by laser-Doppler flowmetry. CBF and MAP data were collected by using Chart 5 Pro (v5.5.6).

CBF was assessed quantitatively using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI), performed on a 7.0 Tesla 70/30 Bruker Biospec small-animal MRI system with 450 mT/m gradient amplitude and a 4500 T · m−1 · s−1 slew rate. A volume coil was used for transmission and a surface coil for reception. Anatomical localizer images were acquired to find the transversal slice approximately corresponding to bregma 0.5 mm. This position was used for subsequent ASL-MRI, which was based on a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (FAIR-RARE) pulse sequence labeling the inflowing blood by global inversion of the equilibrium magnetization. One axial slice was acquired with a field of view of 15 × 15 mm, spatial resolution of 0.117 × 0.117 × 1 mm, TE of 5.368 ms, effective TE of 48.32 ms, recovery time of 10 s, and a RARE factor of 72. Twenty-two turbo inversion recovery values ranging from 30 to 2300 ms were used, and the inversion slab thickness was 4 mm. For computation of resting CBF (rCBF), the Bruker ASL perfusion processing macro was used. It uses the model of Kober et al. 37 and includes steps to mask out the background. The masked rCBF images were exported to Analyze format on the MRI console. The ASL images were analyzed by ImageJ and the average CBF value is reported as mL per 100g of tissue per minute 7 .

Osmotic minipumps containing vehicle (saline) or angiotensin-II (600 ng·kg−1·min−1) were implanted subcutaneously under isoflurane anesthesia. Systolic blood pressure was monitored in awake mice using tail-cuff plethysmography 20 . Forty-two days later, mice were anesthetized and their brains were collected for assessment of tau phosphorylation.

C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks old) were anesthetized by injection of ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg). Rectal temperature was continuously monitored and kept at 37°C (normothermia) or 30°C (hypothermia) using a thermostatically-controlled heating pad. Mice were sacrificed 30 minutes after anesthesia and their brains were collected and frozen on dry ice. Tissues were kept at −80°C until processing for immunoblot analysis.

Cortex (≈80–90mg) and hippocampus (≈15mg) isolated from ND and HSD mice were sonicated in 800 and 500μl of RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Deoxycholic Acid, 0.1% SDS, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1mM Na3VO4, 20mM NaF and one tablet/10mL of cOmplete™, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Millipore Sigma) and equal volumes were mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on 10% or 10–20% Novex™ WedgeWell™ gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), blocked at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour with 5% milk in TBS, and incubated, overnight at 4°C, with primary antibodies (see Reporting Summary) in 5% BSA in TBS/0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Membranes were washed in TBST, incubated with goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at RT and protein bands were visualized with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio Rad) on a Bio Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System. Quantification was performed using Image Lab v6.0 (Bio Rad).

After homogenization in cold RIPA buffer and centrifugation, 150μl of the supernatant containing the proteins was boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes. Samples were cooled on ice for 20 minutes and then centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant corresponding to the heat stable (HS) fraction was then harvested. This method is used to isolate proteins resistant to heat including tau and other microtubule-associated proteins. Thus, endogenous immunoglobulins are precipitated during the boiling process and eliminated from the supernatant. The proteins were then mixed with equal volumes of SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on 10% Novex™ WedgeWell™ gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Although tau protein is partially lost during the boiling process, the HS samples are enriched with tau ( Extended Data Fig. 5h ). Furthermore, boiling significantly improves specificity of certain antibodies such as AT8, RZ3 or MC1 38 .

After overnight dialysis to remove phosphatase inhibitors, protein samples (40μl) were incubated with 5μL of 10X NEBuffer for Protein MetalloPhosphatases (PMP), 5μL of 10mM MnCl 2 and 1μl of Lambda Protein Phosphatase (Lambda PP, New England Biolabs) at 30°C for 3 hours. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 minutes at 100 °C.

Extraction was performed as described previously 32 . The cortex (≈80–90mg) and the hippocampus (≈15mg) of each brain were homogenized by sonication in 800 and 300μl of RAB buffer [100mM MES, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM MgSO 4 , 750mM NaCl, 20mM NaF, 1mM Na3VO4, supplemented by EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Millipore Sigma], respectively. In brief, the samples were centrifuged at 50,000g for 20 minutes at 4°C using an Optima MAX-TLA 120.2 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The supernatants were collected as RAB soluble fractions and pellets were resuspended in identical volumes of RIPA buffer [150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 25mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 20mM NaF, 1mM Na 3 VO 4 supplemented by EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Millipore Sigma], and centrifuged at 50,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were collected as RIPA soluble fractions. The pellets were sonicated in 70% formic acid (300μl for the cortex and 125μl for the hippocampus), and centrifuged at 50,000g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were collected as 70% formic acid fractions. All fractions were stored in −80°C until analyzed. For western blotting, an aliquot of 100μl of the formic acid fractions was evaporated in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator at 45°C for 1 hour. The samples were resuspended in 100μl of SDS sample buffer with the addition of 1μl of 10N NaOH, sonicated and then boiled for 5 minutes.

Tau, Aβ and IL-17 were measured using an electrochemiluminescence-based multi-array method through the Quickplex SQ 120 system (Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC). Tau and Aβ peptides levels (Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42) were measured in RAB, RIPA and FA fractions of both cortex and hippocampus using the MSD Mouse Total Tau (K151DSD) and the MSD V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (4G8) (K15199) kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol. IL-17A was measured in the serum of ND and HSD mice using the MSD V-PLEX Mouse IL-17A Kit (K152RFD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

After 12 weeks of ND/HSD, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg), and then perfused transcardiacally with cold PBS, followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The brains were removed and immersed first in 4% PFA overnight and then in 70% ethanol for 3 days. Brains were then embedded in paraffin and cut into 6μm sections using a microtome. After rehydration and antigen retrieval in preheated citrate buffer (10μM) for 30 minutes, brain sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 and then blocked with 100% Sniper (Biocare Medical) for 1 hour. After blocking, sections were incubated for 2.5 days at 4°C with the AT8, MC1 (1:250, 1:100 in 1:50 Sniper in PBS, respectively) and thereafter processed for 1 hour with the biotinylated secondary antibody in 1% normal donkey serum PBS (anti-mouse IgG1, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Reactions were visualized with the ABC-complex (Vectorlabs) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine. A Nikon light microscope was used to visualize the signal associated with each antibody.

After 12 weeks of ND/HSD, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg), and then perfused transcardiacally with cold PBS, followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The brains were removed and immersed first in 4% PFA overnight. Sections (thickness: 40 μm) were cut through the whole brain using a vibratome. After blocking with 5% normal donkey serum in 0.5% Triton-X/PBS, sections were incubated over the weekend at 4°C with NeuN (1:200, Mouse, Millipore Sigma, MAB377) GFAP (1:200, Mouse, Millipore Sigma, G3893), Iba1 (1:200, Rabbit, Wako, 019–19741), CD13 (1:200, Goat, R&D Systems, AF2335), Calpain 2 (1:100, Rabbit, Santa Cruz, sc-373966) or Cdk5 (1:100, Rabbit, Santa Cruz, sc-6247) antibodies in 0.5% Triton-X in PBS and thereafter processed for 2 hours with FITC, Cy3 or Cy5 secondary antibodies in 0.5% Triton-X in PBS. An epifluorescence microscope (IX83 Inverted Microscope, Olympus) or a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5) were used to visualize the signal associated with each antibody.

After rehydration, brain sections (6μm) were immersed in 1% sodium hydroxide in 80% alcohol for 5 min, followed by 2 min in 70% alcohol and 2 min in distilled water. The slides were transferred to a solution of 0.06% potassium permanganate for 10 min on a shaker. After rinsing for 2 min in distilled water, the slides were immersed in the staining solution (0.0004% Fluro Jade B, Millipore Sigma, in 0.1% acetic acid) for 20 min in the dark. Finally, the slides were rinsed three times for one min in distilled water and then placed on a slide warmer, set at approximately 50°C, until they were fully dry. The dry slides were cleared by immersion in xylene for at least a min before cover-slipping with DPX (Sigma).

After rehydration and antigen retrieval according to the manufacturer’s protocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Roche, #11 684 795 910), brain sections were blocked for 30 min in Tris-HCl, 0.1 M pH 7.5, containing 3% BSA and 20% normal donkey serum and then incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. After washing, slides were evaluated by an epifluorescence microscope (IX83 Inverted Microscope, Olympus). A positive control was obtained by pre-incubating brain slices with DNase I recombinant (3000 U/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA), for 10 min at room temperature, to induce DNA strand breaks.

The Klüver-Barrera stain was performed using the Luxol Fast Blue Stain Kit (ScyTek Laboratory Inc.). Brains were harvested after transcardiac perfusion with PBS and 4% PFA, sectioned with a vibratome (thickness 40 μm), and the positive (blue stained) area in the corpus callosum was quantified by ImageJ.

After mounting on slides and post-fixation with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 minutes, coronal brain sections (40μm) were washed and labeled with 0.05% (wt/vol) thioflavine-S in 50% (vol/vol) ethanol for 10 minutes as previously described 39 . An epifluorescence microscope (IX83 Inverted Microscope, Olympus) was used to visualize the FITC signal associated with thioflavine-S.

Calpain activity was measured by using a Calpain Activity Assay Kit from AbCam 40 , 41 . Briefly, fresh cortex and hippocampus were homogenized in the extraction buffer provided with the kit, which specifically extracts cytosolic proteins without contaminations of cell membrane and lysosome proteases and prevents auto-activation of calpain during the extraction procedure. The fluorometric assay is based on the detection of cleavage of calpain substrate Ac-LLY-AFC. Ac-LLY-AFC emits blue light (ʎmax = 400nm); upon cleavage of the substrate by calpain, free AFC emits a yellow-green fluorescence (ʎmax = 505nm), which can be quantified using a fluorometer or a fluorescence plate reader. Specificity of the signal was confirmed by using the calpain inhibitor Z-LLY-FMK (100–200μM). The activity is expressed as Relative Fluorescent Unit (RFU) per milligram of protein for each sample.

Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-p35p25 (Cell Signaling), anti-GSK3β (Cell Signaling) or anti-rabbit monoclonal IgG1 isotype control antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies and then with protein-A sepharose (p35p25) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or protein-G Dynabeads (GSK3β) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hours at 4° C. Precipitates were used for Cdk5 or GSK3β activity measurements. Immunoprecipitation was confirmed by loading the samples on 10% Tris-glycine SDS polyacrylamide gels and western blot as described above.

Detection of S-nitrosylated calpain 2 was performed using the biotin-switch technique, as previously described 42 . Briefly, samples were sonicated in 800μl of RIPA buffer containing 0.1mM of neocuproine and, after centrifugation, protein concentrations were measured. Cysteine thiol groups in 1mg of proteins were blocked with 10% S-methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) (Sigma). After protein-precipitation with 100% acetone, sodium ascorbate was added to the sample to convert each S-nitrothiols (SNO) to a free thiol via a transnitrosation reaction to generate O-nitrosoascorbate. Next, each nascent free thiol (previously an SNO site) was biotinylated with biotin–HPDP (Pierce). Biotinylated proteins were then pull-down by using avidin beads and analyzed on 10% Novex™ WedgeWell™ gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before avidin pulldown, a small fraction of each sample was collected to determine protein “input.” The degree of pulldown correlates with protein S-nitrosylation of calpain 2 or Cdk5 which was detected with an antibody against the two proteins (see Extended Data Suppl. Table 1). Nitrosylation of calpain 2 or Cdk5 is expressed as the ratio between the pull-down signal and the input corrected for the β-actin levels.

Cdk5 activity in brain lysates was determined after pulldown with p25/p35 antibody (Cell Signaling) from 500μg total protein using a synthetic histone H1 peptide substrate (PKTPKKAKKL, Enzo Life Sciences). GSK3β activity was determined after pulldown with GSK3β antibody (Cell Signaling) from 100μg total protein using phospho-glycogen synthase peptide-2a as substrate (Tocris). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by mixing bead-coupled Cdk5 with 40μl reaction buffer containing the following: 50mM HEPES.KOH (pH 7.4), 5mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% BSA, 50μM substrate, 50μM cold ATP, 1mM dithiothreitol, 1x complete protease inhibitors without EDTA (Roche Applied Biosciences) and 5 Ci/mmole γ32P-ATP. Companion reactions for every sample were executed in the presence of the Cdk5 inhibitor ((R)-CR8, Tocris) (10μM) or the GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR 99021, Tocris) (10μM) to correct for non-specific activity. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes, after which they were terminated by spotting on P81 phosphocellulose cation exchange chromatography paper. Filters were washed 4 times for 2 minutes in 0.5% phosphoric acid, and the remaining radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter by the Cherenkov method.

The novel object recognition test (NOR) task was conducted under dim light in a plastic box. Stimuli consisted of plastic objects that varied in color and shape but had similar size 43 , 44 . A video camera mounted on the wall directly above the box was used to record the testing session for offline analysis. Mice were acclimated to the testing room and chamber for one day prior to testing. Twenty-four hours after habituation, mice were placed in the same box in the presence of two identical sample objects and were allowed to explore for 5 minutes. After an intersession interval of 24 hours, mice were placed in the same box but one of the two objects was replaced by a novel object. Mice were allowed to explore for 5 minutes. Exploratory behavior was later assessed manually by an experimenter blinded to the treatment group. Exploration of an object was defined as the mouse sniffing the object or touching the object while looking at it. Placing the forepaws on the objects was considered as exploratory behavior but climbing on the objects was not. A minimal exploration time for both objects (total exploration time) during the test phase (~5 seconds) was used. The amount of time taken to explore the novel object was expressed as percentage of the total exploration time and provides an index of recognition memory 43 , 44 . Any Maze v5.3 was used for collection and analysis of the behavioral data.

The Barnes maze consisted of a circular open surface (90cm in diameter) elevated to 90cm by four wooden legs 45 . There were 20 circular holes (5cm in diameter) equally spaced around the perimeter, and positioned 2.5cm from the edge of the maze. No wall and no intra-maze visual cues were placed around the edge. A wooden plastic escape box (11×6×5cm) was positioned beneath one of the holes. Two neon lamps and a buzzer were used as aversive stimuli. The Any-Maze tracking system (Stoelting) was used to record the movement of mice on the maze. Extra-maze visual cues consisted of objects within the room (table, computer, sink, door, etc.) and the experimenter. Mice were tested in groups of seven to ten, and between trials they were placed into cages, which were placed in a dark room adjacent to the test room for the inter-trial interval (20–30 minutes). No habituation trial was performed. The acquisition phase consisted of 3 consecutive training days with three trials per day with the escape hole located at the same location across trials and days. On each trial a mouse was placed into a start tube located in the center of the maze, the start tube was raised, and the buzzer was turned on until the mouse entered the escape hole. After each trial, mice remained in the escape box for 60 seconds before being returned to their cage. Between trials the maze floor was cleaned with 10% ethanol in water to minimize olfactory cues. For each trial mice were given 3 minutes to locate the escape hole, after which they were guided to the escape hole or placed directly into the escape box if they failed to enter the escape hole. Four parameters of learning performance were recorded: (1) the latency to locate (primary latency) and (2) enter the escape hole (total latency), (3) the number of errors made and (4) the distance traveled before locating the escape hole45. When a mouse dipped its head into a hole that did not provide escape was considered an error. On days 4 and 5, the location of the escape hole was moved 180° from its previous location (reverse learning) and two trials per day were performed. Any Maze v5.3 was used for collection and analysis of the behavioral data.

Sample size was determined according to power analysis based on previously published work by our lab on the effects of dietary salt on CBF regulation and cognitive function 7 . On these bases, 10–15 mice/group were required in studies involving assessment of cognitive function and cerebrovascular function 7 , 20 . Mouse randomization for the different experimental conditions and treatments was performed based on the random number generator function (RANDBETWEEN) in Microsoft Excel software. Analysis of the data was performed in a blinded fashion using the GraphPad Prism (v. 7.0) software. All data was tested for normal distribution by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Intergroup differences were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test for single comparison or by one or two-way analysis of variance (Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis) for multiple comparisons. Non-normally distributed data was tested with the Mann-Whitney U test for single comparison or the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons. Data are expressed as mean±SEM and differences are considered statistically significant for p<0.05.

a, Administration of L-arginine (10 g/L in drinking water), starting at week 8 of HSD and continued through week 12, suppresses RZ3 levels in neocortex but not in hippocampus (CTX: RZ3, ND/HSD n=10/10, *p<0.0001 vs ND Veh; HIPP: RZ3, ND/HSD n=10/10, *p=0.0005 vs ND Veh, two-tailed unpaired t-test). b, L-arginine does not affect the increase in serum IL-17 induced by HSD (Veh, ND/HSD n=9/11, *p=0.0002 vs ND Veh; L-Arg, ND/HSD n=9/8, *p<0.0001 vs ND L-Arg, two-tailed unpaired t-test). c, AT8 and RZ3 levels are elevated in the neocortex and the hippocampus of eNOS −/− mice on ND (AT8: CTX, ND/HSD n=5/4, *p=0.0029 vs WT; HIPP, ND/HSD n=5/4, *p=0.0078 vs WT; RZ3: CTX, ND/HSD n=5/4, *p=0.0003 vs WT; HIPP, ND/HSD n=5/4, *p=0.0128 vs WT, two-tailed unpaired t-test). d, HSD does not increase tau phosphorylation in eNOS −/− mice (RZ3: HIPP, ND/HSD n=7/8, *p=0.0224 vs ND, two-tailed unpaired t-test). e, Calpain 2 immunoreactivity is present in neuronal cell bodies of the somatosensory and the piriform cortex (size bar=500 μm; 100μm in inset).

RZ3 levels are not altered by HJ8.8. f, Administration of HJ8.8 antibody does alter the increase of IL-17 serum levels induced by HSD (IgG: ND/HSD n=9/9, *p=0.0192 vs ND IgG; HJ8.8: ND/HSD n=7/5, *p=0.0421 vs ND HJ8.8, two-tailed unpaired t-test). g, The CBF increase in somatosensory cortex induced by neural activity evoked by mechanical stimulation of the whiskers is not reduced by HSD in WT, tau −/− and mice treated with the anti-tau antibody HJ8.8, WT ND/HSD n=5/7, Tau −/− ND/HSD n=9/8; IgG ND/HSD n=5/5, HJ8.8 ND/HSD n=5/5. h, Western blotting showing enrichment of tau in boiled RIPA neocortical samples (heat stable fraction, HS). Notice that β-actin is lost during the boiling process. Representative images from n=3 experiments. i, Cartoon depicting the mechanisms by which HSD leads to tau phosphorylation and cognitive impairment. HSD elicits a Th17 response in the small intestine, which leads to an increase in circulating IL17. IL17, in turn suppresses endothelial NO production by inducing inhibitory phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495. The NO deficit results in reduced calpain nitrosylation in neurons, increased calpain activity, p35 to p25 cleavage, activation of Cdk5, and tau phosphorylation, which is ultimately responsible for cognitive dysfunction. In support of this chain of events, rescuing the endothelial NO deficit with L-arginine (L-Arg), lack of tau in tau-null mice, treatment with Cdk5 peptide inhibitor TFP5 or antibodies directed against tau (Tau Ab) prevent the cognitive dysfunction.
