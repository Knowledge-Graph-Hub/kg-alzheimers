C9orf72suppresses systemic and neural inflammation induced by gut bacteria

# Abstract
A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C90RF72 is the most common genetic variant contributing to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 1 , 2 . The C90RF72 mutation acts through gain and loss of function mechanisms to induce pathways implicated in neural degeneration 3 – 9 . The expansion is transcribed into a long repetitive RNA, which negatively sequesters RNA binding proteins 5 prior to its non-canonical translation into neural-toxic di-peptide proteins 3 , 4 . Failure of RNA-polymerase to read through the mutation also reduces abundance of the endogenous C90RF72 gene product, which functions in endo-lysosomal pathways and suppresses systemic and neural inflammation 6 – 9 . Notably, effects of the repeat expansion act with incomplete penetrance in ALS/FTD families, indicating that either genetic or environmental factors modify each individual’s risk of disease. Identifying disease modifiers is of significant translational interest, as it could suggest strategies that diminish the risk of developing ALS/FTD, or that slow progression. Here, we report that an environment with reduced abundance of immune-stimulating bacteria 10 , 11 protects C9orf72 mutant mice from premature mortality and significantly ameliorates their underlying systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. Consistent with C9orf72 functioning to prevent microbiota from inducing a pathological inflammatory response, we found that reducing microbial burden in mutants with broad spectrum antibiotics, as well as transplanting gut microflora from a protective environment attenuated inflammatory phenotypes, even after their onset. Our studies provide further evidence that the microbial constituency of our gut plays an important role in brain health and can interact in surprising ways with well-known genetic risk factors for nervous system disorders.

## Antibiotics prevent inflammation
We next considered variables between the two environments that might have contributed to such dramatic differences in the severity of mutant phenotypes. We found that diet, light-cycle and many other features of the two environments were similar. However, a review of microbial screening reports from the two facilities indicated that murine norovirus (P = 0.0140), Helicobacter spp. (P < 0.0001), Pasteurella pneumotropica (P = 0.0070) and Tritrichomonas muris (P < 0.0001) were significantly more common in C9orf72 Harvard animals than in C9orf72 Broad mice ( Supplementary Table 1 ). It is important to note, that differences between the two colonies were well within norms for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) processes. The differential components of the microflora we found at Harvard are not generally considered pathogenic, consistent with the normal health and lifespan of control animals in that environment ( Fig. 1b and ref 7 ). However, Helicobacter spp. have been suggested to have immune-stimulating properties 10 , raising the possibility that changes in gut microflora between the environments might underlie the increased rate of mortality and inflammatory phenotypes we found in C9orf72 Harvard mutant animals.

To learn whether resident microflora contributed to the inflammation and autoimmunity seen in C9orf72 Harvard mutants, we weaned new C9orf72 Harvard animals (+/+ n=14, −/− n=22) and administered either vehicle or broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to onset of inflammatory disease (Day 30), then monitored related phenotypes for 200 days ( Fig. 2a ). As expected, antibiotics significantly reduced the abundance and diversity of bacterial species including Helicobacter spp ., without affecting levels of murine norovirus. The guts of vehicle treated controls were largely unaltered ( Fig. 2b and Extended data Fig 3a ). We found that vehicle had no effect on development of either inflammatory or autoimmune phenotypes in C9orf72 Harvard −/− mice, including cytokine storm ( Extended Data Fig. 3b ), neutrophilia ( Fig. 2c ), pseudothrombocytopenia ( Fig. 2d ), autoimmunity ( Fig. 2e ) and splenomegaly ( Fig. 2f and Extended data Fig 3c ). In contrast, providing lifelong antibiotics treatment to C9orf72 Harvard −/− mice completely suppressed the emergence of all of these phenotypes ( Fig. 2c – f and Extended data Fig 3b – i ). Thus, our experiments suggest that signals derived from gut bacteria promote inflammation and autoimmunity when C9orf72 function is diminished. However, we found that chronic antibiotics administration resulted in previously reported health consequences including hepatoxicity 17 , which prevented us from assessing behavioral and survival outcomes.

We next asked whether acute suppression of gut microbiota could ameliorate inflammatory and autoimmune phenotypes after their establishment in C9orf72 Harvard mutant mice. To this end, we obtained another independent cohort of C9orf72 Harvard mice (+/+ n=25, −/− n=24; Day 250), demonstrated these animals displayed the expected inflammatory phenotypes relative to controls and showed that they exhibited poor performance on the accelerating rotarod ( Fig. 3a – d and Extended Data Fig 4a ). Then we began acute administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitored associated phenotypes over the course of 60 days. We found that this treatment significantly reduced each of the inflammatory and autoimmune phenotypes in mutant animals ( Fig 3b – d ), including splenomegaly (P = 0.0002) ( Extended Data Fig. 4c – d ) and improved rotarod performance (P = 0.0398) ( Extended Data Fig 4a ). In contrast, treatment with vehicle had no impact on these measures ( Fig 3b – d and Extended Data Fig 4a – d ).

## Fecal transplants mitigate inflammation
To more directly probe whether phenotypic improvements were due to microbial communities of the gut, rather than unrelated consequences of antibiotics treatment, we performed fecal transplant experiments. We produced another cohort of C9orf72 Harvard mice (+/+ n=27, −/− n=32; Day 100) and demonstrated these animals displayed the expected inflammatory phenotypes relative to controls. We then suppressed these animals’ gut microflora with transient antibiotic treatment and transplanted with feces from either the pro-inflammatory (Harvard BRI) or pro-survival (Broad Institute) environment ( Fig 3e ). Transplantation of pro-survival gut microflora significantly improved each of the inflammatory and autoimmune phenotypes ( Fig 3f – h and Extended Data Fig 4e ). In contrast, transplant with microflora from the pro-inflammatory facility did not improve these measures, suggesting the benefits we observed when transplanting feces from the protective environment was not merely due to the brief antibiotic treatment that enabled microbial engraftment. Therefore, our studies establish that the inflammatory and autoimmune disease which underlies premature mortality in C9orf72 Harvard mutant mice can be therapeutically prevented and that signals from certain gut microbiota help to maintain it.

## Profiling gut bacteria
To identify bacterial constituents of the gut associated with severe phenotypes in C9orf72 Harvard mutant mice, we surveyed the composition of feces from two pro-inflammatory environments where mutant mice perished 7 , 12 as well as two pro-survival environments 6 , this report ( Fig 3i ). Principle components analysis readily separated samples from the four environments with the largest principle component (PC1; 28.7% of variance), separating the two pro-inflammatory environments from the two pro-survival environments ( Fig 3j ). Deeper investigation of this axis of variance revealed a shared significant decrease in alpha diversity in the two pro-inflammatory environments while unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated that samples from the pro-inflammatory environments showed disparate beta diversity from that in pro-survival environments ( Fig 3k and Extended data Fig 9f ). Exemplifying these considerable differences in community structure, 62 of 301 bacterial species we identified (20.6%) were significantly altered in their abundance when jointly comparing the two pro-survival environments to the two pro-inflammatory environments (p < 0.0002)( Extended Data Fig 5a – e ). Consistent with initial observation ( Supplementary Table 1 ), Helicobacter spp. was found in both pro-inflammatory environments ( Extended data Fig 5g – h and Supplementary Images ) but absent in pro-survival environments.

We next characterized the extent of microbial reconstitution in our fecal transplant recipients ( Extended data Fig 6a – f ). Hierarchical clustering of beta diversity revealed that the microbial constituencies of mice receiving Broad transplants were more similar to Broad Institute feces than to feces from either animals housed at Harvard BRI or feces from Harvard transplant recipients ( Extended data Fig 6d ). Analysis of individual bacteria similarly supported the success of our transplants, with 85% (199/234) of bacterial species identified in Harvard BRI feces detected in Harvard fecal recipients and 75% (178/236) of bacterial species identified in Broad Institute feces detected in Broad fecal recipients ( Extended Data Fig 6f ). Quantitative PCR for Helicobacter spp. rDNA further confirmed the reconstitution of Harvard specific microbes in Harvard recipients and their elimination from Broad fecal recipients ( Extended data Fig 5i and Supplementary Images ).

## Gut components regulate myeloid cytokines
To mechanistically explore how varied fecal components in separate environments alter cytokine burden and autoimmunity in C9orf72 −/− mice, we stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from C9orf72 Harvard animals with chemical analogs of microbial components and found that both +/− and −/− C9orf72 Harvard BMDMs released higher levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines than +/+ control cells in response to bacterial lipopeptide, single stranded (ss)RNA and ssDNA ( Extended data Fig 7a – c ). Given these findings, we next asked whether fecal material from Harvard BRI housed animals contained higher levels of innate immune stimulating factors than feces from mice at the Broad Institute. To this end, we individually administered normalized concentrations of fecal eubacteria from both institutions to C9orf72 Harvard −/− and +/+ BMDMs. Indeed, we found that C9orf72 −/− BMDMs produced significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha when exposed to Harvard BRI fecal material than when exposed to Broad feces ( Extended data Fig 7d ). In addition, serial dilutions revealed that a combination of Harvard BRI feces and a C9orf72 −/− genotype lead to TNF-alpha release at the lowest fecal concentrations ( Extended data Fig 7d ).

## Environment governs neuroinflammation
Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of C90RF72 ALS and FTD 18 , 19 , with substantial infiltration of peripheral immune cells noted in the spinal cord of ALS patients 20 , 21 . We used the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 to distinguish CD45 mid resident microglia from peripherally derived CD45 hi cells 22 and found that infiltrating cells were present at sites of focal inflammation within the spinal cord parenchyma of C9orf72 Harvard −/− mice ( Figure 4a and Extended data Fig 8a – h and Supplementary Videos 1 – 2 ). Mass Cytometry analysis revealed the CD45 hi cells that infiltrated the spinal cord were mostly CD11b + Ly6C + Ly6G + CD39 − neutrophils and CD3e + T cells ( Extended Data Fig. 8a – f and Supplementary Gating Strategy ). Strikingly, lifelong suppression of gut microflora with antibiotics prevented the accumulation of infiltrating myeloid cells within the spinal cord of C9orf72 Harvard −/− mice ( Figure 4b – c ).

In addition to infiltrating peripheral immune cells, there are also substantial changes to resident microglia in the nervous system of ALS/FTD patients 23 . Studies from our group 24 and others 6 , 8 , 9 have implicated C9orf72 and its interactor Smcr8 in regulation of endo-lysosomal trafficking and autophagy, particularly in myeloid derivatives. We found that microglia from the spinal cord of C9orf72 Harvard −/− animals expressed higher levels of the lysosome-associated proteins Lamp1 6 ( Extended data Fig 9a and Supplementary Videos 3 – 4 ) and Cathepsin B ( Extended data Fig 9b and Supplementary Videos 5 – 6 ). Lifelong suppression of gut microbiota did not significantly decrease Lamp1 or Cathepsin B levels in C9orf72 Harvard −/− microglia ( Extended data Fig 9c – d ) suggesting that C9orf72 function regulates lysosomal constituents independently from microbial signals.

To examine the activation status of resident microglia in C9orf72 Harvard mutant animals and to also ask whether it might be altered by signals from the microbiota, we measured levels of the pattern recognition receptor Dectin1, the chemokine receptor Ccr9, and the lipoprotein lipase Lpl which have previously been associated with pro-inflammatory microglial states 25 – 27 . Consistent with the notion that microglia become activated when C9orf72 levels decline, we found that Dectin1 and Ccr9 were enriched on microglia from C9orf72 Harvard −/− mice ( Fig 4d – f and Extended data Fig 9e – g and Supplementary Videos 7 – 8 ). Importantly, Dectin1 and Ccr9 expression were significantly reduced in microglia from C9orf72 Harvard mutant animals whose gut microflora was chronically suppressed with antibiotics ( Fig 4d – f ). Together these results demonstrate that when C9orf72 function is reduced, peripheral immune cells can infiltrate the spinal cord where they associate with sites of neuroinflammation and that treatment with antibiotics, which suppresses the microbiota, modulates both infiltration and microglial activation.

## Discussion
Our results indicate that when C9orf72 function declines, the environment generally and the gut microbiota specifically become potent modifiers of whether autoimmunity, neural inflammation, motor deficits and premature mortality occur. In fact, the effect of environment and accompanying changes of microbial microflora are so strong in this mouse model that in one environment, inflammatory disease and death were highly penetrant phenotypes, while in another they were essentially absent. We therefore provide the likely explanation for the considerable phenotypic variation that has been observed across groups studying this C9orf72 LOF allele in mice 6 , 7 , 12 , 13 . Our conclusions are important because they re-emphasize that the 50% reduction in the levels of C90RF72 found in C90RF72 ALS/FTD patients are a credible cause for the neural inflammation that are characteristic in their condition. Most provocatively, our findings also suggest that variance in microbiota could explain why some carriers of the C90RF72 mutation develop ALS/FTD or overt inflammatory conditions like lupus 15 , 16 , while others do not.

It should be re-emphasized that the microbes present in the environments we studied here are not considered mouse pathogens per se, and that their abundances were within the scope found in comparable institutions 28 . Importantly, the environmental conditions that triggered severe phenotypes in our C9orf72 Harvard animals were reproducible elsewhere. Others 12 reported a relationship between reduction in C9orf72 function and an increased rate of premature mortality comparable to that we described previously 7 and replicated here. It is notable that these two environments were most similar in their microbial constituents and also shared many microbes that were not present in the two pro-survival locations we surveyed. Given the large number of species we found to significantly differ in their abundance between pro-inflammatory and pro-survival environments, future studies will be needed to elucidate the relative contribution of individual bacterial species to variation in the inflammatory and autoimmune phenotypes we reported herein. However, microbe by microbe analysis of varying environments and our transplant animals would seem to rule out reported protective effects of Akkermansia muciniphila 29 , 30 ( Extended data Fig 6f ) and potential inflammatory influences of Tritrichomonas muris ( Extended data Fig 5e ).

It is increasingly appreciated that gut microbes alter the maturation and function of microglia 31 , can influence the activity of neurons in the central nervous system 32 and contribute to neuroinflammation and neuropathology in models of Alzheimer’s 33 and Parkinson’s disease 34 . However, only initial surveys of the gut microbiota have been reported in patients with neurological conditions 35 and thus far results from initial studies in ALS patients have been mixed 36 , 37 . One study reported significant differences between the microbial constituencies of ALS/FTD patients and controls 36 while another found no clear distinctions 37 . Given the genetic heterogeneity exhibited within ALS patients, it is perhaps not surprising that early studies have failed to reach consensus.

Consistent with the idea there are complex interactions between a patient’s germline genotype and their gut microflora in ALS, it was recently reported that SOD1 transgenic mice displayed a more rapid decline when bacterial load was reduced, which was linked to reduced bacterial production of nicotinamide 29 . While we cannot rule out the presence of protective microbes in some environments, our studies suggest that lowering bacterial load in C9orf72 mutants was in aggregate protective, likely by reducing exposure of their genetically sensitized innate immune response to microbially-derived inflammatory factors. In sum, our studies suggests that the microbiome may be an important governor of onset and progression in patients with C90RF72 mutations, including those experiencing autoimmune and inflammatory conditions prior to an ALS/FTD diagnosis 15 , 16 . To test this idea, a key future experiment will be to identify C90RF72 repeat expansion carriers within known families and to determine whether the gut microbiota differs between individuals that remain healthy and those acquiring ALS/FTD.
