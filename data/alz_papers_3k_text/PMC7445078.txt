## Methods
Samples were acquired through the Stanford Brain Rejuvenation Program, the NIA funded Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), the University of California at San Francisco ADRC and the University of California at San Diego ADRC. Collection of brain tissue, plasma, PBMCs and CSF was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each university, and written consent was obtained from all subjects. A total of 164 living subjects from three separate cohorts (cohorts 1, 2 and 4) were used in this study. The 164 subjects included 97 healthy individuals, 31 patients with MCI, 28 patients with AD and 8 patients with PD. The average age of subjects was 72.52 ± 6.96 (mean ± s.d.) for healthy individuals; 70.97 ± 7.82 for patients with MCI; 70.74 ± 7.01 for patients with AD; and 67.25 ± 7.01 for patients with PD. The average cognitive score was 27.17 ± 2.32 for healthy individuals; 23.39 ± 4.31 for patients with MCI; 11.05 ± 7.32 for patients with AD; and 27.29 ± 1.70 for patients with PD. All subjects were free from acute infectious diseases and in good physical condition. Patients were confirmed to have neuro-degeneration by measurement of biomarkers including neurofilament, Aβ and tau (Quanterix). Group characteristics, including demographic, genetic, clinical and biomarker data for each group, are presented in Supplementary Table 12 .

PBMCs were isolated from blood by layering diluted blood (1:1 in PBS) on top of an equal volume of Ficoll, followed by centrifugation and isolation of the buffy coat. CSF was collected by lumbar puncture, then centrifuged at 300g to pellet immune cells. CSF samples were checked for blood contamination by resuspending the pelleted cells in 100 μl CSF and mixing 10 μl (10%) CSF with 10 μl trypan blue to assess red blood cell content and viability. Cells were visualized on a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad) and cell viability and the presence or absence of red blood cells was recorded. CSF samples that were contaminated with blood were not used in the study. The resuspended cells were then mixed with 900 μl recovery cell culture freezing medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were frozen overnight at −80 °C in a Mr. Frosty freezing container (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred the following day to liquid nitrogen for storage. PBMC samples were stored over the course of a three-year period. The average PBMC viability for patient samples following sample thawing was 79%, and that for control samples was 77%. CSF samples were stored less than 6 months before analysis.

Study subjects underwent a battery of neuropsychological assessments to determine group status, including cognitive examination, evaluation of cerebellar function, deep tendon reflexes, sensory input and motor function. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 21 examination was used to test study subjects for cognitive impairment. The MoCA assesses several cognitive domains: short-term memory recall (5 points), visuospatial abilities (4), executive functions (4), attention (1), concentration (3), working memory (1), language (6) and orientation to time and space (6). MoCA scores range between 0 and 30.

T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired using an Axial 3D fast spoiled gradient sequence (GE Discovery 750). The imaging parameters were optimized for grey and white matter tissue contrast with a repetition time of 5.9 ms, echo time 2 ms, flip angle 15°, field of view 220 mm, matrix size 256 × 256, slice thickness 1 mm and 2 NEX. Image analysis was conducted using FreeSurfer 6.0. For subcortical segmentation, we used the ‘recon-all’ command. For hippocampal segmentation, we appended the flag ‘-hippocampal-subfields-T1’ to the ‘recon-all’ command for each patient. To correct for sex differences, we normalized all volumetric measurements to the total intracranial volume for each patient.

Flow cytometry was conducted using an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). A panel consisting of antibodies conjugated to six different fluorophores was used to classify subsets of memory T cells and for drop-seq. Antibodies used were: CD8α-Pacific blue (BioLegend), CD3-BV650 (BD Biosciences), CD45RA-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend), CCR7–488 (Bio-Legend), IL-7Rα-PE (BioLegend) and CD27-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend). For characterization of CSF cells, this same panel was used, but CD19-PE-Cy5 (BioLegend) and CD14-Qdot-705 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were included. For sorting CSF T cells for TCR plate-seq, the following antibodies were used: CD8α-PE (BioLegend), CD161-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend), CXCR3-APC (BioLegend), CD4-APC-Alexa700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), CD39-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend), CD38-FITC (BioLegend), PD-1-BV421 (BD Biosciences), CD45RA-BV605 (BD Biosciences), CD3-BV650 (BD Biosciences), CD27-BV786 (BD Biosciences) and CD127-BUV395 (BD Biosciences). For each experiment, a compensation matrix was developed using singly stained and unstained controls or fluorescent beads, and all analysis was conducted in Cytobank.

PBMCs were thawed and plated at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells per well in a 24-well plate. The medium consisted of RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C with 20 U ml −1 IL-2, cells were stimulated with a cocktail containing PMA, ionomycin and brefeldin A (BioLegend). Cells were then incubated an additional 5 h before performing intracellular flow cytometry analysis.

Mass cytometry was performed as previously described 22 . In brief, cells were thawed in complete medium containing RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.1 mg ml −1 DNase. After washing in Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm) cells were resus-pended in 50 μl filtered antibody cocktail (Fluidigm) and incubated for 60 min on ice. Cells were again rinsed, then resuspended in 100 μl of 1:3,000-diluted In115-DOTA maleimide in buffer. Following additional rinses, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde in buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed twice with permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) and incubated on ice for 45 min. After rinsing, cells were resuspended in Ir-Interchelator in buffer and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with buffer, then MilliQ water and finally resuspended in MilliQ water for running on a Helios mass cytometer. To normalize mass cytometry data, the same lot of EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) was used for all experiments to control for signal variation that may have occurred in the instrument over time. Normalization of mass cytometry data was achieved using the Matlab bead normalization tool.

SPADE and CITRUS analyses were conducted using Cytobank. For SPADE conducted on mass cytometry data, we established a target number of nodes of 100 for our immunophenotyping assay. We based this number on empirical evaluation of results from multiple runs on the same dataset, which showed comparable results. The SPADE population for immunophenotyping (live CD45 + cells) was selected on the basis of the gating strategy shown in Extended Data Fig. 3 . Cells were clustered on all markers except those used to exclude platelets or endothelial cells. For CITRUS, the same population of cells and same clustering channels were used as in SPADE to quantify the abundance of various populations. Results are from 5 × 103 events per sample, with a false discovery rate of 2%, minimum cluster size of 1% and cross validation folds set to 10. The predictive nearest shrunken centroid PAMR association model was used. To avoid spurious results, we ran CITRUS with minimum cluster sizes of 1–4%, cross validation folds 5–10 and false discovery rate 1–5% for 1 × 10 4 , 1.5 × 10 4 and 2 × 10 5 events, totalling 17 individual runs. For SPADE conducted on flow cytometry data, CD3 + CD8 + cells were gated and clustered with a target number of nodes of 30.

Paraffin-embedded brain tissues were sectioned at 5-μm thickness. Deparaffinization was achieved by washing slides through a series of xylenes and decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Tissue sections were then subjected to antigen retrieval using citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 95 °C for 30 min. Following rinsing with PBS, sections were incubated in blocking buffer containing PBS with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.03% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were rinsed with PBS then incubated in appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were then rinsed and stained with Hoechst DNA dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before being coverslipped with ProLong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies included rat anti-human CD3 (Abcam), rabbit anti-human CD8α (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-Aβ (Cell Signaling), chicken anti-human MAP2 (Abcam), mouse anti-human granzyme-A (Abcam), rat anti-mouse CD8a (eBioscience) and rabbit anti-mouse NEFH (Abcam). For mouse Aβ plaque staining, ThioflavinS (1 mg ml −1 , 1:625, Sigma) was added to the secondary antibody solution.

For human tissue, the LSM880 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) was used to acquire images using 40× and 63× objectives. For mouse tissue imaging, the LSM700 and LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscopes (Zeiss) were used, which were provided by the microscopy core facility of the Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg (SCI-TReCS). For all Z-stacks, images were acquired using optical sectioning then combined into maximum intensity projections. 3D reconstructions were performed using Imaris v.9.1.2 (Bitplane).

For quantification of human CD3 + CD8 + and GZMA + CD8 + T cells, homologous sections of the hippocampal dentate gyrus were cut at 10-μm thickness using a microtome (Leica Biosystems). Plot sampling was conducted by using CA3 as a boundary to draw a rectangular area of approximately 2 mm 2 that encompassed the molecular layer, granule cell layer and hilus. Three separate sections were sampled using a 20× objective. CD3 + CD8 + T cells were then manually counted by a blinded observer in ZEN 2 Blue Edition (Zeiss).

APP/PS1 mice 23 , 24 expressing a chimaeric mouse/human mutant amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) directed to CNS neurons under the prion protein promoter were used (TheJackson Laboratory). Mice were housed at the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg in groups under standard conditions at a temperature of 22 °C and a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard food and water. Over 10 mice aged 12–13 months comprising both sexes were randomly analysed in an unblinded manner. Animal care, handling, genotyping and experiments were approved by Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg ethical committees.

For ultrastructure analysis, 12–13-month-old APP/PS1 mice and wild-type controls were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were removed and 50-μm sagittal sections were cut using a vibratome (Leica) and stored in 0.1 M PB with 0.05% sodium azide. Sections with brain areas of interest were selected and pre-embedding 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB)-immunostaining was performed as described previously 25 , 26 . Rat anti-CD8 (eBioscience) primary antibody was used and incubated for 2 days at 4 °C. After several washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 2 days with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibody (Vector) at 4°C. To increase staining signal, sections were incubated in the Vectastain ABC Hrp Kit (Vector) for 1 h. After rinsing three times in PBS, sections were transferred to DAB using the Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector). Sections were rigorously washed and osmificated by incubating in 1% OsO4 (EMS) in 0.1 M PB for 1 h. Following 3 washes for 10 min in distilled water, sections were incubated in Uranyl Acetate Replacement Stain-UAR (EMS) for 30 min. Sections were dehydrated by incubation in an increasing series of ethanol and transferred to propylenoxide (EMS) before embedding in araldite durcupan (four component resin, Sigma) overnight in aluminium foil cups at room temperature. The following day, slices were transferred to acetate slides (100 micron colour laser printer film, 5 Star Office Supplies), covered with small amounts of araldite, coated with a second acetate slide and hardened in an oven at 60 °C for 3 days. Hippocampal and cortical regions with CD8 + T cells were identified using light microscopy and regions of interest were cut out of embedded sections. One side of the acetate slide was removed and samples were glued onto an araldite durcupan block with cyanoacrylate adhesive (UHU). This protocol was performed with small modifications according to previously reported protocols 27 , 28 . After removing the acetate slides and careful trimming of the samples into a trapezial shape, semi-thin sections of 1–1.5 μm were generated using an Ultracut Reichert E (Leica). Semi-thin sections were transferred to object slides and were stained with 1% Toluidine blue for orientation. After identification of stained cells, ultra-thin sections of 70 nm were directly cut using a diamond knife (Diatome). Sections were stretched with chloroform and subsequently collected with 50 or 75 mesh copper grids of 3 mm diameter coated with 0.2% Formvar solution. Grids were dried and analysed with a LEO 912 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an in-column energy filter, at 100 kV by using a Slow Scan Dual Speed CCD camera TRS Sharpeye (Troendle). The imaging software used was Image SP v.1.2.7.31 (SIS, Soft Image System).

TCR sequencing was conducted according to our previously established protocols 5 , 29 . In brief, TCR sequences from live CD3 + single cells were obtained by a series of three nested PCR reactions. For all phases of PCR reactions, HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) was used. The phase 1 PCR reaction was a multiplexed PCR with multiple Vα, Vβ, Cα and Cβ region primers in a 16-μl reaction. For the phase 1 PCR reaction, the final concentration of each TCR V-region primer was 0.06 μM and each C-region primer was 0.3 μM. A PCR reaction was done using the following conditions: 95 °C 15 min; 94 °C 30 s, 62 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min × 16 cycles; 72 °C 10 min; 4 °C. Thereafter, a 1-μl aliquot of the phase 1 product was used as a template for the 12-μl phase 2 PCR reaction. The following cycling conditions were used for phase 2 PCR: 95 °C 15 min; 94 °C 30 s, 64 °C 1 min, 72°C 1 min × 25 cycles; 72 °C 5 min; 4 °C. For the phase 2 reaction, multiple internally nested TCRVα, TCRVβ, TCRCα and Cβ primers were used (V primers 0.6 μM, C primers 0.3 μM). The phase 2 primers of TCR V-region contained a common 23-base sequence at the 5’ end to enable amplification during the phase 3 reaction with a common 23-base primer. A 1-μl aliquot of the phase 2 PCR product was used as a template for the 14-μl phase 3 PCR reaction, which incorporated barcodes and enabled sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. For the phase 3 PCR reaction, amplification was performed using a 5’ barcoding primer (0.05 μM) containing the common 23-base sequence and a 3’ barcoding primer (0.05 μM) containing the sequence of a third internally nested Cα and/or Cβ primer, and Illumina Paired-End primers (0.5 μM each). The following cycling conditions were used for phase 3 PCR: 95 °C 15 min; 94 °C 30 s, 66 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min × 25 cycles; 72 °C 5 min; 4 °C. The final phase 3 bar-coding PCR reactions for TCRα and TCRβ were done separately. For the phase 3 reaction, 0.5 μM of the 3’ Cα barcoding primer and the 3’ Cβ barcoding primer were used. In addition to the common 23-base sequence at the 3’ end (that enables amplification of products from the second reaction) and a common 23-base sequence at the 5’ end (that enables amplification with Illumina Paired-End primers), each 5’ barcoding primer contains a unique 5-base barcode that specifies plate and a unique 5-base barcode that specifies row within the plate. These 5’ barcoding primers were added with a multichannel pipette to each of 12 wells within a row within a plate. In addition to the internally nested TCR C-region sequence and a common 23-base sequence at the 3’ end (that enables amplification with Illumina Paired-End primers), each 3’ barcoding primer contained a unique 5-nucleotide barcode that specified column. These 3’ barcoding primers were added with a multichannel pipette to each of eight wells within a column within all plates. After the phase 3 PCR reaction, each PCR product should have had a unique set of barcodes incorporated that specified plate, row and column and had Illumina Paired-End sequences that enabled sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The PCR products were combined at equal proportion by volume and run on a 1.2% agarose gel, and a band around 350 to 380 bp was excised and gel purified using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). This purified product was then sequenced.

TCR sequencing data were analysed as previously described 5 , 29 . Raw sequencing data were processed and demultiplexed using a custom software pipeline to separate reads from every well in every plate as per specified barcodes. All paired ends were assembled by finding a consensus of at least 100 bases in the middle of the read. The resulting paired-end reads were then assigned to wells according to barcode. Primer dimers were filtered out by establishing a minimum length of 100 bases for each amplicon. A consensus sequence was obtained for each TCR gene. Because multiple TCR genes might be present in each well, our software establishes a cut-off of >95% sequence identity within a given well. All sequences exceeding 95% sequence identity are assumed to derive from the same TCR gene and a consensus sequence is determined. The 95% cut-off conservatively ensures that all sequences derived from the same transcript are properly assigned.

For CD8 + T EMRA scRNA-seq, base call files from a HiSeq 4000 Sequencer (Illumina) were generated by the Stanford Genomics Core. For CSF and peripheral CD8 + T EMRA scRNA-seq, FASTQ files from a Novoseq S4 sequencer were generated by Novogene. For CSF scTCR-seq, base call files from a NextSeq550 Sequencer (Illumina) were generated in-house. Single cell V(D)J and 5’ gene-expression analysis (10X Genomics) was used for peripheral CD8 + T EMRA and CSF cells. Cell Ranger v.3.0.2 was used to generate gene-expression matrices for both peripheral TEMRA and CSF cells. The Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline generated FASTQ files for both the 5’ expression library and the V(D)J libraries. Reads from the 10X v.2 5’ paired library were mapped to the human genome build GRCh38 3.0.0. Reads from the 10X V(D)J kit were mapped to the vdj-GRCh38 alts ensemble 2.0.0 (available from 10X Genomics). The 5’ gene-expression libraries were then analysed with the Cell Ranger count pipeline and the resulting expression matrix was used for further analysis in the Seurat package v.3.0. The V(D)J FASTQ files were analysed with the Cell Ranger vdj pipeline, which produced single cell V(D)J sequences and determined clonotypes. Clonotypes were determined by grouping of cell barcodes that shared the same set of productive CDR3 nucleotide sequences. The sequences of all contigs from all cells within a clonotype were then assembled to produce a clonotype consensus sequence. Clonality was integrated into the Seurat gene-expression analysis by adding clonality information to the metadata.

Individual sample expression matrices were loaded into R using the function Read10x under the Matrix package v.1.2–15. The expression matrix for each sample was merged into one Seurat object using the CreateSeuratObject and MergeSeurat functions. The Seurat package v.3.0 30 , 31 was used for filtering, variable gene selection, normalization, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering and visualization. For CD8 + T EMRA cells, genes were excluded if they were expressed in fewer than 10 cells, and cells were excluded if they expressed fewer than 200 genes. Cells that expressed more than 2,500 genes, more than 10,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and more than 10% mitochondrial genes were excluded. Regularized negative binomial regression using the sctransform normalization method was used to normalize, scale, select variable genes and regress out experimental batch, mitochondrial mapping percentage and the number of UMIs. After filtering and normalization, there were 15,330 genes across 18,203 cells. Following principal component analysis (PCA), 10 principle components were selected for clustering the cells. A resolution of 0.4 was used with t -SNE visualization. For CSF cells, genes were excluded if they were expressed in fewer than 10 cells and cells were excluded if they expressed fewer than 200 genes. Cells that expressed more than 1,800 genes, more than 7,500 UMIs and more than 10% mitochondrial genes were excluded from the analysis. The sctransform normalization method was used to normalize, scale, select variable genes and regress out sequencing and experimental batch, mitochondrial mapping percentage and the number of UMIs. After filtering and normalization, there were 212,267 samples and 14,734 features. Following PCA, four principle components were selected for clustering. A resolution of 0.3 was used with t -SNE visualization.

For differential expression analysis, markers for each cluster were determined by comparing the cells of each cluster to all other cells using the FindMarkers function in Seurat with the MAST algorithm from the R package MAST (v.1.8.2). For all comparisons between groups and clusters, only genes expressed by at least 10% of cells were included. The R package ggplot2 (v.3.1.0) was used to plot the results of differential expression analyses, showing the average log-transformed fold change of each gene and the -log10 of the adjusted P value (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Seurat was used to produce violin plots of the expression of selected genes. For pathway analysis, Panther was used to perform Reactome pathway analysis with genes that were identified from differential expression analysis ( q < 0.05) and with all genes in the dataset as background. Fisher’s exact test was used with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Z -scores for each pathway were calculated using the R package GOPlot.

To determine whether TCR sequences identified in our scTCR-seq experiments on peripheral T EMRA and CSF cells had known antigen specificity, the CDR3b region of each β chain was compared to the CDR3b repertoire from the VDJdb at https://vdjdb.cdr3.net/ .

For CSF cells sequenced by plate-seq, analysis of clonality was performed using Excel. TCRs with two or more identical CDR3b regions and CDR3a regions were defined as clonal. R was used to calculate a proportion of the sum of reads of the clonotypes to the overall number of reads in a repertoire (∑ reads of top clonotypes)/(∑ reads for all clonotypes). For TCRs sequenced using single-cell V(D)J technology (10X Genomics), clonality was determined by the Cell Ranger vdj pipeline as previously described. Clonotypes were determined from grouping of cell barcodes that shared the same set of productive CDR3 nucleotide sequences.

The sequences of all contigs from all cells within a clonotype were then assembled to produce a clonotype consensus sequence. Clonality was integrated into the Seurat gene-expression analysis by adding clonality information to the metadata. For TCR network analysis, to depict connections between diagnosis groups, patients and clonotypes, we used the qgraph package for R. Only TCRs with full α and β chain sequences were included in the analysis. Unweighted networks were generated with all subjects and split per diagnosis group.

The two TCRs identified from patients with AD by GLIPH were cloned into a pHR vector using the signal peptides of the TCR variable genes and full-length, unmodified constant regions from IMGT/V-QUEST. Packaging vectors pMD2G and pPAX were used to allow for human mammalian tropism and viral generation. Lentivirus was generated for each TCRα and TCRβ separately in Lenti-X 293T cells (Takara). Cells were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and viruses were collected at 48 h, filtered with 0.45-mM syringe filters (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and frozen at −80 °C or used immediately to infect the TCR-deficient SKW-3 cell line (Creative Bioarray; these cells were verified to lack TCRs using an antibody against TCRαβ and confirmed negative for mycoplasma contamination). TCRαβ 1 expressed TCRα: CAASEGGFKTIF and TCRβ: CASSLGTGNNEQFF. TCRαβ 2 expressed TCRa: CAADRT GGGNKLTF and TCRβ: CASSLAGGYNEQFF. Combined TCRα and TCRβ viruses were used to infect 2 × 10 6 SKW-3 cells at a multiplicity of infection of five by spinning for 1 h at 2,500 rpm at 32 °C, and cells were then placed back in culture. After 48 h, cells were collected, rinsed with PBS then incubated with live/dead near infrared dead cell dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific), stained for TCRαβ (IP26, BioLegend) and sorted on a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD). TCRαβ + cells were sorted before each experiment and cultures were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1× penicillin−streptomycin supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (20 IU ml −1 ; R&D Systems).

For αCD2/CD3/CD28 TCR stimulation, anti-biotin particles loaded with the biotinylated antibodies were used to mimic antigen-presenting cells and activate TCRs. Transduced SKW-3 cells were incubated with biotinylated antibodies against human CD2, CD3 and CD28 (Miltenyi) in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. Data were analysed using Cytobank and samples were gated on SKW-3 cells by forward and side scatter before analysis for TCRαβ and CD69 expression.

T cell lines were co-cultured with autologous fibroblasts in a 2:1 ratio during antigen presentation. For MCH-I peptide pool stimulation, a mix of 80 known MHC-I antigenic peptides (CEFX Ultra SuperStim Pool MHC-I Subset; JPT Peptides) were used to screen for reactive TCRs. Fibroblasts were plated at 5 × 10 4 cells per well in 24-well plates. The peptide mix contained 0.3–1.2 μg per peptide per μ1 (dependent on each peptide’s molecular weight) dissolved in DMSO and had a purity of each peptide of greater than 70% as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Peptide pools were added to fibroblast plates at 1:100 dilution in 250 μl medium. Control wells contained DMSO only. For individual peptide stimulations, peptides were produced at a purity of greater than 90% as determined by HPLC (JPT Peptides). Following 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, fibroblasts were heat-shocked at 41 °C for 30 min to increase antigen presentation. Fibroblasts were then rinsed with PBS and 1 × 10 5 cells from each T cell line were added in medium containing purified no azide/low endotoxin mouse anti-human CD28 antibody (2 μg ml −1 ; BD Biosciences) and IL-2 (20 IU ml −1 ). After 18 h, cells were analysed for activation by flow cytometry for TCRαβ and CD69 expression.

All statistical analyses were performed using commercially available software (Prism, SPSS or Excel). All values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Differences in means between two groups were analysed using unpaired two-sided heteroscedastic f-tests with Welch’s correction, unless otherwise noted. For regression analyses, the significance of the difference between two datasets was measured by ANCOVA. Differences in means among multiple datasets were analysed using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When ANOVA showed significant differences, pair-wise comparisons between means were tested by Sidak’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For scRNA-seq analyses, we corrected for multiple comparisons and report adjusted P values using Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For pathway analyses, Fisher’s exact test was used with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

A gating strategy was used to identify populations of immune cells by mass cytometry.

a , Normalization of mass cytometry data was performed before all analyses. A gating strategy for input into downstream analyses is shown. Live, single leukocytes were selected for analysis. b , Plotting of clusters by P value and fold change of each cluster reveals cluster 63 as the most highly increased cluster among patients with MCI or AD.

a , The top individual clones in AD were assessed by combining scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq datasets. A MAST differential expression test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction was conducted to compare CD8 + T cell maximum clones ( n = 12–18 cells) from patients with MCI or AD against all CSF T cells. Note the colocalization ofAD clones with CD8 + clusters on the t -SNE plots. b , Separate analysis of patients with MCI, AD and PD by percentages of maximum clones revealed an enrichment of highly expanded clones (defined as comprising 3% or more of all TCRαβ sequences; indicated by dotted line) in patients with these diseases. Only one out of ten healthy subjects had a highly expanded clone in their CSF, versus four out of six patients with AD, two out of six patients with PD and one out of five patients with MCI. c , Quantification of overall clonality (defined as the percentage of total TCRαβ sequences that are identical to one or more TCRαβ sequences) in the four groups of cohort 4.
