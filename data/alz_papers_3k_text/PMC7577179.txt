Negative feedback control of neuronal activity by microglia

# Abstract
Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, help to regulate brain function by removing dying neurons, pruning non-functional synapses, and producing ligands that support neuronal survival 1 . Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A 1 R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease.

## Methods
Mice w ere housed two to five animals per cage with a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on from 0700 to 1900 hours) at constant temperature (23°C) and humidity (~50%) with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal protocols were approved by IACUC at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines.

For brain-wide microglia ablation, adult C57/Bl6 wild type mice (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 000664) between 8-16 weeks of age were treated with CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622 44 (1200ppm chow, Plexxikon, Berkeley, CA), or control chow (same formula lacking only the inhibitor; Plexxikon, Berkeley, CA) for 3 weeks or 3 days as indicated. While a 3-week long PLX5622 treatment leads to a 99% microglia loss, around 80% of microglia are already lost after 3 days 44 .

For all pharmacological seizure experiments (those not involving genetic models), adult male C57/Bl6 wild type mice (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 000664) between 8-16 weeks of age were used.

To generate mice allowing for forebrain projection neuron-specific DREADD-mediated activation or inactivation , we bred transgenic CaMKII-tTa mice 45 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 003010) to transgenic TetO-CHRM3 mice 46 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 014093) or transgenic TetO-CHRM4 mice 46 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 024114). We then bred these DREADD mice to our microglia-specific TRAP ( Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ; Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ , both are knock-in lines to the endogenous locus ) mice 25 , 47 , 48 , resulting in CaMKII-tTa;TetO-CHRM3;Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ (CHRM3) mice, CaMKII-tTa;TetO-CHRM4; Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice (CHRM4) and control Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ; Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice. To activate Tamoxifen-inducible CreErt2, all mice were gavaged at 4-6 weeks of age with five doses of 100 mg/kg of Tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in corn oil (C8267, Sigma) with a separation of at least 48 hours between doses. For immunofluorescence, behavior, and gene expression, we induced neuronal excitation by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.25 mg/kg clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and induced neuronal inhibition by i.p. injection of 1.0 mg/kg CNO 2 hours prior to tissue dissection.

To generate mice with forebrain and/or striatum neuron-specific conditional ablation of Il34 , conditional Il34 fl/fl mice 49 in which exons 3-5 were targeted for deletion, were bred to transgenic Nestin Cre/+ mice 50 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 03771), BAC-transgenic Drd1a Cre/+ mice (EY262, Gensat), BAC-transgenic Drd2 Cre/+ mice (ER44, Gensat), BAC-transgenic Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice (CP73, Gensat), or BAC-transgenic Drd1a TdTomato/+ mice (Jackson Laboratory, 016204). For D1 neuron TRAP, Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice, which express an eGFP-tagged ribosome protein L10 under the Drd1 promoter, were bred to Il34 fl/fl ; Drd1a Cre/+ mice generating Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ ;Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice. For identification of D1 neurons for electrophysiological recording, Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ mice were bred to Drd1a TdTomato/+ mice to identify D1 neurons by tdTomato expression or Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ ;Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice were used to identify D1 neurons by eGFP expression.

To generate mice with a brain-specific conditional ablation of Csf1 , conditional Csf1 fl/fl mice 51 in which exons 4-6 were targeted for deletion, were bred to transgenic Nestin Cre/+ mice 50 (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 03771).

To achieve conditional microglia-specific ablation of CD39, conditional Cd39 fl/fl mice 29 , 52 were bred to knock in Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Jung) (Jackson Laboratory, stock number 020940) 53 mice.

To generate mice with a D1 neuron-specific conditional ablation of Adora1 , conditional Adora1 fl/fl mice 54 were bred to BAC-transgenic Drd1a Cre/+ mice (EY262, Gensat).

For non-microglia cell-type specific TRAP , adult BAC-transgenic Aldh1l1 eGFPL10a/+ mice (Jd130, Gensat) were used for astrocyte specific TRAP, BAC-transgenic Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice (Cp73, Gensat) were used for D1 neuron specific TRAP, and BAC-transgenic Drd2 eGFPL10a/+ mice (Cp101, Gensat) were used for D2 neuron specific TRAP.

For mice with an ablation of CD73 ( Nt5e) , Nt5e −/− mice 55 with a targeted deletion of Nt5e were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (stock number 018986).

For mice with an ablation of P2RY12 , P2ry12 −/− mice 3 , 24 , 56 were obtained from Dr. Ukpong Eyo at the University of Virginia.

For use of an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model , 5xfAD 57 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory/MMRRC (stock number 034840-JAX).

All mice used for experiments were backcrossed to the C57Bl/6J background for ≥ 5 generations. If not otherwise specified, Cre negative littermate controls were used as controls. Unless otherwise specified, male and female mice were used for all experiments (only male mice were used for social interaction behavior, live two-photon imaging of calcium transients in neurons, and live two-photon imaging of microglial process velocity and contact with boutons). Routine genotyping was performed by tail biopsy and PCR as previously described 25 , 45 – 52 , 58 .

Mice were anesthetized with CO 2 followed by decapitation. Brain regions of interest were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing. RNA extraction from frozen samples was performed using the TRIzol/Chloroform technique according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). After extraction, RNA was precipitated overnight at −80°C in isopropanol with 0.15M sodium acetate and Glycoblue (Life Technologies). The pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression of the cDNA was assayed by qPCR (StepOne Software, ThermoFisher) using pre-designed recommended TaqMan gene expression assays from Applied Biosystems following manufacturers recommendations (Il34, Csf1, Gapdh, Entpd1, Adora1, Ccl3, Cd74, Kdm6b, Adrb1, Ccl24, Kckn13, Ikbkb) . Cycle counts for mRNA quantification were normalized to Gapdh . Relative expression (ΔC T ) and quantification (RQ=2-ΔΔC T ) for each mRNA were calculated using ΔΔC T method as suggested.

This approach relies on the genetic labeling of the ribosomal protein L10a with the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) in a cell type-specific fashion followed by eGFP-based immunoaffinity purification of the ribosome-associated mRNAs 25 , 59 , 60 . The microglia-specific TRAP approach allows to assess rapid changes in microglial ribosomal RNA-association in the absence of aberrant microglia activation following tissue dissection and cell isolation 25 . To assess changes in microglia in response to CaMKII+ neuron activation and inhibition using the DREADD approach, microglia-specific eGFP-L10a expression in CaMKII-tTa;tetO-CHRM3;Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice, CaMKII-tTa;tetO-CHRM4;Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ; Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice, and control Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice was induced at 4-6 weeks of age using 6 consecutive administrations of 100mg/kg Tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) with a separation of at least 48 hours between doses. Neuronal excitation in CHRM3 mice was induced with 0.25 mg/kg CNO 2 hours prior to sacrificing the animals. Neuronal inhibition in CHRM4 mice was induced with 1 mg/kg CNO 2 hours prior to sacrificing the animals.

Mice were euthanized with CO 2 and the striatum was rapidly dissected and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated as described 25 , 60 , 61 . Microglia, astrocyte, D1, and D2 TRAP experiments were performed using freshly isolated tissue. D1 TRAP on Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ ;Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ and littermate controls was performed on rapidly frozen tissue. Brain tissue was immediately homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon glass homogenizer in ice-cold polysome extraction buffer (10mM HEPES [pH 7.3], 150mM KCl, 5mM MgCl 2 0.5mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), 100 μg/ml cyclohexamide (Sigma), EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10μl/ml RNasin (Promega) and Superasin (Applied Biosystems)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10min at 2000 x g, 4°C, to pellet large cell debris. NP-40 (EMD Biosciences, CA) and 1,2-Diheptanoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL) were added to the supernatant as a final concentration of 1% and 30mM, respectively. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the lysate was centrifuged for 10min at 13000 x g to pellet insoluble material. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (clones 19C8 and 19F7, Antibody and Bioresource Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering, NY) and biotinylated Protein L (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ)-coated Streptavidin MyOne T1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C with end-over-end rotation overnight. Beads were collected on a magnetic rack and washed four times with high-salt polysome wash buffer (10mM HEPES [pH 7.3], 350mM KCl, 5mM MgCl 2 , 1%NP-40, 0.5mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml cyclohexamide (Sigma)). RNA was purified from beads directly using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA purification from TRAP samples and from 5% of their corresponding unbound fractions was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions and used for subsequent sequencing. RNA integrity was assayed by using an RNA Pico chip on Bioanalyzer 2100 using 2100 Expert Software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and only samples with RIN>9 were considered for subsequent analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was generated from 1-5 ng RNA using Nugen Ovation V2 kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. 500 ng of cDNA per sample was sonicated to obtain fragments of 200 base pairs using Covaris-S2 system (Duty cycle: 10%, Intensity: 5.0, Bursts per second: 200, Duration: 120 seconds, Mode: Frequency sweeping, Power: 23W, Temperature: 5.5°C - 6°C, Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). These fragments were used to produce libraries for sequencing by TruSeq DNA Sample kit (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the libraries was assessed by the 2200 TapeStation (Agilent). Multiplexed libraries were directly loaded on NextSeq 500 (Ilumina) with High Output single read sequencing using 75 cycles. Raw sequencing data was processed with Illumina bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17.

Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using the TopHat2 package (v2.1.0) 62 . Reads were counted using HTSeq-count (v0.6.0) 63 against the Ensembl v67 annotation. The read alignment, read counting as well as quality assessment using metrics such as total mapping rate, mitochondrial and ribosomal mapping rates were done in parallel using an in-house workflow pipeline called SPEctRA 64 . The raw counts were processed through a variance stabilizing transformation (VST) procedure using the DESeq2 package 65 to obtain transformed values that are more suitable than the raw read counts for certain data mining tasks. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 500 most variable genes across all samples based on the VST data to visually assess if there were any outliers. Additionally, hierarchical clustering was used to assess the outliers once again to protect against false positives/negatives from PCA, and the outliers were further justified by the aforementioned quality control metrics as well as experimental metadata. After outlier removal, all pairwise comparisons were performed on the count data of entire gene transcripts using the DESeq2 package (v1.20.0) 65 .

For the analysis of microglia-specific TRAP in DREADD mice and in D1 neuron TRAP in Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ ;Drd1a eGFPL10a/+ mice and Cre negative controls, an enrichment cutoff of p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2 for each TRAP group over its respective unbound fraction was applied. For microglia-specific TRAP in DREADD mice, a cutoff of p-value < 0.05 and mean expression > 30 (DESeq2; n=2-3 per group; 3-6-month-old males and females) was applied. For D1 neuron TRAP, a cutoff of p-value < 0.05, fold change >1.5, and mean expression > 30 (DESeq2; n=3-4 per group; 4-month-old males and females) was applied. All analyses were carried out with age- and sex-matched controls.

For analysis of glial activation in bulk RNAseq, astrocyte activation markers were selected from those identified by Liddelow et al 66 and microglia sensome genes were selected from those identified in Hickman et al ( 92 ).

All of the MA plots and volcano plots were made using R (v3.1.1; https://www.R-project.org ). For all heatmaps, expression of each gene in log2 reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, or log2 RPKM was normalized to the mean across all samples (z-scored). Heatmaps with hierarchical clustering were made on Multiple Experiment Viewer 4.8 (v.10.2; http://www.tm4.org ) with Pearson Correlation by average link clustering 67 . Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr 68 , 69 . ENRICHR FDR values were calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg test in ENRICHR and P values were calculated using Fisher’s exact test in ENRICHR. Selected and significantly enriched (p-value < 0.05 with Benjamini-Hochberg correction) GO annotations for biological processes and are represented as bar graphs.

Striatal Nuclei Isolation was performed as previously described 25 . Mice were euthanized with CO 2 , and brain regions were quickly dissected and homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine pH 7.8 with a glass Dounce homogenizer (1984-10002, Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ). All buffers were supplemented with 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (11836170001, Roche). The homogenate was then spun through a 29% iodixanol cushion. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine pH 7.8, supplemented with 10 μM DyeCycle Ruby (V10304, Invitrogen) and 10% donkey serum (017-000-121, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Striatal nuclei were sorted in a BD FACSAria II cell sorter by gating for the lowest DyeCycle Ruby population, which indicates nuclei singlets.

Single nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on these samples using the Chromium platform (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) with the 3’ gene expression (3’ GEX) V2 kit, using a targeted input of ~5,000 nuclei per sample. Briefly, Gel-Bead in Emulsions (GEMs) were generated on the sample chip in the Chromium controller. Barcoded cDNA was extracted from the GEMs by Post-GEM RT-cleanup and amplified for 12 cycles. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end-repair, poly A-tailing, adapter ligation, and 10X-specific sample indexing following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and QuBit (Thermofisher) analysis and then sequenced in paired end mode on a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) targeting a depth of 50,000-100,000 reads per nuclei.

The raw read data were demultiplexed, aligned and analyzed by 10X Cell Ranger (v2.1.0). In order to capture unspliced pre-mRNA in the single nuclei RNA expression assay, intronic regions in 10X Cell Ranger mm10 v1.2.0 reference were marked as exonic as suggested by 10X for pre-mRNA reference generation. Data from two libraries were aggregated together with read depth normalized according to the number of mapped reads per nuclei of each library. A UMI threshold of 250 was manually selected to include the microglial population, resulting in a total of 15950 sequenced nuclei. The median number of UMIs detected per nuclei was 1707 UMI, with a median of 1075 genes per nuclei. Doublet populations were manually excluded from the analysis. Unique populations were manually annotated using known markers for striatal cell types 70 using the 10X Loupe Cell Browser (v2.0.0) (10X Genomics). Expression of individual genes was visualized by t-SNE on the Loupe Browser, with zero UMIs in gray. Cluster-specific upregulated genes (P<0.05) were determined using the “Significant Genes” tool in the Loupe Browser. Normalized expression values (UMIs per 10^3 UMIs) for selected genes were calculated for each sequenced nucleus using R and graphed by cell type with the ggplot2 package

In situ hybridization was performed as previously described 25 . 3-6 month old male and female wild type mice were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (24 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 10 ml PBS and 40ml of 10% neutral-buffered formalin, followed by removal and fixation of the brain in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Fixed brains were embedded in paraffin and sliced in 5-μm-thick sections, baked for 1 hour at 60°C, and stored at room temperature until further processing. In situ hybridization was carried out using RNAScope custom-designed probes for Il34, Csf1, and Entpd1 in combination with the RNAScope 2.0 Red kit per manufacturer’s recommendation (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). After completing in situ hybridization, before colorimetric reaction, sections were rinsed with ddH20 and a gradient concentration of PBS (0.1X-1X), blocked in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for one hour at room temperature and incubated with IBA1 antibody (019-19741, 1:100, Wako) overnight at 4°C. IBA1 signal was amplified with anti-rabbit horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and AlexaFluor 488 tyramide from Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were stained with DAPI (0.2 mg/ml), rinsed with a gradient concentration of PBS (1X-0.1X) and ddH20), subjected to colorimetric reaction, dried 15min at 60°C, mounted using EcoMount (EM897L, BioCare Medical), and dried overnight. Single plane images were taken on Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope and analyzed using Zen 2012 software. Cell counting was done using ImageJ cell counter tool. For localization of cells expressing Il34 or Csf1 in grey matter or white matter, single plane images (0.5mm x 0.5mm) that were on average 75% grey matter and 25% white matter were counted. 4-11 images were counted per mouse.

Microglia were isolated from neonatal (P5-P7) wild type mice for plating in Axion MEA plates, culture, and protein as previously described 25 , 71 . Mice were rapidly killed, brains were extracted, and meninges were removed prior to extracting forebrain. Tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers and enrichment of live cells was achieved by centrifugation over 20% Percoll (17-0891-02, GE Healthcare). The microglia were selected by anti-CD11b-coated microbeads (130-093-636, Miltenyi) with the QuadroMACs separator following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were manually counted with a hemocytometer using trypan exclusion staining. For co-culture with neurons in Axion MEA plates, 100,000 microglia were added per well. For HPLC, microglia were plated at 56,000/cm 2 in a 12-well plate with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (F4135, Sigma) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140, Gibco). Microglia purity was determined by FACS and immunostaining, cultured cells were also used for immunoblotting.

FACS analysis was used to determine microglial CD39 and CD73 surface expression as well purity of CD11b+ bead-isolated microglia. For confirmation of the purity of CD11b+ bead-isolated microglia, single cell suspensions were prepared from neonatal pups (4-6 forebrains, age P5-P7). For analysis of CD39 and CD73 expression on adult microglia, single cell suspensions were prepared from the forebrain of wild type, Cx3cr1 Cre Ert2/+(Litt) mice, which express cytosolic YFP under the microglial Cx3cr1 promoter, and Nt5e −/− (CD73 deficient) mice.

Tissue was rapidly dissected and mechanically dissociated in HBSS and centrifuged over 20% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and mononuclear cells were collected. Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (500mL sterile PBS, .5% BSA, 2ml 0.5M EDTA), blocked in FC blocker (BioRad) as per manufacturer’s instructions and then stained on ice for 15 minutes with a combination of the following antibodies: CD73-PE (12-0731-82, ThermoFisher), CD39-Alexafluor700 (24DMS1, ThermoFisher). The samples were stained with DAPI on the final resuspension. The percentage of CD39+ and CD73+ cells was determined using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on the Attune NxT flow cytometer (Invitrogen) and data was analyzed with FCS Express Plus software (De Novo Software). Compensation was performed on single-stained samples of UltraComp eBeads (ThermoFisher), unstained beads, and YFP unstained brain (YFP only) and unstained control cells. Gates were determined using unstained samples, fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls, in which one antibody was omitted per sample, and appropriate isotype controls for the CD73 antibody. Forward and side scatter was used to gate on a defined population of cells to exclude debris and also select single cells. Live cells were determined as DAPI negative. In Cx3cr1 Cre Ert2/+(Litt) mice, microglia were identified by YFP expression. FACS plots show gating on live cells that correspond to microglia, which made up 6-7% percentage of all cells in samples prepared from adult forebrain.

100% of YFP+ cells were CD39+. 0% of cells were YFP-/CD39+. Therefore, CD39-A700 was used to identify microglia in subsequent FACS experiments. In wild type and Nt5e −/− mice, single, live cells were identified by forward and side scatter gating as well as lack of DAPI- expression. Wild type and Nt5e −/− mice were stained with CD39-A700 to label microglia 72 and CD73-PE to identify CD73+ cells. Nt5e −/− mice were used in parallel to determine specificity of the CD73-PE antibody. 7% of live cells were CD39+ microglia in both WT and Nt5e −/− mice. 0% of cells were CD73+ in Nt5e −/− mice. CD73+ cells were determined using gates created from Nt5e −/− mice, IgG isotype control samples, and unstained samples.

Immunostaining was performed as previously described 25 , 61 . Male WT mice aged 3 months treated with control or PLX5622 diet for 3 weeks, 4-8 month old male and female CaMKII-tTa;tetO-CHRM3;Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice and CaMKII-tTa;tetO-CHRM4; Cx3cr1 CreErt2/+(Litt) ;Eef1a1 LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice 2 hours after CNO, 3 month old Il34 fl/fl ;Nestin Cre/+ , Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ , Il34 fl/fl ;Drd2 Cre/+ , Csf1 fl/fl ;Nestin Cre/+ , and Cd39 fl/fl ;Cx3cr1 CrErt2/+(Litt) mice and littermate controls were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (24 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 10 ml PBS and 40 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Fixed brains were removed and dehydrated in 5%, 15% and 30% sucrose in PBS. Following dehydration, brains were frozen in Neg-50 (Thermo Scientific) on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Brains were cut using a cryostat and 25-μm sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were stored at −80 °C until staining. Slides were washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) and blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBST for one hour at room temperature. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies (IBA1 (1:500) 019-19741, Wako; CD11b (1:500) MCA711GT, Biorad; GFP (1:2000) ab6556, Abcam; GFP (1:500) ab13970, Abcam; NeuN (1:500) MAB377, Millipore; NEUN (1:500) ABN91, Millipore, cFOS (1:1000) ab190289, Abcam; GFAP (1:500) G3893, Sigma; OLIG2 (1:500) sc-293163, Santa Cruz; P2RY12 (1:1000) AS-55043A, Anaspec;) in 2% normal goat serum in PBST overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed in PBST and incubated in Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-, 546-, and 568- and 647-labeled goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat, goat anti-chicken, or goat anti-rabbit IgGs (H+L); 1:500, Thermo Scientific) in 2% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h at RT. Slides were washed and coverslipped using Prolong Gold anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen) and dried overnight. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 Confocal Microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, DE). For z-stack images, 20-μm z-stack confocal images were acquired at 2-μm intervals, with 40×/1.3 oil objective at 0.6 or 1x zoom. For single plane images, 4.6 μm images were acquired at 20x/.8 or 40x/1.3 objectives 0.6 or 1x zoom. Image processing was performed using Zen 2012 software (Zeiss). Cell counting was done using ImageJ cell counter tool by counting cFOS + cells or IBA1 + cells that overlapped with DAPI + nuclei. Graphs show average number of cells (n=3-4 images) per mouse.

For identification of microglial localization (white matter or grey matter within the striatum), white matter was identified by the high levels of autofluorescence and lack of neuronal soma. The specificity of the approach was validated by immunostaining with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, ab112, Abcam), which labels neuronal terminals in the striatum and is restricted to grey matter (data not shown). Graphs show average number of cells in WM and GM per mouse (n=2-4 mice, 4-11 images per mouse). Striatal images were taken at 20x as described above. ImageJ was used to calculate the percentage of the image that was white matter or gray matter.

Western blot analysis was performed as previously described 25 , 61 . Male and female age-matched mice were used. Mice were anesthetized with CO 2 followed by decapitation, and the region of interest was rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further processing. For analysis of DARPP32 phosphorylation, mice were euthanized, brains were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and frozen striatum punches were extracted. Samples were sonicated at 4 °C in 1% SDS solution supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche, Switzerland) and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, Switzerland), and boiled for ten minutes. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisherScientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples were diluted in equal volume of 2X LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 200 mM (Sigma).

20-40 μg of tissue protein samples were separated on 4-12% Bolt Bis-tris precast denaturing gels or 10% NuPAGE Bis-tris precast denaturing gels (Invitrogen, USA) and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour and probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk-TBST solution or 2% BSA overnight at 4 °C (DARPP32, (1:1000), Novus, Cat#NB300-304; DARPP32-THR34, (1:1000), Cell Signaling, Cat#12438; DARPP32-THR75, (1:1000), clone cc911 and DARPP32, (1:5000), clone 6a kindly provided by A Nairn and P Greengard; IL34, (1:1000), Abcam, Cat#AF5195; GLUR1-SER845, (1:1000), Cell Signaling, Cat#8084; GLUR1, (1:1000), Millipore, Cat#MAB2263, DRD1, (1:1000), Abcam, Cat#ab20066; CD39, (1:1000), R&D Systems, Cat#AF4398; CD73, (1:500), Cell Signaling, Cat#13160 H3, (1:5000), Abcam, Cat#ab1791; IBA1, (1:1000), Wako, Cat#016-20001; P2RY12, (1:1000), Anaspec, Cat#AS-55043A). Membranes were then washed and probed with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse (GE), anti-rabbit IgG (GE), anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) or anti-sheep IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, USA) secondary antibody (all 1:10000) for one hour at room temperature. Membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer, USA) and exposed on film. Exposed films were scanned, and protein bands were quantified using ImageJ Software (NIH, USA). All values were plotted relative to littermate control samples.

For immunoblotting of CD11b+ isolated microglia, cells were counted on a hemocytometer and centrifuged at 300g for 15 min to pellet cells. Cells were resuspended in 100uL of lysis buffer (see above), sonicated, and boiled for ten minutes. The lysed cells were concentrated by centrifugation (Protein Concentrator Tubes, 3K, Pierce) and diluted in equal volume of 2X LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with DTT (final concentration 200mM) to a final concentration of 50,000 cells/uL. Increasing amounts of cells were loaded along with whole tissue samples of control and CD73 −/− striatal lysate (5ng). Samples were run, transferred, and incubated in primary and secondary antibody as described above. Membranes were developed using chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer) (CD39, P2RY12, IBA1, H3) or with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoScientific) for less abundant proteins (CD73).

Slice biotinylation was adapted from previously described protocols 73 , 74 . 10-week old male and female Il34 fl/fl and Il34 fl/fl ;Drd1a Cre/+ mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the brain was rapidly removed and sliced (300uM) in prechilled, pre-saturated (95%/5% O 2/ CO 2 ) 1X SACSF on a vibratome. Slices were recovered for 45 minutes at 31°C in oxygenated ACSF. Following recovery, slices were incubated with 1.0 mg/mL sulf-NHS-SS-biotin on ice for 45 minutes. Slices were washed 3x with ice cold ACSF and incubated for 10 minutes in ice cold ACSF. Slices were then washed 3x with ice cold quench buffer (ACSF, 100mM glycine and incubated twice for 25 minutes on ice to quench excess free biotin. Slices were then washed in ice cold ACSF three times and the striatum was micro-dissected. Tissue was pelleted by centrifuging at 200g for 1 min. Supernatant was removed and tissue was resuspended in 300uL ice cold RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) with protease inhibitors (Roche) and pipetted to break up tissues. To complete tissue lysis, samples were incubated for 30min at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Debris was pelleted by spinning at 1800g for 15 minutes. Supernatant was collected and heated at 98°C for 10 minutes and sample concentration was assessed by BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. A portion of protein was aliquoted and diluted in equal volume of 2X LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 200mM (Sigma) to serve as input. Streptavidin MyOne T1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were washed in RIPA/PI buffer and added to known concentration of protein lysis and were rotated at 4°C overnight. The following day, samples were spun down and biotinylated and unbound fractions were magnetically separated and collected. Biotinylated proteins were eluted off magnetic beads in 2X LDS sample buffer supplemented with DTT by boiling for 5 minutes at 95°C and separated on magnet. Equal amounts of protein (5ug-20ug) were loaded for immunoblotting.

Primary neuronal culture was performed as previously described 75 . Embryonic day 18 (E18) timed-pregnant female mice were anesthetized with CO 2 and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. In a dissection hood, 10-12 embryos per experiment were collected through an incision of the mother’s abdomen, taken out of the amniotic sacs, and decapitated in ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Using fine scissors and forceps, brains were rapidly dissected and the cortex cleared from meninges and isolated under a dissection microscope. Cortices were collected in ice-cold HBSS and kept on ice until all embryos had been dissected. In a tissue culture hood, HBSS was removed and the cortex tissue was digested by 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37°C, followed by DNase1 treatment for 10 min at 37°C. The tissue was dissociated by serial trituration with a 25-ml serological pipette, followed by trituration with 10 and 5 ml serological pipettes. Cell suspension was washed once with DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and passed through a 40μm cell strainer before being counted on a hemocytometer. Single cells were seeded on poly- d -lysine (0.1 mg ml −1 )–coated wells at a density of 10 6 cells per well on a 12-well plate. Cells were grown in neurobasal medium, complemented with B27 supplement, N2 supplement, and 0.5 mM l -glutamine and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 .

For multiple electron array (MEA) recordings, AccuSpot Classic MEA 48 plate with 16 microelectrodes per well were used (M768-KAP-48A, Axion). Plates were pre-incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for one hour with 5 microliters of 0.1% PEI (P3143, Sigma) in borate buffer (Boric acid (A73-500, Fisher), Sodium tetraborate (221732, Sigma). After incubation, plates were washed 4 times with 200 microliters dH20 and dried overnight in the hood with the lid cracked. The following day, neurons were cultured as described above, and the dried Axion plate was coated with 20 micrograms/ml laminin in neurobasal medium (L2020, Sigma) mid-way through the neuronal culture. 5 microliters of laminin were dropped into each well of the plate and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 1-2 hours without letting the plate dry. Laminin was removed directly before seeding the well with neurons. Neurons were diluted to 12 million cells/mL and 5 microliters were dropped onto each well to seed 60,000 neurons/well. The plate was incubated for 1 hour and then 250 microliters of DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was added to each well. The following day 250 microliters of neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 supplement, N2 supplement, and 0.5 mM l-glutamine was added to the wells. Half media change with neurobasal medium with supplements was performed every 3 days. Microglia were isolated using the Macs Miltenyi system as described in Ayata et al. 25 and 100,000 isolated microglia were added to each well of the MEA plate on DIV12. Baseline Axion recordings were performed at DIV 14 on the Axion Maestro MEA reader and the electrical activity of the culture was recorded for 10 minutes and analyzed with the AxIS software. On DIV14 two hours after baseline recording, the MEA plate was treated with combinations of the following compounds: 10μM Glutamate (Sigma), 100nM A 1 R agonist (CPA, Tocris), 100nM A 1 R antagonist (DCPCX, Sigma), 10uM adenosine (Sigma) 200μM CD39 inhibitor (2 hour pretreatment, ARL 67156, Tocris). Recordings were performed 1 hour after treatment. For analysis, wells were excluded if the mean firing rate was <1Hz or if the well contained inactive electrodes (<16 active electrodes).

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and striata were rapidly dissected, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C until processing. Weighed tissue was sonicated in 1XPBS and adenosine was measured by fluorometric assay (MET-5090, Cell BioLabs) following manufacturer’s instructions.

Male mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas/carbogen mixture (5% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance during surgery) and carefully placed to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). Body temperature was maintained at 36–37 °C and ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent eyes from drying. After shaving their hair and sterilizing the skin with chlorhexidine, a midline incision was made with a sterile scalpel. Then a surgical scissor was used to cut off extra skin and further expose the skull surface. The skull surface was wiped and cleaned with autoclaved cotton swabs. Bregma and lambda were identified and leveled to be on the same z-axis. Then a craniotomy hole was drilled over the striatum (antero-posterior: −0.1 mm, medio-lateral: - 1.5 mm relative to Bregma) with drill bits (#73 size, Kyocera). 600μl of AAV9 Syn-GCaMP6s (Addgene, #100843) were injected into the striatum (antero-posterior: −0.1 mm, medio-lateral: - 1.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −2.85 mm relative to Bregma) using a blunt 35-gauge microinjection needle within a 10μL microsyringe (NanoFil, World Precision Instruments, FL, USA), which was controlled by a microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments) and a controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments). The AAV is injected at a rate of 50nl/min.

Following viral injection, a 23-gauge needle is mounted to a stereotaxic cannula holder (Doric lenses) and lowered to 0.5mm above the injection site (antero-posterior: −0.1 mm, medio-lateral: - 1.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −2.25 mm relative to Bregma). After holding the needle at that location for 5 minutes, it was retracted and lowered to coordinate mentioned above several times to create the path for GRIN Lens implantation. After the complete retraction of the 23-gauge needle, the GRIN Lens of 0.6mm diameter, 7.3mm length (INSCOPIX, INC, CA, USA) was assembled with a ferrule using super glue (Loctite) and mounted to a stereotaxic cannula holder (Doric lenses), then lowered to 0.15mm above the injection site (antero-posterior: −0.1 mm, medio-lateral: - 1.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −2.7 mm relative to Bregma). A layer of adhesive cement (C&B Metabond, Parkell Inc.) was applied to the skull surface to strongly hold the implanted ferrule. After adhesive cement was completely dried, a thick layer of dental cement (Lang Dental) was applied to build a head cap. Before the head cap fully solidified, we applied some super glue on the bottom surface of the head ring and place the head ring around the exposed ferrule. Then we wrapped the exposed upper surface of the lens with a small piece of parafilm, then add KWIK-SIL on top to protect the lens. Mice were given 1 mg/kg buprenorphine SR and 5 mg/kg ketoprofen s.c. intraoperatively and received 30 mg/kg ibuprofen in their home cage water for seven days post-surgery.

After a 1-2 week recovery from the surgery, the mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, one group received PLX5622 and one group received control chow (lacking inhibitor).

The mice were later put under water restriction (1.5 ml/day) and were handled and habituated daily to head-fixation and immobilization for ~2 weeks. They were immobilized in a polyethylene tube and head-fixed in the future recording environment under 2-photon microscope. During this habituation period, we increased the head-fixation period from 3 minutes to 40 minutes gradually. After they showed no signs of stress and drank water provided randomly during the 40-minute session, we switched to no-water-provided head fixation habituation for future recording.

After habituation to head-fixation, we also performed daily habituation to i.p. injection before the head-fixation session. Mice were injected i.p. with a microlitre volume equivalent to 10× the body weight in grams (10 × BW μl) of saline, matching the volume to be injected in future imaging sessions, and then performed head-fixation. This habituation was performed for ~1 week until the mice showed a reduction in clear signs of stress upon handling and i.p. injection.

We use a customized 2-Photon microscope with galvo-galvo scanner for imaging. The setting we used through the session below is 4Hz scan rate at 194 by 194 pixels. The imaging protocol lasted for 7 days and included 3 sessions.

Session 1: 3 days of baseline recording, we i.p. injected 10XBW μl of saline and started the recording 10 minutes after the injection and image for 10 minutes. For analysis of baseline neuronal activity, data was pooled from three days of 10 minute baseline (saline injection) recording.

Session 2: 3 days of recording after SKF81297 injection, we i.p. injected 10XBW μl of SKF81297 solution (3mg/kg, diluted in saline) and started the recording 10 minutes after injection. A low dose of SKF81297 was used to avoid confounds induced by seizure activity. The imaging lasted for 30 minutes, analyzed in 10-minute bins, to capture the whole post-injection dynamics. For the analysis of neuronal activity in response to SKF81297, data was pooled across three days of imaging for each 10-minute bin starting 10 minutes post injection (first bin: 10-20 minutes after injection, second bin: 20-30 minutes after injection, and third: 30-40 minutes after injection).

Session 3: 1 day of recording after i.p. injection of mixed solution of SKF81297 (3 mg/kg, diluted in saline) and CPA (0.1 mg/kg, diluted in saline). The recording was started 10 minutes after injection and lasted for 30 minutes. For the analysis of neuronal activity in response to co-administration of SKF81297 and CPA, data was pooled from the 30 minute imaging session.

The calcium imaging data were originally acquired as DAT file in our customized system and later processed into TIF files. The data were firstly rigid motion corrected using the custom script adapted from NoRMCorre ( https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre ), the technical details could be found in the relevant paper 76 .

The motion-corrected data was later ran through pipeline adapted from Suite2P ( https://github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P ) 77 for automatic ROI detection and spike deconvolution. To account for out-of-focus contamination from background signals F bg , a fraction d = 0.7, of the background was subtracted from the raw fluorescence F raw . The relative change in fluorescence was calculated as: dF / F = F − F 0 F 0

Where F is the background corrected fluorescence F = F raw − d · F bg and F 0 is the median of the F distribution.

To identify significant calcium events, we use a peak detection algorithm that identifies maxima in the derivative of the dF/F signal implemented in Matlab 97 . The identified maxima must be above a threshold, defined as the mean plus three standard deviations of the dF/F distribution.

To understand how the similarity between calcium traces of neurons varies as a function of their distance between each other, we utilized a method described before 78 which involves calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between two time series traces x and y, were: PCC = E [ ( x − μ x ( y − μ y ) ) ] σ x σ y

Where E[·] is the expectation operator and μ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation, respectively. The PCC was calculated for pairs of neurons where the distance between them was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the centers of their somas.

Synchrony was calculated as previously defined in Barbera et al., 2016 79 . In brief, onsets of calcium transients were identified with a threshold crossing of 2 times the standard deviation of the calcium trace baseline. In order to account for uncertainty associated with threshold detection, each event is represented as a 750 ms (3 frame) pulse centered at the onset of the calcium trace. We defined two events to be synchronous if they overlap at least at one time instant. The binary matrix was then used to calculate synchrony between two cells as the average of the ratio of the number of times both cells were simultaneously active to the total activations of each cell.

For imaging of microglia and synaptic terminals, male Cx3cr1 eGFP/+ mice (8-10 weeks) derived from the C57BL/6J strain, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expresses under microglial Cx3cr1 promoter were used. For Ca 2+ imaging of synaptic terminals, male C57BL/6J mice (6-10 weeks) were used.

Mice were anesthetized by mixture of ketamine (74 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). The skull was exposed and disinfected, and a custom-made head plate was firmly attached using dental cement (Fujiryu-to BC; GC, Tokyo, Japan, Bistite II; Tokuyama Dental, Tokyo, Japan) onto the skull. Mice were allowed to recover for 1 day before the following craniotomy and viral injection.

For virus injection, a circular craniotomy (2 mm diameter) was performed over the left primary motor cortex (centered at 0.2 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral from bregma) under isoflurane (1%) anesthesia. For imaging of microglia and synaptic terminals, mixed AAV (Addgene; AAV8.hSyn.hM3D(Gq).mCherry: 5 × 10 12 vector genomes/ml, UPenn Vector Core; AAV2/1-CAG-FLEX-Tdtomato: 7.6 × 10 12 vector genomes/ml, and AAV2/1-CaMKII-Cre: 2.94 × 10 13 vector genomes/ml (1:10,000) diluted in saline) solution was injected into the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus (1 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral from bregma, 3,600 μm deep). For Ca 2+ imaging of synaptic terminals, AAV2/1-Syn-GCaMP6s: 2.7 ×10 13 vector genomes/mL (1:2 diluted in saline) and AAV8.hSyn.hM3D.Gq.mCherry was injected into ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus (1 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral from bregma, 3,600 μm deep). To exclude the effect of CNO, control mice with the same AAV2/1-CAG-FLEX-Tdtomato and AAV2/1-CaMKII-Cre cocktail but omitting AAV8.hSyn.hM3D(Gq).mCherry were used. Virus was filled in glass capillary with filament (GDC-1; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and injected into stereotaxic coordinates over 5 minutes. After the injection, a double glass window comprised of 2 and 4.5 mm glass slips (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) jointed together with an ultraviolet curable adhesive (NOR-61, Norland) was implanted over the craniotomy.

All the imaging was conducted 5 weeks after the virus injection to acquire sufficient virus expression and brain tissue recovery to prevent microglial activation 80 .

The two-photon microscopy setup was composed of a laser scanning system (NIS-Elements; Nikon Instech Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) set at 950-nm and a water-immersion objective lens (25×, N.A. 1.10; Nikon Instech Co., Ltd.). XYZT imaging was conducted over the primary motor cortex, and the imaging plane was within 100-150μm from the surface. 1024×1024 pixels imaging field was 129.96μm × 129.96μm with a pixel size of 0.1269μm. Z-step was 1μm, each XYZ frame duration was 1 minute and whole imaging session was 3 hours long. For DREADDs excitation or microglial P2Y12R inhibition, Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK; 5 mg/kg) or Clopidogrel (Sanofi-Aventis; 100 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline and freshly prepared before every injection. CNO, Clopidogrel and CNO + Clopidogrel imaging sessions were started immediately after the intravenous administration of CNO to mice. Note that the mice used for each experiment were totally naive for all drugs. In control imaging, mice were treated with saline injection. Mice were imaged for 3 hours immediately after injection.

Analysis was performed using ImageJ (1.52v; NIH). All images were corrected for focal plane and depth direction displacements using HyperStackReg (Ved Sharma, 2015-2016). For quantification of interactions between microglia and pre-synapses, 2 μm diameter ROIs were manually defined around axonal boutons, and mean intensity in green channel (microglia) within each ROI was measured for all frames. To normalize value, mean intensity was divided by the average intensity of 5 control frames within the same ROI, which were recorded before drug stimulation. Microglial contact onto boutons was further demonstrated by measuring the Pearson’s correlation coefficient value of red and green channels with ImageJ Coloc 2 plugin. For the assessment of microglial motility in time-lapse images, ImageJ built-in tool Manual Tracking was used to track tips of primary processes in each frame. Microglial tips were identified by the eGFP expression ( Cx3cr1 eGFP/+ mice). 7-9 microglia tips per microglia were tracked for 2-4 microglia per mouse. We measured the trajectory of primary processes that were defined as branches emanating directly from the cell body. To track the process tips, we first identified the tips by projecting 20 × 1 μm z slices and the farthest point of each primary processes were plotted with ImageJ software. The ImageJ built-in tool Manual Tracking was used to track tips of processes for each frame.

All the imaging was conducted 5 weeks after the virus injection to acquire sufficient virus expression and brain tissue recovery to prevent microglial activation.

The two-photon microscopy setup was composed of a laser scanning system (NIS-Elements; Nikon Instech Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) set at 950nm and a water-immersion objective lens (25X, N.A. 1.10; Nikon Instech Co., Ltd.). XYT imaging was conducted over the primary motor cortex with axonal terminals expressing GCaMP6s via viral transfection in ventral lateral nucleus. Imaging plane was within 100-150μm from the cortical surface. 512×512 pixels imaging field was 130.02 μm × 130.02 μm with a pixel size of 0.2539 μm. 1,000 XYT frame was taken in each imaging at 2 fps. Ca 2+ responses under three different conditions were conducted on the same day in each mouse, in the order of pre-injection, saline injection, and CNO injection. For DREADDs excitation of neurons, Clozapine -N-oxide (CNO; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK; 5 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline and freshly prepared before every experiment. Saline and CNO imaging sessions were started 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of drug or the same amount of saline to mice.

Analysis was performed using ImageJ (1.52v; NIH) and MATLAB (2019b; The Mathworks, Natick, MA). All images were corrected for focal plane using TurboReg 81 . Axonal terminal identification, Ca 2+ activity extraction and quantification of Area Under the Curve (AUC) were conducted using the customized MATLAB script.

8- to 12-week old male and female Il34 fl/fl ; Drd1a Cre/+ ; Drd1a tdTomato mice were used for all electrophysiology experiments. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by transcardial perfusion with oxygenated (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) HEPES solution (in mM: 92 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 30 NaHCO 3 , 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 Na + ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na + pyruvate, 10 MgSO 4 7H 2 O, 0.5 CaCl 2 2 H 2 O, with pH adjusted to 7.3– 7.4, 300 –310 mOsm). The brain was quickly removed into ice-cold NMDG HEPES solution for 1 min. Two hundred μm-thick coronal slices containing striatum were cut with a vibratome (Leica VT1200S, Germany). Slices were then moved into a pre-warmed (32°C) recovery chamber and carried out the stepwise Na + spike-in procedure 82 , then kept at room temperature for at least 1 h, in the following solution: 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 -equilibrated HEPES-holding-solution containing the following (in mM) 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 30 NaHCO 3 , 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 Na + ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na + pyruvate, 2 MgSO 4 7H 2 O, and 2 CaCl 2 , 2 H 2 O.

Recordings were made under an upright microscope (Scientifica SliceScope Pro 2000, Scientifica, UK) equipped with infrared differential interference contrast optics for visualization. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber superfused with standard recording ACSF containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 24 NaHCO 3 , 5 HEPES, 12.5 glucose, 2 MgSO 4 7H2O and 2 CaCl 2 2H2O, adjusted to pH 7.3–7.4, 295 – 305 mOsm. Recordings were performed at 32°C. Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (1B150F-4; World Precision Instruments) using a micropipette puller (PC-10; Narishige, Japan).

For spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) measurements in the striatum, the internal recording pipette solution was potassium-based contained the following (in mM): K+ gluconate 130, KCl 4, EGTA 0.3, HEPES 10, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.3, Phosphocreatine 10; pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH while the external solution was ACSF + 100 μM picrotoxin. sEPSCs were recorded from the red fluorescent protein (RFP) positive dorsal striatum neurons using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 3 kHz, amplified five times, and then digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1550 analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices). Voltage was held at −80 mV (Vhold = −80 mV). Neurons were allowed to stabilize after rapturing membrane for at least 10 min and sEPSCs were recorded. For sEPSCs event analysis, the baseline was adjusted to 0 pA and the events threshold was set at 5 pA, and then sequential events from >60 sec analysis window were individually identified using Clampfit 10.3 software (Molecular Devices). Experiment and analysis were performed without knowledge of genotype.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (7 mg/kg), transcardially perfused with ice cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; containing in mM: 124.0 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 1.0 CaCl 2 , 2.0 MgCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , and 16.66 glucose), and sagittal brain slices (275 μm thick) were sectioned using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems). Ex vivo brain slices entailing the dorsolateral striatum were transferred to a holding chamber (34°C) with aCSF (containing in mM: 124.0 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 2.0 CaCl 2 , 1.0 MgCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , and 16.66 glucose) for a recovery period of 30-40 minutes prior to experimentation; all solutions were pH 7.4, 310-320 mOsm and continually bubbled with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 .

Slices were placed in a recording chamber and direct spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) visualized by ribosomal eGFP expressed in dSPNs with a laser scanning microscope system (Bruker) and two-photon laser (Coherent, Inc.); 810 nm excitation was used throughout. Identified SPNs were patched under an Olympus 60X/0.9NA lens using glass pipettes (3–4.5MΩ resistance); patch pipettes were filled with internal recording solution containing (in mM): 135.0 KMeSO4, 5.0 KCL, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, 5 phosphocreatine-Tris, 5.0 phospocreatine-Na, 0.1 spermine; pH 7.25–7.30 and 270–280 mOsm. EGTA was omitted and replaced with the calcium sensitive dye Fluo-4 (200μM); to visualize dendrites the anatomical dye Alexa 568 (50μM) was included. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were acquired at 32-34 degrees Celsius using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier as previously described 83 , 84 . Intrinsic excitability was tested in current clamp with 500 ms somatic current injections (25 pA steps). Dendritic excitability was assayed by somatic current injection to evoke back propagating action potentials (bAPs). bAP associated Fluo-4 fluorescent signals were measured in proximal (30-60 μm from the soma) and distal (>80 μm from the soma) dendrites and spines using 2PLSM. 84 Data are presented as the dendritic index which is calculated by dividing distal by proximal fluorescence; ‘fluorescence’ measurements refers to area under the curve of the fluorescence trace normalized to the fluorescence intensity of the anatomical dye (AlexaFluor 568). This method of analysis was used to correct for differences in dye loading, laser power and optical path. Whole cell z -series were acquired as previously described 83 , 84 and dendritic arborization analyzed using Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience).

C57/Bl6 male mice were put on PLX5622 or control chow (n=5 PLX5622 diet, n=5 control diet). for one week. Dialysis probes were implanted and mice recovered for one week before commencing microdialysis collection. Microdialysis guide cannulae (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) were stereotaxically implanted in the striatum (A/P: +1.4 mm; M/L: −1.0 mm; D/V: −3.8 mm from skull). Microdialysis experiments were conducted following a one-week recovery period following guide cannula implantation. Dialysis tubing was flushed prior to initial use with 70% EtOH for 5 minutes, followed by dH2O syringe pump (Model R99-E, Razel Scientific Instruments, Saint Albans, VT) at a flow rate of 1 μL/min. The tubing was then attached to the microdialysis probe (Cuprophane (6kD), membrane length 1mm; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), which was primed by placing the probe in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; pH 7.4: 148 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl 2 , 0.85 mM MgCl 2 ) and running aCSF through the microdialysis tubing and probe at a 0.8 μL/min rate. Microdialysis experiments were done in anesthetized animals. Briefly, mice were placed into a stereotaxic frame under isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction,1.75% sustained). The probe was inserted via the guide cannula and allowed to equilibrate. Dialysate was collected after 20 minutes. All collections were frozen at −80 degrees Celsius immediately following collection completion.

Adenosine was quantified using ultra pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) in the Vanderbilt University Neurochemistry Core. Analytes in 5μL of microdialysis fluid were derivatized by sequential dilution with 10uL 100mM NaCO 3 (aq) and 2% benzoyl chloride (BZC) in acetonitrile. Following a two minute incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10uL internal standard solution (in 20% acetonitrile containing 3% sulfuric acid). The adenosine internal standard was prepared by derivatization with 13C6-benzoyl chloride as described. Standard stocks were frozen at −80 °C in aliquots to prevent multiple freeze/thaw cycles. A single internal standard stock aliquot was thawed the day of use, diluted 100-fold in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 3% (v/v) sulfuric acid. BZC and NaCO 3 solutions were made fresh daily.

LC was performed on a 2.0 x 50 mm, 1.7mm particle Acquity BEH C18 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) using a Waters Acquity UPLC attached to a Waters Xevo TQ-XS triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mobile phase A was 15% aqueous formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The flow rate was 200uL/min and the elution gradient was as follows: initial, 1% B; 0.1 min, 7% B; 0.5 min, 15% B; 14 min, 55% B; 14.5 min, 70% B; 18 min, 99% B; 19 min, 99% B; and 19.1 min, 1% B. An additional 5 min of equilibration time was required for reproducible chromatography.

The adenosine internal standard was prepared by derivatization with 13 C 6 -benzoyl chloride as described 85 . Standard stocks were frozen at−80 °C in aliquots to prevent multiple freeze/thaw cycles. A single internal standard stock aliquot was thawed the day of use, diluted 100-fold in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 3% (v/v) sulfuric acid.

Microglia were isolated from neonatal pups as described above. Cultured microglia were pre-treated with CD39 inhibitor (ARL67156, 200uM), CD73 inhibitor (APCP, 10uM) or control (.04% DMSO) 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100uM ATP. 60min after ATP treatment, 200uL of media was removed and chilled on ice for 10 minutes. Samples were spun at 400g for 10minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and treated with 7.5uL of 8M perchloric acid (PCA), vortexed, flash frozen and stored at −80°C until processing. PCA-treated samples were neutralized with 0.4 M K 2 HPO 4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and analyzed with an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a G1312B binary pump, a G1367C high performance autosampler and a G1314C Variable Wavelength Detector VL+ set at 254 nm. Nucleotides were separated by ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography using an Atlantis dC18 column (3 mm x 150 mm, particle size 3 μm; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The samples were loaded on the column equilibrated with buffer A (0.1 M KH 2 PO 4 , 4 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, Sigma-Aldrich; pH 6). The mobile phase developed linearly from 0 to 100% buffer B (70% buffer A/30% methanol) during the first 13 min and remained isocratic at 100% buffer B for 12 min. Subsequently, the column was re-equilibrated with buffer A for 7 minutes. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine were identified by their retention times and concentrations were calculated using known standards run in parallel.

10-week old male mice were implanted with a wireless EEG device (HD-X02, Data Sciences International) into the subcutaneous pocket posterior to the neck and continuously recorded in the home cage. EEG leads were placed between the dura and skull, with one lead above the frontal cortex and one lead over the contralateral parietal cortex. EMG leads were placed in the neck muscle. Meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and Ampicillin (20 mg/kg) was administered both during surgery and for 2 days after surgery. Data were acquired with a telemetry system (Data Sciences International) running Ponemah v6 software and analyzed using Neuroscore v3.2.9 software (Data Sciences International). For comparison of control and microglia deficient mice, transmitters were implanted and mice were placed on PLX or control chow and allowed to recover for at least one week. Seizures were visually identified behaviorally and from the EEG and EMG.

All behavior analyses were performed during the 0700–1900 light cycle. When possible, experimenters were blinded to the genotypes of the animals and genotypes were decoded after data was processed and analyzed. All subjects correspond to data points within two standard deviations from the sample mean and no subjects were excluded from the behavioral analyses. For all behavioral experiments, sex and age-matched corresponding littermate control animals were used. No randomization protocol was used. Animals were allocated to treatment groups to ensure uniform distribution of ages and sexes in each group. All procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the IACUC at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

For all seizure experiments, 14-20 week old mice were used. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the microliter volume equivalent to 10x the body weight (g). D1 receptor agonist (SKF 81297, Tocris) was diluted from stock (50mg/ml in DMSO) with 0.9% saline to indicated concentration to induce seizures 86 . Kainic acid (Sigma, K0250) was dissolved in saline just before use to indicated concentration for i.p. injections to induce seizures 87 . Picrotoxin (Tocris) was diluted from stock (10 mg/mL in ethanol) with 0.9% saline to administer at 1 mg/kg to induce seizures 88 . A 1 R-agonist (N6-Cyclopentyladenosine, CPA, Tocris) was diluted from stock (50 mg/mL in DMSO) in 0.9% saline to 0.1 mg/kg. A 1 R antagonist (8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, DPCPX, Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted from stock (10 mg/mL in DMSO) to inject at 1 mg/mL. A 2A agonist (CGS 21680, Sigma) was diluted from stock (10 mg/mL in DMSO) in 0.9% saline to inject at a final dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Clopidogrel (Sanofi-Aventis, kindly provided by J.J. Badimon, as administered in Sipe et al 89 ) was diluted from stock (50 mg/ml in DMSO) with 0.9% saline to inject at 100 mg/kg. Ticagrelor (Astra Zeneca, kindly provided by J.J. Badimon, as administered in Sipe et al. 89 ) was dissolved in DMSO:PEG400:Triton80 5:35:10 and then diluted in saline. To assess the effects of inflammation on seizure susceptibility, mice were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma, 0.2 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg) 24 hours prior to D1 agonist administration.

Animals were observed for the time of onset of seizures and scored on the Racine scale 90 . Seizure behavior was monitored under a modified Racine scale as follows: (1) normal behavior; (2) rigid posture with raised tail; (3) continuous head bobbing and forepaws shaking; (4) rearing, falling, and jumping; (5) loss of posture and generalized convulsion activity 90 .

Locomotion and exploratory behavior was measured using the open field analysis in a new environment (clear plexiglass 40 × 40 × 30 cm open field arena) as previously described 25 , 61 , 75 . Activity in the open-field was quantified with Fusion Software (v5.0) (Omnitech Electronics). The distance traveled was recorded for each mouse. Data were collected at 5-10 min intervals over 30-90 minute test sessions.

The motor function and balance of mice was analyzed using the standard accelerated rotarod test (4-40 rpm/5 min, Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) as previously described 25 , 61 . The time taken for the mice to fall from the rod was measured in seconds. If a mouse, clinging on to the rod, completed two full passive rotations, the mouse was removed from the trial and the time was recorded as fallen from the rod. If a mouse stayed on the rod until the end of the 5-minute trial, a time of 300 seconds was recorded. After one training trial, mice were subjected to three consecutive trials/day with 5 min inter-trial intervals for three consecutive days and measurements were taken from each trial.

The elevated plus maze test was used to determine the unconditioned response to a potentially dangerous environment. Anxiety-related behavior was measured by the degree to which the rodent avoided the open arms of the maze. The mice were placed at the junction of the elevated 4-arm maze in which 2 arms are open and 2 are enclosed. The number of times the animal entered each of the arms and the time spent in each arm was recorded for 5 min by the EthoVision video-tracking system (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA). Total arm entries, percentage of open arm entries, and percentage of time spent in the open arms were calculated as previously described 25 .

Sniff test was conducted as previously described 75 . Olfaction was tested by exposing mice ( n = 13-21) to a small amount of palatable food (Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal; General Mills) once per day for 2 days. Mice were deprived of food overnight before the test. A clean cage was filled with roughly 3 inches of fresh bedding, and the stimulus food was buried in the bedding until it was not visible. Mice were then placed in the cage one at a time and allowed to freely explore. The latency to localize and retrieve the food was measured. All mice retrieved the food within 1 min. Bedding was mixed in between trials and tested mice were placed in a new holding cage until all cage-mates had been tested. After this, all mice were returned to their original cage and ad libitum food access was restored.

Social preference and social memory 91 was performed as described 75 by using a Plexiglas chamber divided into three compartments. The two edge compartments contain an empty wire cup. Mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 hour before the experiment. Stimulus mice were age- and sex- matched C67Bl/6 male mice that were housed in separate areas of the animal facility and had no prior contact with the test mice. Stimulus mice were habituated to the wire cup before testing. For the sociability test, the test mouse was introduced to the middle chamber and allowed to freely move and habituate to all three compartments for 10 min. Then, the mouse was restricted to the middle chamber using the dividers, while a novel object (Lego) was placed under the wire cup in one chamber and an unfamiliar mouse in the other. The test mouse was then allowed to investigate the whole apparatus for 10 min. After, the mouse was again restricted to the middle chamber while the object was replaced by a second, unfamiliar mouse. The test mouse was allowed 10 min to investigate. Data were acquired using the Ethovision system (Noldus) to automatically track motion while manual scoring was used to quantify time spent sniffing the stimuli. Counterbalancing was used to control for potential left-right preferences.

Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v7.0a, and significance was determined at p-value < 0.05. All statistical analyses were two-tailed. Normal distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Grubbs’ test was used to identify and remove outliers. For two-group comparisons with equal variance as determined by the F-test, an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used. Normally distributed data with unequal variance was analyzed with Welch’s correction. Not normally distributed data was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. For analysis across three groups or more, a One-way ANOVA was used. For the analysis of seizure susceptibility, Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison between two groups. For the analysis of seizure susceptibility across three groups, a Chi-squared test with Bonferroni post hoc adjustment was used to calculate adjusted P values to maintain an alpha of 0.05. For the analysis of accelerated rotarod a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used. For Gene Ontology analysis using ENRICHR, FDR values were calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg test in ENRICHR and P values were calculated using Fisher’s exact test in ENRICHR 68 , 69 . All data is shown is represented as vertical dot plots, vertical bar graphs, or XY plots with mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Statistical methods were not used to predetermine the sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. All samples were randomly allocated into treatment groups. Experimenters were blind to genotype whenever possible.
