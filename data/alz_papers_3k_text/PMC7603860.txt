Tau molecular diversity contributes to clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes unrelenting, progressive cognitive impairments, but its course is heterogeneous, with a broad range of rates of cognitive decline 1 . The spread of tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) across the cerebral cortex parallels symptom severity 2 , 3 . We hypothesized that the kinetics of tau spread may vary if the properties of the propagating tau proteins vary across individuals. We carried out biochemical, biophysical, MS and both cell- and animal-based-bioactivity assays to characterize tau in 32 patients with AD. We found striking patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the hyperphosphorylated species of soluble, oligomeric, seed-competent tau. Tau seeding activity correlates with the aggressiveness of the clinical disease, and some post-translational modification (PTM) sites appear to be associated with both enhanced seeding activity and worse clinical outcomes, whereas others are not. These data suggest that different individuals with ‘typical’ AD may have distinct biochemical features of tau. These data are consistent with the possibility that individuals with AD, much like people with cancer, may have multiple molecular drivers of an otherwise common phenotype, and emphasize the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches for slowing clinical progression of AD.

## Methods
Thirty-two human participants with AD were selected from the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Longitudinal Cohort study on the basis of the following criteria: (1) clinically diagnosed with dementia due to probable AD; (2) cognitive status assessed at least three times by a neurologist at the MGH Memory Clinic Unit and scored using CDR-SOB; (3) diagnosis of AD confirmed postmortem by an MGH neuropathologist; (4) Braak Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) stage V or VI as determined by the location of NFTs with a total tau immunostain and Bielchowsky’s silver stain 16 ; and (5) the least possible concurrent pathologies. Age of onset, age at death, postmortem interval, sex and APOE genotype were also collected and are listed in Supplementary Table 1 41 . Additional information on the sample size and data exclusion can be found in the Reporting Summary. We approximated the rates of progression by applying a linear-regression model to the longitudinal CDR-SOB scores (from onset to CDR-SOB = 18, or from onset to the last available score when CDR-SOB = 18 was not reached; Fig. 1b ). Autopsy tissue from human brains were collected at Massachusetts General hospital, with informed consent of patients or their relatives and approval of local institutional review boards.

Human brains were processed as previously described 42 . Briefly, all brains were separated into 2 hemispheres, one of which was postfixed in 10% formalin for 3 weeks, and regions of interest were embedded in paraffin following standard protocols 43 , 44 . Seven-micrometer-thick paraffin-embedded frontal association cortex tissue sections (Brodmann area 8/9) were cut and subsequently placed on slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus slides; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for histological analysis. The contralateral hemisphere was initially sliced coronally at the time of autopsy and 1-cm-thick slabs were immediately flash frozen and stored at −80 °C. Approximately 1 g of frontal cortex was dissected out of the frozen brain section corresponding to Brodmann Area 8/9 and kept at −80 °C until homogenization.

Frozen human tissue (300 mg) was thawed on wet ice and then immediately homogenized in 1,500 μl of PBS + protease inhibitor (Roche) in a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. Tissue was Dounce homogenized with 30 up and down strokes on ice by hand. The homogenate was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and aliquoted to avoid excessive freeze–thaw cycles. A BCA assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce) was performed to determine total protein concentration, and an ELISA (Meso Scale Diagnostics) was performed to determine the concentration of total tau in the samples, following the manufacturer’s protocol.

For in vivo experiments, PBS-soluble brain extracts containing 800 ng of total tau were pelleted at 150,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C in order to sediment seeding species, as previously described 24 . Pellets were subsequently resuspended in 50 μl of 1× PBS and stored at −80 °C until further use.

The in vitro seeding assay has been previously described and widely characterized 10 , 42 . Briefly, the Tau RD P301S FRET Biosensor (ATCC CRL-3275) cells stably expressing the repeat domain of Tau with the p.P301S mutation conjugated to either cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (TauRD-P301S-CFP/YFP) were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM, 10% vol/vol FBS, 0.5% vol/vol penicillin–streptomycin. Additional information on the cell line can be found in the Reporting Summary. Cells were plated on Costar Black, clear-bottom 96-well plates (previously coated with 1:20 poly- d -lysine) at a density of 40,000 cells per well. Brain extracts (8 ng of total tau quantified by total tau ELISA (MSD) per well) were then incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, final concentration 1% vol/vol) in opti-MEM (final volume of 50 μl per well) for 10 min at room temperature before being added to the cells. Each condition was applied in triplicate or quadruplicate. For seeding experiments using anti-tau antibodies, 1 μg of each anti-tau antibody was incubated with the brain extract for 20 min at 37 °C before incubation with lipofectamine. The effect of anti-tau antibodies on tau seeding was then analyzed by normalizing to carry-over samples and input samples.

Tau seeding was subsequently analyzed using flow cytometry or live imaging.

After 24 h, medium was removed, and 50 μl trypsin 1× was added for 7 min at 37 °C. Chilled DMEM + 10% FBS (150 μl) was added to the trypsin, and cells were transferred to 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning). Cells were pelleted at 500 g , resuspended in freshly-made 2% vol/vol paraformaldehyde in PBS (Electron Microscopy Services) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, and pelleted at 500 g . Cells were resuspended in chilled PBS and run on the MACSQuant VYB (Miltenyi) flow cytometer. CFP and FRET were both measured by exciting the cells using the 405-nm laser and reading fluorescence emission at the 405/50-nm and 525/50-nm filters, respectively. To quantify the FRET signal, a bivariate plot of FRET versus the CFP donor was generated, and cells that received control brain extract alone were used to identify the FRET-negative population. Using this gate, the tau seeding value for each well was calculated by multiplying the percentage of FRET-positive cells by the median fluorescence intensity of that FRET-positive population. We analyzed 40,000 events per well. Data were analyzed using the MACSQuantify software (Miltenyi).

Four carry-over samples were used for each plate to normalize across multiple plates run at the same time. Additional information on the gating strategy can be found in the Reporting Summary.

Immediately following addition of brain extract to the cells, the plate was transferred to a BioTek Cytation5 Imaging Multi-Mode Reader, using the Gen5 Image Prime 3.03 software. Cells were kept at 37 °C and were supplied with CO 2 at a concentration of 5%. Green fluorescent protein images of the cells were captured every 30 min for 72 h using the ×20 objective. Four images were taken per well. Images were exported from the Cytation5 Imaging machine for further analysis using Fiji/ImageJ. Images were first converted from individual files into time-series stacks of 145 images, each representing a single field of a single well over the 72-h period. After conversion, stacks were classified on the basis of three attributes: aggregates, cells or background, representing the three main features of each image. Classification was done using the Trainable Weka Segmentation 45 . A classifier model was generated prior to experimentation using a representative set of seven images, each of which were manually classified into aggregates, cells or background. After manually classifying these images, this data were input into a machine-learning-based image-analysis algorithm, consisting of several smoothing and edge-sharpening algorithms. The specific algorithms used for this model classification were Gaussian blur, Hessian, mean, maximum, variance, minimum, median, Laplacian and entropy. The specific type of classifier used was a FastRandomForest (a multi-threaded version of the Random Forest classifier). After the manual implementation the classifier model itself, the classification job and the images were exported to a high-performance cluster developed by the Harvard Medical School Research Computing Group allowing for large dataset analysis. After image classification was completed on the cluster servers, we exported back the images to generate quantitative results. Classification returns an 8-bit grayscale image, with different grayscale values for the pixels classified as cells, aggregates or background ( Supplementary Video 1 ). Using the ‘Analyze Particles’ macro built into Fiji/ImageJ, aggregate and cell qualities were quantitatively measured, including number, size, bounding perimeter, kurtosis and fraction of area occupied. After the quantitative information was determined by Fiji/ImageJ, it was exported and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism version 7 (GraphPad). Both the number of seeds per field and the number of seeds normalized to the area of cells were analyzed, showing similar results. For representation in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1 , a sigmoidal, 4PL non-linear regression in which x is log (concentration) was applied and data were plotted. Plateau values were obtained by averaging the raw data for the last 24 h, and slope values reflected the slope of the linear regression of the lines between 0.5 h and 30 h.

Mixed neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 mouse brains from transgenic mice (B6.Cg- Mapt tm1.1(MAPT)Itl Tg(MAPT)8cPdav), which are the offspring of a cross between hTau mice 18 and an hTau tau knock-in model resulting in a model overexpressing several human tau isoforms (around 6-fold overexpression of human tau), knocked out for the mouse Mapt gene and on a pure C57BL/6 background. In contrast with the hTau mice, these mice don’t carry any copy of the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. All animal care, housing, and experiments were performed in compliance with guidelines established by the Merck institutional animal care and use committee and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Cortical tissues were dissected and treated with papain-based dissociation mixture in HBSS media (Hyclone) for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing, cells were mechanically dissociated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. The cell suspension was filtered with 70-μm and 40-μm filters (Corning) and centrifuged at 250 g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM. The cells were plated in 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates and incubated in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . After 3 h, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium (Neurobasal, 2% B27, 0.25 mM GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 10 mM sodium pyruvate) and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C. After 10 d in vitro (DIV10), cells were treated with PBS-extracted human brain extracts (containing 100 ng ml −1 Tau monomer equivalent concentration based on BT2/HT7 AlphaLISA; see below for detailed procedure) diluted in Neurobasal medium. After 3 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for a further 11 d.

At DIV21, the cells were fixed with Prefer (glyoxal-based fixing solution; Anatech) supplemented with 1% vol/vol Triton X-100 to wash out soluble proteins (15 min at room temperature (RT)). Primary antibodies against AT8 (monoclonal, 1/1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), MAP2 (polyclonal, Biolegend, 1/10,000) and NeuN (polyclonal, Millipore, 1/1,000), diluted with blocking buffer, were added for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, secondary antibodies against Alexa Fluor (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 from Thermo Fisher Scientific, anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 647 from Thermo Fisher Scientific, anti-guinea-pig Alexa Fluor 405 from Abcam) diluted in blocking buffer were added for 1 h at RT.

For the time-course experiment ( Extended Data Fig. 2a , b ), human brain PBS extracts were incubated with 1% sarkosyl and 10% sucrose, and then were pelleted at 100,000 g . The pellets were resuspended in PBS and sonicated before being added to the primary neurons at DIV8 at a total protein concentration of 75 μg ml −1 . Cells were then fixed and stained as indicated above after 1 h, 1 d, 2 d and 7 d following addition of brain extracts.

Images were acquired using the Phenix Opera imaging system (PerkinElmer) and analyzed using the Columbus 2.5.2 HCS image-analysis system (PerkinElmer). NeuN-positive nuclei were detected using the ‘find nuclei’ analysis module. The total intensities of AT8-positive tau and total AT8 spots were identified and calculated using ‘find region’ and ‘find spots’ modules, respectively. Total MAP2 intensity was calculated using the ‘find region’ module.

Two-month-old PS19 mice (B6;C3-Tg(Prnp-MAPT*P301S)PS19Vle/J) overexpressing the human 1N4R isoform of tau with a p.P301S mutation were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. After deeply anesthetizing the mice of either sex with 1.5% (vol/vol) isoflurane, they were immobilized in a stereotaxic frame and brain extracts were injected at the following coordinates from the bregma suture (Anteroposterior, −2.5 mm; mediolateral, ±2 mm; dorsoventral, −2 and −0.8 mm) with a Hamilton syringe under aseptic conditions. Injections consisted of 1.5 μl brain extract from 10 human participants ( n = 5 animals per participant), which were injected bilaterally at a flow rate of 0.1 μl min −1 . All injected animals were monitored throughout the surgery and postsurgery, until full recovery. After surgery, the skin was sutured and an analgesic was administered.

Two months postinjection, mice were euthanized with CO 2 and transcardially perfused first with cold 0.9% PBS followed by cold 4% PFA for 10 min. The brains were immediately removed, fixed for 48 h in 4% PFA and placed in 30% sucrose for 24 h. Coronal sections (40 μm thick) were sliced using a freezing microtome and were collected at 400 μm intervals for immunohistochemical analysis. All animal care, housing and experiments were performed in compliance with guidelines established by the Massachusetts General Hospital institutional animal care and use committee and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Seven-micrometer-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human brain tissue sections from the frontal association cortex (Brodmann area 8/9) were allowed to air dry for at least 24 h after being cut, and were immunostained for β-amyloid, total tau, CD68 (activated phagocytic microglia) and GFAP (reactive astrocytes). β-amyloid slides were pretreated for 20 minutes with an EDTA, pH 9.0 as epitope retrieval step, whereas CD68 slides were pre-treated for 30 minutes with a citrate, pH 6.0 epitope retrieval step. All slides were then stained in a Leica Bond RX Autostainer (Leica) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, slides were blocked using the peroxide block solution (Leica) for 20 min at RT, followed by an incubation in primary antibodies for 45 min (β-amyloid and CD68) or 35 min (tau and GFAP) at the following antibody concentrations: total tau (Dako, polyclonal), 1:6,000; β-amyloid (Dako, monoclonal), 1:600 μl; CD68 (Dako, monoclonal), 1:500; and GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, monoclonal), 1:20,000. Slides were then incubated for 10 min with the Post Primary Solution (Leica) containing secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse IgG) before being washed 3 times for 2 min at RT with the BOND Wash Solution (Leica) and incubation for 8 min at RT with Polymer Solution (Leica) containing anti-rabbit polymeric-horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Slides were washed 2 times for 2 min with the Bond Wash solution and then incubated in 2 successive 30-s baths of DAB part 1 (Leica) and DAB part 2 (Leica) containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate. Slides were finally incubated with a hematoxylin solution (Leica) for 10 min (β-amyloid and CD68) or 15 min (tau and GFAP) at RT. Slides were then transferred into water and dehydrated by 10 quick incubations (around 1-s long) into 2 baths of 70% ethanol, 2 baths of 95% ethanol, 2 baths of 100% ethanol and 2 baths of 100% xylene. Slides were then cover slipped with Permount Mounting Medium (Fisher Scientific) and scanned using an Olympus VS120-S6-W virtual slide microscope, at a magnification of ×40. Scanned slide images were then analyzed in Olympus’ cellSens analysis software. Regions of interest were drawn to capture as much cortical ribbon as was available. Once regions of interest were drawn, HSV-thresholding was performed manually to obtain the burden of targeted pathologies. Slides for all individuals within one antibody condition were stained at the same time and microscopy exposure times as well as analysis thresholds were kept stable for all individuals within one antibody condition. Data were then transferred to GraphPad Prism version 7 for further statistical analysis.

For mouse studies, 40-μm-thick coronal free-floating sections were washed in TBS and endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 0.3% H 2 O 2 . Sections were then blocked with 3% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in 0.25% Triton X-100 TBS and then incubated with mouse monoclonal AT8-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. On day 2, sections were washed in TBS and incubated in streptavidin–horseradish-peroxidase-containing ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Fresh diaminobenzidine was prepared from a tablet (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with tissue for 45 s to precipitate. Sections were mounted onto slides, dehydrated in ascending ethanol/xylene and then coverslipped with Cytoseal XYL (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

After immunohistochemistry, stereological quantifications were performed using the Computer Assisted Stereological Toolbox (CAST, version 2.3.1.5, Olympus America). AT8-positive neurons were counted around the injection sites in all sections from bregma −1 to −2.7 mm in the hippocampi and in the cortex overlaying the hippocampi (mainly visual, auditory, retrosplenial, posterior parietal association and primary somatosensory cortex). From each section, 10% of the total area of the cortex was counted using a randomized algorithm to yield count per mm 2 . All counting was conducted while researchers were blinded to experimental conditions.

Cortical thickness was measured in immunostained sections as previously described 46 . Briefly, the image-analysis software CAST, mounted on an upright BX51 Olympus microscope (Olympus) and coupled with a motorized stage and a charge-coupled device camera, was used to randomly sample the cortex of the entire section and measure the full thickness of the cortex. The measurements of full cortical thickness from 20 random sites were averaged.

We performed four versions of the AlphaLISA sandwich immunoassays with different acceptor bead antibodies/biotinylated detection antibody combinations: Total tau: acceptor antibody BT2 (monoclonal), biotinylated antibody HT7 (bHT7; monoclonal); AT8-phosphorylated-tau: acceptor antibody HT7, biotinylated antibody AT8 (monoclonal); HF6-phosphorylated tau: acceptor antibody PHF6 (monoclonal), biotinylated antibody HT7; Oligomeric tau: acceptor antibody HT7, biotinylated antibody HT7.

Total tau: acceptor antibody BT2 (monoclonal), biotinylated antibody HT7 (bHT7; monoclonal);

AT8-phosphorylated-tau: acceptor antibody HT7, biotinylated antibody AT8 (monoclonal);

HF6-phosphorylated tau: acceptor antibody PHF6 (monoclonal), biotinylated antibody HT7;

Oligomeric tau: acceptor antibody HT7, biotinylated antibody HT7.

Beads (1:200 dilution) and biotin-detector antibodies (1:266 dilution) were diluted into 1× AlphaLISA assay buffer (PerkinElmer) and placed into a 384-well Opti-plate (PerkinElmer) at 20 μl per well. Five microliters of each sample were then added. The HT7–bAT8, HT7–bHT7 and PHF6–bHT7 assays were all run with undiluted fraction assay input material. The BT2–bHT7 t-tau assay was run with 1:100 diluted SEC fraction assay input material in 1× PBS 0.2% Tween 20. The plate was then covered with aluminum sealing tape, centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min and incubated with shaking overnight at 550 r.p.m., 4 °C. After incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min. Two micrograms of streptavidin-donor beads (PerkinElmer) diluted in 1× AlphaLISA assay buffer (final volume, 25 μl per well) were added to each well. The plate was then covered with aluminum sealing tape, centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min and incubated with shaking for 30 min at 550 r.p.m., RT. After incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min and immediately read on a PHERAstar (BMG Labtech) 1.11 plate reader S/N 471–0028, software version 3.00 R2, at 680-nm and 615-nm wavelengths for excitation and detection, respectively. The resulting raw data in the BT2 total-tau assay were transformed to ng ml −1 values based on the standard curve using the GraphPad Prism version 7.02 and 4PL format curve interpolation.

Semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) was performed as previously described 9 , 26 . Briefly, brain extract normalized to contain 340 ng total tau was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel with Laemmli buffer (20 mmol l −1 Tris-base, 200 mmol l −1 glycine and 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The gel was run on ice at 35 V for 16 h and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane overnight in TBS using filter paper and capillary action. The membrane was blocked in TBS containing 0.25% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody (1:1,000; Dako). Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was applied in blocking solution on day 2 and was detected using chemiluminescent horseradish-peroxidase substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and film (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For quantification, grayscale images were scanned and imported into Fiji/ImageJ. Using the gel quantification densitometry tool, the gel was separated into 14 bands (bins) of equal size that were all quantified and plotted.

For liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), for each human participant, 50 μl of TBS soluble brain extract containing 75 μg of total protein was pelleted at 150,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C in order to sediment seeding species as previously described 24 . Pellets were subsequently resuspended in 1× PBS. Resuspended pellets were diluted in 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and were processed separately using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) 47 on filters with a 10-kDa molecular-weight cutoff (Millipore). Samples were reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated using 1% acrylamide 48 . Protein mixtures were digested with 100 μl of 10 μg ml −1 trypsin (sequencing-grade-modified trypsin) overnight at 37 °C. Peptide solutions were then acidified with formic acid (2% vol/vol), desalted using C18 Microspin columns (Nest Group) and vacuum-dried overnight. Peptides were reconstituted in sample buffer (5% formic acid, 5% acetonitrile (ACN)) and analyzed in random order on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a LC system consisting of a micro-autosampler AS2 and a nanoflow high-performance LC (HPLC) pump (Eksigent) using a capflow PicoChip column (150 μm × 10 cm Acquity BEH C18 column, 1.7-μm particle size, 130-Å pore size; New Objective) during a 120-min gradient from 98% buffer A (0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid in HPLC-grade H 2 O), 2% buffer B (0.2% (vol/vol) formic acid in ACN) to 70% buffer A, 30% buffer B at a flowrate of 1 μl min −1 . The PicoChip was heated to 50 °C and mounted directly at the inlet to the mass spectrometer. The Q Exactive was operated in positive-ion mode, with a data-dependent acquisition top 12 method. The first spectrometer (MS1) scan settings were as follows: mass-to-charge ( m/z ) range, 375–1,400; resolution 70,000 at m/z 400; AGC target, 3 × 10 6 ; max IT, 60 ms. The second spectrometer (MS2) scan settings were: resolution 17,500 at m/z 400; AGC target, 5 × 10 4 ; max IT, 100 ms; isolation window, m/z 1.6; NCE, 27; underfill ration, 2% (intensity threshold 1 × 10 4 ); charge state exclusion unassigned, 1, >8; peptide match preferred; exclude isotopes on; dynamic exclusion, 25 s.

To identify phosphorylation sites on tau, raw files generated by Xcalibur were analyzed using MaxQuant 49 software version 1.6.5.0 searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein sequence human proteome database (October 2017) including isoform entries. The following settings were applied: digestion- trypsin with up to 2 missed cleavages; mass tolerances, 20 parts per million (ppm) for the first peptide search, 4.5 ppm for the second search; and fragment ion mass tolerance, 20 ppm. Propionamide on cysteine was set as fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine (M), N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. The false-discovery rate was set to 1% on peptide-spectrum match, protein and site decoy fraction levels, and was determined by searching a reverse database. For all other search parameters, the default settings were used. In order to quantify modified peptides in each sample even in the absence of fragmentation of the precursor, an MS1 filtering approach using Skyline was used. A Skyline document creating entries for modified peptides representing phosphorylation sites identified on tau using MaxQuant was created. In cases where multiple coeluting phosphoisomers of the same peptide were identified by MaxQuant (Ser198/Ser199/Ser202, Ser400/Thr403/Ser403), they could not be distinguished on the MS1 level and therefore were treated as one entity. To generate a spectral library to facilitate peak identification, Mascot 2.6 was used to search ten individual data files with the following settings: fixed propionamide on cysteine, phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine, N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. Peptide mass tolerance 20 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was 20 millimass units. The Human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (October 2017) including isoforms was used with specific trypsin digestion and a maximum two missed cleavages. The results files were downloaded from Mascot and imported as a peptide search in Skyline to generate a spectral library using the DDA with MS1 filtering workflow 50 . The following peptides were selected in the Skyline document: pThr181-TPPAPKT[+80 Da] PPSSGEPPK, pSer198/pSer199/pSer202-SGYSS[+80 Da]PGSPGTPGSR, pThr217-TPSLPT[+80 Da]PPTR, pThr231-VAVVRT[+80 Da] PPKSPSSAK, pThr231 and pThr235-VAVVRT[+80]PPKS[+80 Da]PSSAK, pSer262-IGS[+80 Da]TENLK pSer400/pThr403/perS404-SPVVSGDTS[+80 Da] PR, unmodified-LQTAPVPMPDLK, unmodified-C[+71 Da] GSLGNIHHKPGGGQVEVK, unmodified-IGSLDNITHVPGGGNK. All raw files were imported in Skyline extracting chromatograms within 5 min of Mascot IDs. Extracted ion chromatograms were examined and peak boundaries were manually adjusted for each sample and peptide using retention time, mass error (<10 ppm), isotope dot product (>0.8), fragment ions and local peak landscape to guide peak picking. The sum of the peak area of the three unmodified peptides was used to normalize the modified peptide peak area to total tau. Owing to a quality-control issue on the mass spectrometry data, participant no. 9 was excluded from all analyses. Analyses of the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data were performed blinded.

Brain soluble extracts were separated by SEC as previously described 24 on single Superdex200 10/300GL columns (no. 17-5175-01, GE Healthcare) in PBS (no. P3813, Sigma-Aldrich, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min −1 , with an AKTA purifier 10 (GE Healthcare). Each brain extract was diluted with PBS to contain 6,000 ng of human tau to a final volume of 500 μl, which was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter and then loaded onto an SEC column. Fractions of 500 μl were retrieved, analyzed by AlphaLISA and subjected to the in vitro seeding assay.

Proteinase K digestion was carried out as previously described 14 . Briefly, brain extracts were diluted in proteinase K buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2, 3 mM DTT and 2 M urea) and proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the appropriate concentration (0–2.5 μg ml −1 ). Samples were incubated in proteinase K buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The digestion was halted with 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich). NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (4× concentration) (Invitrogen) and 10× NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen) were added to 5 μg of digested extracts, boiled for 10 min at 95 °C and run on 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS–PAGE (Invitrogen) in MES buffer (Invitrogen). The gels were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Blots were incubated with anti-total tau polyclonal (anti-C-terminus tau polyclonal, 1:2,000; Dako) and anti-phosphorylated tau (p-tau Ser396/Ser404 PHF1 polyclonal, 1:2,000; kindly donated by P. Davies) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times for 10 min with TBS-T and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IRDye680 (1:1,000) for 1.5 h at room temperature and imaged on the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). For quantification, images were converted to grayscale in FIJI/ImageJ. Using the gel quantification densitometry tool, the full lane of tau was quantified, as well as tau fragments under 50 kDa and the monomeric tau (band from 50 kDa to 70 kDa). Quantifications were normalized to the full-length band of tau at 0 μg ml −1 of proteinase K of each sample to take into account the amount of total tau in the sample.

Tau immunodepletions were performed using the following antibodies: Tau-12 (monoclonal, Biolegend), HT7 (monoclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Tau-46 (monoclonal, Cell signaling), AT270 (monoclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific), AT8 (monoclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific), pS262 (monoclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and PHF1 (monoclonal, kind gift from P. Davies). The negative control for tau binding used was a random human immunoglobulin G (IgG). Additional information on antibodies can be found in the Reporting Summary. Tau immunodepletions from brain extracts were carried out using the Dynabeads Protein G Immunoprecipitation Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications (Invitrogen). Dynabeads (750 μg) were resuspended by rotating for 5 min. The supernatant was removed while the beads were immobilized by a magnetic field. Beads were resuspended in 100 μl PBS with 5 μg antibody and incubated for 10 min at RT with rotation. To remove the supernatant, we pipetted it out while the bead–antibody complexes were immobilized by a magnetic field. Bead–antibody complexes were resuspended in 100 μl PBS. The supernatant was removed while the bead–antibody complexes were immobilized by a magnetic field. Human brain extracts (normalized to a final total amount of 800 ng of tau protein) were diluted in PBS to a final volume of 100 μl, and were then added to the beads and gently homogenized by pipetting and were incubated for 10 min at RT with rotation. Supernatant was retrieved while the bead–antibody–antigen complexes were immobilized by a magnetic field. This supernatant was used subsequently for the in vitro FRET seeding assay to determine the amount of seeding reduction achieved by tau immunodepletion (1 μl of supernatant per well in the FRET-based-biosensor assay). Bead–antibody–antigen complexes were washed 3 times using 100 μl PBS for each wash and resuspended in 100 μL 1× LDS sample buffer/1× reducing agent/distilled water. After a 5-min incubation at 95 °C, beads were removed using a magnetic field and supernatant was collected and stored for further analyses.

Kinetic affinities of anti-tau antibodies were generated by Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare), a SPR-based technology, as previously described 51 . Briefly, a C1 sensor chip (GE Healthcare, BR-1005–35) was directly immobilized via amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare, BR-1000–50) with low density of human tau-441 protein (Sigma-Aldrich T0576) with 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% P20 pH7.4 (1× HBS-EP+) running buffer. Human tau-441 protein was diluted to 0.5 μg ml −1 in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 and injected at 10 μl min −1 twice for 15 s each over Flow Cell 2 that had been activated for 7 min with EDC–NHS per the amine coupling kit instructions. The immobilized human tau-441 surface was neutralized with ethanolamine–HCl for 7 min. The reference surface, Flow Cell 1, was similarly activated with EDC–NHS and neutralized with ethanolamine–HCl but did not receive the human tau-441 protein. Serially diluted anti-tau antibodies were injected at 30 μl min −1 over the human tau-441 surface for 4 min, followed by dissociation in 1× HBS-EP+ for 7 min. The human tau-441 sensor surface was regenerated with two 5-s pulses of 10 mM glycine pH 1.5 for 5 s at 100 μl min −1 . Binding kinetics were analyzed with Biacore T100 Evaluation Software using the 1:1 binding model.

DNA was extracted from cerebellum samples from all 32 study participants plus one control individual using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit All DNA samples were sent to Novagene, and the 17 that successfully passed quality control (from participant nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29 and 30, and the control). A total amount of 1.0 μg genomic DNA per sample was used as input material for the DNA sample preparation. Sequencing libraries were generated using Agilent SureSelect Human All ExonV6 kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, fragmentation was carried out by hydrodynamic shearing system (Covaris) to generate 180- to 280-bp fragments. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities, and enzymes were removed. After adenylation of the 3′ ends of DNA fragments, adapter oligonucleotides were ligated. DNA fragments with ligated adapter molecules on both ends were selectively enriched in a PCR reaction. Captured libraries were enriched in a PCR reaction to add index tags to prepare for hybridization. Products were purified using AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter) and were quantified using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The qualified libraries were fed into Illumina sequencers after pooling, according to effective concentration and expected data volume. The original data obtained from the high-throughput sequencing platforms were transformed to sequenced reads by base calling. Raw data were recorded in a FASTQ file which contains sequenced reads and corresponding sequencing quality information.

Basic statistics and plots have been generated using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad). Unless otherwise stated, two-tailed Spearman r non-parametric correlations were used to correlate different variables obtained from single individuals. The Spearman correlation coefficient r and the P value are indicated in the figures. For the proteinase K resistance assay and the in vivo seeding assay, the quantifications were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test with a Tukey’s multiple-comparisons post hoc test.

## Extended Data
a , Tau seeding was quantified by live imaging over 72 h of FRET biosensor cells exposed to PBS extracts of the 32 human AD brains. This process is divided into three phases: a nucleation/lag phase followed by the exponential polymerization/elongation phase and ending by a plateau phase. Samples were normalized to total tau levels before being added to the seeding assay and the number of aggregates obtained was normalized to both positive and negative controls. A sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log(concentration) nonlinear regression was applied before plotting the data b , Tau seeding dose response was investigated in two of these AD brain extracts. Tau seeding was quantified with 8 ng of total tau in the sample (dose used for Fig. 2d and in panel A) but also with 0.08 ng, 0.8 ng, 4 ng, 16 ng and 40 ng to demonstrate the dose dependence of the plateau phase and the ceiling effect of the assay. c , Statistically significant two-tailed Spearman’s rank nonparametric correlation between the plateau value for each of the 32 AD brain extracts measured in this manner and the seeding value obtained on the FRET biosensor assay by flow cytometry ( Fig. 2b ). d , Statistically significant two-tailed Spearman’s rank nonparametric correlation between the values of the plateau and of the slope for the 32 AD brains.

Two-sided Spearman’s rank nonparametric correlation test was used and r coefficient and p value are indicated on the plots. n = 31 individual human subjects.

The relationship between age of onset and rate of progression undoubtedly has many contributors, hence it is not surprising that some relationships are not evident statistically in a relatively small sample that was not selected to examine this question. As expected and previously established 2 , 3 , 55 , 56 , Rate of disease clinical progression as indicated by the slope of the linearized CDR-SOB score trajectories and age of symptom onset as quantified in Fig. 1b , c significantly correlates with tau burden from Supplementary Fig. 8a,b (respectively a , and b ) but also oligomeric tau levels from Fig. 3a (respectively c , and d , p = 0.057) and 2 epitopes of tau hyperphosphorylation: PHF6, from Supplementary Fig. 4b (respectively e , and f , p = 0.051) and AT8 from Supplementary Fig. 4a (respectively g , and h ) in the 32 subjects of this study’s cohort 54 . i , As recently described and probably not independent of the age of onset, tau seeding correlates with age at death 54 .
