# Title
RNA timestamps identify the age of single molecules in RNA sequencing

# Abstract
Current approaches to single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide only limited information about the dynamics of gene expression. Here we present RNA timestamps, a method for inferring the age of individual RNAs in RNA-seq data by exploiting RNA editing. To introduce timestamps, we tag RNA with a reporter motif consisting of multiple MS2 binding sites that recruit the adenosine deaminase ADAR2 fused to an MS2 capsid protein. ADAR2 binding to tagged RNA causes A-to-I edits to accumulate over time, allowing the age of the RNA to be inferred with hour-scale accuracy. By combining observations of multiple timestamped RNAs driven by the same promoter, we can determine when the promoter was active. We demonstrate that the system can infer the presence and timing of multiple past transcriptional events. Finally, we apply the method to cluster single cells according to the timing of past transcriptional activity. RNA timestamps will allow the incorporation of temporal information into RNA-seq workflows.

## Methods
All plasmids were constructed using either restriction cloning using restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs and the NEB Quick Ligation kit (M2200L) or the In-Fusion HD cloning enzyme mix (Clontech, 638911). Plasmids were grown in E. cloni 10G Chemically Competent Cells (Lucigen, 60107–1) and were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eton Bioscience). All plasmids ( Supplementary Table 1 ) are deposited on Addgene.

Owing to high repetition present in the RNA editing templates, inserts for plasmids 76, 147, 148, 149 and 187 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) were ordered as sense and antisense ultramer oligonucleotides, which were annealed to each other before cloning. Plasmid 76 was cloned by inserting RNA templates (A_Short, B_Short, C, D and E) into the 3′ UTR of an iRFP transcript expressed under a UbC promoter in a second-generation lentivirus backbone using SphI and ClaI. Subsequently, this plasmid was modified by the addition of a flavivirus xrRNA in the 5′ UTR. Templates A_Short and B_Short were then extended by inserting another pair of annealed ultramers on the 5′ side of A_Short and B_Short using SphI and MluI. The resulting templates are designated A and B. To generate plasmids 147, 148, 149 and 183 (as used in the paper), templates A and B were then moved into different backbones and different promoters by restriction cloning or by Gibson assembly with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the timestamp template region. Template A is used throughout the paper; template B is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 for comparison.

All cell cultures were lysed with 600 μl of buffer RLT Plus from the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74136) and were pipetted up and down vigorously to homogenize. RNA was then purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, following the instructions from the manufacturer. Subsequently, 11 μl of purified RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 18090050) and a barcoded version of SGR-174 ( Supplementary Table 2 ), following the protocol from the manufacturer. Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were then purified using Agencourt Ampure XP beads at a 1:1 dilution (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Some portion of the eluent, typically 25%, was then analyzed by PCR using P5 and a barcoded version of SGR-176 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) and the Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB, M0492L) with the following settings: 30 s of 98 °C denaturation; then 25–30 cycles of 10-s denaturation at 98 °C; 20 s of annealing at 70 °C; and then 25 s of extension at 72 °C. PCR reactions were then pooled and run on a gel, and a 400-bp band was extracted using the NucleoSpin PCR Cleanup Kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740609.250). The concentration of DNA in the resulting eluent was determined via a Qubit 2 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was then adjusted to 4 nM for sequencing. The read structure is shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 .

Sequencing was performed using NextSeq Mid Output 300 cycle kits (Illumina, FC-404–2004), MiSeq 300 cycle v2 kits (MS-102–2002) or MiSeq 600 cycle v3 kits (MS-102–3003), with at least 80-bp read 1 and 185-bp read 2, with 8-bp index 1 and 15-bp index 2.

Except in the case of the single-cell experiments, HEK293FT and 3T3 cells were plated in 24-well plates. Cells were grown in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10566016) and supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122) and 10% certified Tet system-approved FBS (Clontech, 631101). Transfections were performed using the TransIT-X2 system (Mirus, MIR 6000), following the manufacturer’s instructions.

For doxycycline experiments, HEK and 3T3 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 300 ng of plasmid 147 or 148, 100 ng of pCMV Tet3G from the Tet-on 3G system (Clontech, 631168) and 100 ng of plasmids 116v1, 116v5 or 116v6. In the experiments for Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3 , they were transfected with both 147 and 148 and received 150 ng of each plasmid. At least 12 h after transfection, cells were stimulated by adding doxycycline to a final concentration of 1 μg ml −1 , followed by gentle mixing or swirling of the plate. Subsequently, transcription was halted by adding actinomycin D to a final concentration of 1 μg ml −1 in the same medium. After waiting for the experimental time period, cells were lysed using Buffer RLT Plus, and libraries were prepared as described above.

For experiments in Fig. 3c – g and Supplementary Fig. 4 , 3T3s were transfected with 300 ng of plasmid 149, 100 ng of plasmid 133 and 100 ng of plasmid 116v5. For conditions in which cells were transfected with both plasmid 147 and plasmid 149, they received 100 ng each of plasmids 149, 147, pCMV Tet3G, 133 and 116v5. Cells were stimulated with a blue LED (Thorlabs, M455L2) with a total power of 200 μW cm −2 . The LED was turned on for 1 h and was subsequently turned off. After the LED was turned off, the cells were wrapped in foil to prevent accidental light exposure. Cells were then lysed after the experimental time period.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 , cells were stimulated with blue light for 1 h and were then placed in darkness for 7 h. While still in darkness, cells were then stimulated with doxycycline as described above. After 1 h in doxycycline, cells were lysed.

As shown in Fig. 3c – g , cells were stimulated with blue light for 1 h and were then placed in darkness for 4 h. While still in darkness, cells were then stimulated with doxycycline as described above. After 1 h in doxycycline, cells were lysed.

For the experiment shown in Fig. 1d – f , cells were stimulated as above and were lysed at the following timepoints: 0 h (that is, immediately before adding doxycycline), 0.5 h after adding doxycycline, 1 h after adding doxycycline (that is, immediately before adding actinomycin D), 2 h after adding doxycycline, 3 h after adding doxycycline, 4 h after adding doxycycline, 5 h after adding doxycycline, 6 h after adding doxycycline, 7 h after adding doxycycline, 8 h after adding doxycycline, 9 h after adding doxycycline, 10 h after adding doxycycline, 11 h after adding doxycycline and 12 h after adding doxycycline. Each timepoint consisted of three replicates. On a separate occasion, we collected three replicates at 2.5 h after adding doxycycline and 4.5 h after adding doxycycline, and these timepoints functioned as our test timepoints in Supplementary Fig. 3 . The data from Fig. 1d – f were further used in Figs. 2 and 3a , b .

For all experiments involving single cells, HEK cell cultures were prepared; transfected with 100 ng of pAAV-CAG-GFP (Addgene 37825), 200 ng of plasmid 147, 100 ng of plasmid 116v5 and 100 ng of pCMV Tet3G; stimulated with doxycycline; and then silenced with actinomycin D as described above. The three induction conditions were as follows: cells in condition 1 were left in doxycycline for 1 h before lysis; cells in condition 2 were silenced with actinomycin D after 1 h and then left for 3 h; and cells in condition 3 were silenced with actinomycin D after 1 h and then left for 7 h. Subsequently, cells were treated with trypsin (Life Technologies, 25300054). After trypsinization, cells were centrifuged at 850 g , washed in cold PBS and then resuspended in cold PBS. Then, 96-well plates were prepared, with each well containing a solution of 0.2% Triton-X with 2 U μl −1 of RNAse inhibitor. Individual cells were sorted into the wells of this well plate using a MoFlo Astrios EQ flow cytometer. After sorting, the well plate was sealed, centrifuged and then placed at −80 °C overnight.

For the analysis in Fig. 4a – c , cells in condition 2 received plasmid 147B1, whereas cells in condition 3 received plasmid 147B3. The two populations of cells were mixed after trypsinization and sorted together. By contrast, cells in condition 1 received plasmid 147B1 and were sorted separately from the others.

Library preparation for the single cells proceeded as follows. Plates containing single cells were thawed, and 7 μl of nuclease-free water was added to the single cells to bring the total volume up to 11 μl. Subsequently, RT was performed using SuperScript IV and the SGR-174 RT primers, as in the case of the bulk samples, with the following modifications. RT primers were distributed so that each cell at a given timepoint received an RT primer with a different barcode. In addition, for each timepoint, we performed two no-template RT reactions. Finally, after the 50 °C step in the SuperScript IV protocol, we cooled the samples to 37 °C and added 20 U of exonuclease 1 (NEB, M0293S) to the reaction to remove excess primers. Samples then remained at 37 °C for 10 min before proceeding to the 80 °C heat inactivation step. After RT, the RT reactions for all cells and the two no-template controls at a given timepoint were pooled and cleaned with Ampure XP beads at a 1:1 dilution and were then analyzed by PCR using the same protocol as for the bulk samples. Cells were pooled before PCR as a way of reducing the number of cycles necessary to achieve amplification. We excluded cells if they received fewer than 150 reads or if the most common RNA barcode represented fewer than 80% of the total de-duplicated reads, which would indicate index swapping between cells.

For experiments involving 10x single cells, as in Fig. 4d – f , cells in the 1-h condition were induced with doxycycline 1 h before 10x preparation; cells in the 2-h condition were induced with doxycycline 2 h before 10x preparation and silenced with actinomycin D 1 h later and left for 1 h; and cells in the 4-h condition were induced with doxycycline 4 h before 10x preparation, silenced with actinomycin D after 1 h and then left for 3 h. Cells were then treated with trypsin (Life Technologies, 25300054), spun down at 500 g , washed in cold PBS and then resuspended in cold PBS with 0.04% wt/vol BSA. Cell concentration was counted, and the appropriate volume of cells was added to a 10x reaction for a targeted cell recovery of 2,000 cells. The reaction was run through a 10x chip according to the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell protocol. After the droplet generation step, the reaction was transferred to a PCR strip tube and RT, post-RT cleanup and complementary DNA (cDNA) amplification were completed after the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell protocol. After cDNA cleanup, 1–5 μl of the cDNA product was analyzed by PCR with Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0535S), using a barcoded version of SGR-176 and a version of the 10x Genomics cDNA primer that included a P5 addition, with the following settings: 30 s of 98 °C denaturation; then 15–20 cycles of 10-s denaturation at 98 °C and 20 s of annealing at 63 °C; and then 25 s of extension at 72 °C. The rest of the cDNA product was saved for the remainder of the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell protocol. The PCR product was then purified with Ampure beads at a 1:1 dilution and then adjusted to a concentration of 4 nM for sequencing. The libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq with the following read structure: 28 Read 1, 8 Index 1, 8 Index 2 and 200 Read 2. The number of editing sites sequenced per timestamp is fewer, as only Sequencing Read 2 is used for timestamps.

The alignment and analysis pipeline for sequencing data is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 7 . Analysis of sequencing data was performed using custom MATLAB code (MATLAB 2017a). Briefly, in the case of single-cell data, we first performed de-duplication using a 9-bp unique molecular identifier on the RT primer (oligo SGR-174). Other data sets were not de-duplicated. Reads were then filtered to ensure that they had the minimum necessary read length (67 bases on Read 1 and 184 bases on Read 2). Note that Read 1 was on the RT primer, so Read 1 reads the reverse complement of the RNA sequence. Thus, the expected mutation was A to G on Read 2 and T to C on Read 1. Alignment was performed using all bases that were not As on Read 2 or that were not Ts on Read 1. Reads were considered to be aligned to the template if 95% of the non-A (for Read 2) or non-T (for Read 1) bases matched the template. Furthermore, we required 90% of the bases that were expected to be As on Read 2 or Ts on Read 1 to have Q-scores greater than 27 ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ); reads that failed to achieve this threshold were discarded.

Finally, we required that all reads have at least one edit in Read 1 and at least one edit in Read 2 for analysis. We implemented this requirement because it appeared to eliminate several artifacts that we occasionally observed in our data. For example, each well would sometimes have different (large) numbers of RNAs with zero edits or one edit, which would confound attempts to infer timing by gradient descent. As a consequence of this requirement, all of the histograms of edits per RNA presented in this paper appear to show only very few RNAs with fewer than ~12 edits. There are ~12 bases in template A, all of which are on Read 2, that are edited much more quickly than any bases on Read 1. These are of the form UAG and all form bulges in the RNA secondary structure, which are thought to encourage editing by ADAR. Exclusion of RNAs with zero edits on Read 1 or Read 2 predominantly limits the analysis to RNAs that are already fully edited at all 12 of those As, thus causing all RNAs to have at least 12 edits. RNAs with fewer than 12 edits might be useful for inferring transcriptional dynamics on the order of minutes, which we observed in preliminary experiments not presented here.

When analyzing RNA editing distributions generated in 3T3s using a gradient descent algorithm with basis vectors derived from HEK293 cells (as in Fig. 3 ), we included a further calibration step before analysis, as follows. First, we generated a timestamp library from 3T3 cells that were transfected with the doxycycline timestamp system, induced with doxycycline for 1 h and then lysed. We then calculated the mean number A of edits per RNA for cells in the 1-h HEK cell induction data set and the mean number B of edits per RNA in the 1-h 3T3 cell induction data set and multiplied the number of edits in subsequent 3T3 data by the ratio A/B. This procedure was done because we observed that the editing rate was uniformly higher in 3T3 data than in the corresponding HEK cell data, for reasons that were not determined.

The exponential model in Supplementary Fig. 3 was implemented using custom code in Python (Python 3.6) as follows. For each editable position i on the template, we assume that the likelihood of base i being edited follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ i , to be estimated from the data. Assuming an instantaneous pulse of transcriptional activity at time t = 0, the fraction of edited bases for position i , y i , can be modelled as the cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution: Y i ( t ) = 1 − e − λ i t

To more accurately capture the experimental setup, we model y i as an underlying process, which is exponential, but with start time uniformly distributed in [0, t stop ], where t = 0 represents when doxycycline is added to the cells, and t stop is the time at which actinomycin D was added to the cells. Specifically, we fit a function of the form y i ( t ) = { 1 − 1 − e − λ i t λ i t if t ≤ t stop 1 − e − λ i ( t − t stop ) − e − λ i t λ i t stop if t > t stop where t stop was 1 h, and λ i was fit to the data using nonlinear least squares. This function was fit for times t ≥ 1.5 h, because the editing distributions for earlier timepoints are strongly affected by populations of RNA present before doxycycline addition. For the analysis in Supplementary Fig. 3 , analysis was then performed using only those adenosines for which the R 2 of the resulting fit was greater than 0.9. We model the total number of edits to the RNA with a Poisson binomial distribution with n trials where n is the total number of editable positions and success probabilities given by y i ( t ) for each position i . The probability of having n edits at time t is given by p ( n , t ) = ∑ A:sum ( A ) = n ∏ k : A k = 1 y k ( t ) ∏ j : A j = 0 1 − y j ( t ) Here , A is a binary vector with each entry corresponding to a specific adenosine in the timestamp editing region. A k = 1 if adenosine k has been edited to inosine, and sum( A ) counts the total number of edits in A . Time estimates using the exponential model were then made by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between p ( n , t ) and the empirical distribution q ( n ) over t . p ( n , t ) was calculated in practice via a dynamic programming approach.

For Supplementary Fig. 3 , the exponential model was calculated using the data from a single replicate of the HEK doxycycline experiment. The distributions in Supplementary Fig. 3c show the number of edits per RNA calculated across all bases with R 2 greater than 0.9 for that replicate, and the Poisson binomial model in Supplementary Fig. 3c likewise included the same bases. By contrast, for Supplementary Fig. 3d , bases were retained only if they had an R 2 greater than 0.9 in all three replicates from the HEK doxycycline experiment. For this reason, the apparent numbers of edits per RNA are lower in Supplementary Fig. 3d than in Supplementary Fig. 3c .

A schematic depicting the gradient descent algorithm is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 . The gradient descent in Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 9 was implemented using custom code in MATLAB (MATLAB 2017a). Briefly, the gradient descent algorithm was given an RNA editing distribution (a normalized histogram of edits per RNA), which could be either an experimentally measured distribution ( Figs. 2b – d and 3c – g ) or a simulated distribution ( Fig. 3a , b and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 9 ). Simulated distributions were generated using data from the experiment in Fig. 1e , f , either by randomly sampling RNAs from a specified timepoint or timepoints from that experiment (as in Fig. 3a , b and Supplementary Fig. 9 ) or by taking convex combinations of the editing distributions from that experiment (as in Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The gradient descent algorithm was also given a set of ‘basis vector’ histograms, which were obtained by combining the data at each timepoint from all three replicates from the HEK doxycycline experiment. The gradient descent was then initialized by drawing a set of weights from a Dirichlet distribution with all parameters set to unity. The gradient descent minimized the mean squared error (L2 norm) between the input distribution and the convex combination of the basis vectors given by the weights. For each simulated distribution, we performed the gradient descent 1,000 times and took the solution that minimized the L2 norm.

To avoid overfitting, whenever an input to the gradient descent was simulated, the distributions used as ‘basis’ functions in the gradient descent were averages of all three biological replicates from the experiment in Fig. 1e , f , whereas the simulated distributions were always generated from the data associated with a single replicate.

An exception to this policy was made for Supplementary Fig. 6 , where RNAs were randomly chosen from all three replicates, and then the gradient descent was performed using basis functions that were averages of all three replicates. This exception was made to be able to simulate ramp distributions with 10,000 or 30,000 RNAs, which would not have been possible without combining data from all three replicates. For this reason, there is some risk that the accuracy of the decoding in Supplementary Fig. 6 would be lower if different basis vectors were used for the decoding.

An analysis of the performance of the gradient descent algorithm on random simulated transcriptional programs is presented in Supplementary Fig. 9 . In general, the gradient descent algorithm succeeded in reproducing the editing histogram with high accuracy ( Supplementary Fig. 9a ). Additionally, the weight vector found by the gradient descent algorithm was, on average, much closer to the true weight vector than randomly sampled vectors ( Supplementary Fig. 9b ), although this was not always true ( Supplementary Fig. 9c ). Because the simulated and approximated editing histograms were generated with different basis distributions, noise present in those basis distributions meant that the true weight vector was not, in general, the optimal solution for the gradient descent ( Supplementary Fig. 9d , e ).

In Fig. 3b , g , a weight distribution generated by the gradient descent algorithm was defined to have two peaks if the sum of the weights on the 1- and 2-h timepoints and the sum of the weights on the 4- and 5-h timepoints were both greater than the weight on the 3-h timepoint. When making Fig. 3b , g , we generated several possible definitions for what would constitute ‘two peaks’ and obtained qualitatively similar behavior (monotonically increasing identification of two peaks) for all of them. This definition was chosen for presentation arbitrarily.

In Fig. 2c , temporal estimation error is calculated by multiplying the distance of each timepoint away from the expected timepoint by the weight assigned to that timepoint and summing. Thus, for the 3-h single-induction pulse, if the decoder assigned weights of 0.5 to the 3-h timepoint and 0.5 to the 5-h timepoint, the resulting estimation error would be 0.5*0 + 0.5*2 = 1 h. This metric is not directly comparable to the 95% confidence interval presented in reference to Fig. 1f , but if the procedure used to generate Fig. 2c is repeated for ‘sets’ consisting of a single RNA, the error obtained is 1.9 ± 0.47 h (mean ± s.d., n = 12 timepoints), which is significantly greater than the 1.49 ± 0.42 h obtained for sets of four RNAs (means differ by >3 standard errors), supporting the statement that the error for four RNAs is less than that for a single RNA.

For the arbitrary transcriptional program experiments in Supplementary Fig. 9 and the ramp in Supplementary Fig. 6 , we calculated the accuracy as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the assigned and expected weights, divided by 2 to avoid double counting. Thus, if we expected one timepoint to get 100% of the total weight, and that timepoint, instead, got 80% of the total weight, then the resulting accuracy would be 80%.

In Fig. 4b , the accuracy is calculated as the mean absolute difference between the single-cell estimates and the estimate for the bulk distribution. We calculate the accuracy in this way for the single cells because the underlying transcriptional program is not known. The single cells stay on ice for up to 1 h during processing, and we have not measured the editing kinetics during that time.

All procedures involving animals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care. Primary hippocampal neuron culture was prepared as previously described 15 . Briefly, neurons were transfected at 6–7 days in vitro (DIV) using a commercial calcium–phosphate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K278001) with 600 ng of pUC19, 200 ng of plasmid 116v5 and 200 ng of plasmid 187. Neurons were then incubated with calcium–phosphate precipitates for 30–60 min, followed by washing with MEM buffer at pH 6.7–6.8 to remove residual precipitates.

Neurons were stimulated at 14–15 DIV. Neurons were placed in 1 ml of plating medium (500 ml of MEM, 2.5 g of glucose, 50 mg of transferrin, 1.1 g of HEPES, 5 ml of 200 mM L-glutamine, 12.5 mg of insulin, 50 ml of HI FBS and 10 ml of B27 supplement). To stimulate the neurons, we added 250 μl of 5× depolarization medium and agitated gently. Neurons were then left for 1 h in an incubator. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated, and neurons were washed twice in plating medium. They were then left in plating medium for a variable amount of time before being lysed in 600 μl of buffer RLT Plus.

1.1 g of HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, H3375–500G)

5 ml of 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25030–081)

12.5 mg of insulin (Millipore, 407709)

50 ml of HI FBS (VWR, 45000–736)

Owing to the limited availability of neuron culture at any given time, the data for Supplementary Fig. 5 were gathered in two separate experiments with different sample replicates per experiment. We collected the following timepoints: before stimulation (that is, immediately before adding depolarization medium); 1 h after stimulation (that is, immediately before washing the neurons in fresh medium); 2 h after stimulation; 3 h after stimulation; 3.5 h after stimulation; 4 h after stimulation; 5 h after stimulation; 5.5 h after stimulation; 6 h after stimulation; and 7 h after stimulation.

The breakdown of the data in Supplementary Fig. 5 by experiment is as follows. In the first experiment, we collected two samples before stimulation, three samples at 1 h, three samples at 2 h, three samples at 3 h, three samples at 4 h and two samples at 5 h. In the second experiment, we collected one sample at 2 h, two samples at 3 h, three samples at 3.5 h, two samples at 4 h, two samples at 5 h, three samples at 5.5 h, two samples at 6 h and two samples at 7 h.

In Supplementary Fig. 5 , the timepoints associated with the c-fos neural activity were determined by linear interpolation as follows. We first calculated the mean number of edits per RNA for all replicates and determined the mean across replicates for each timepoint (plotted in Supplementary Fig. 5b , designated M t ). Then, to perform the estimate, for each replicate R from timepoint t , we identified the two timepoints, t 1 and t 2 , such that t! = t 1 , t 2 and such that the mean m R of replicate R obeyed M t1 < m R < M t2 . The time estimate for replicate R is then determined as t R = m R − M t 1 M t 2 − M t 1 ( t 2 − t 1 ) + t 1
