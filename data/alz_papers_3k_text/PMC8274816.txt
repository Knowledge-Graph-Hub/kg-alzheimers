Restoring metabolism of myeloid cells reverses cognitive decline in ageing

## PGE2–EP2 signalling drives brain ageing
The lipid messenger PGE 2 is a downstream product of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway ( Extended Data Fig. 1a ) and a major modulator of inflammation 11 . Levels of PGE 2 increase in ageing and in neurodegenerative disease 18 – 20 . We hypothesized that increases in PGE 2 might underlie the development of age-associated maladaptive inflammation and cognitive decline. We identified a significant increase in PGE 2 synthesis in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from individuals of over 65 years of age, compared to those from younger individuals (below 35 years of age) ( Fig. 1a ; Extended Data Fig. 1b ). Given the link between cellular metabolism and myeloid cell function 17 , we tested whether PGE 2 signalling affected macrophage bioenergetics. Dose-dependent stimulation with PGE 2 decreased glycolysis (extra-cellular acidification rate (ECAR)) and suppressed the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in human MDMs ( Fig. 1b , c ). Although PGE 2 signals through four G-protein-coupled receptors—EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 21 —this suppressive effect of PGE 2 was mediated specifically by the EP2 receptor, the expression of which increased markedly in aged human MDMs ( Extended Data Fig. 1c – f ). In contrast to PGE 2 and the EP2 agonist butaprost ( Fig. 1d ), treatment with the EP2 inhibitors PF-04418948 22 and compound 52 (C52) 23 led to an increase in OCR and ECAR in macrophages ( Extended Data Fig. 1g , h ). These data suggest that inhibition of PGE 2 –EP2 signalling might enhance energy production in ageing myeloid cells.

Plasma and brain PGE 2 levels, as well as macrophage EP2 levels, also increased in aged (20-month-old) mice relative to young mice ( Extended Data Fig. 1i – k ). Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of EP2 in ageing Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice, in which levels of myeloid EP2 are reduced by 50% 24 , increased OCR and ECAR in peritoneal macrophages ( Fig. 1e ). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed age-associated abnormalities in the morphology, number and density of mitochondria in peritoneal macrophages from aged Cd11bCre mice; these mitochondrial abnormalities were not present in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice ( Fig. 1f , g ). Aged Cd11bCre macrophages exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to young macrophages; however, the polarization state of aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox macrophages was indistinguishable from that of young macrophages of either genotype ( Fig. 1h , Extended Data Fig. 2a ). Knockdown of myeloid EP2 in aged mice also restored phagocytic capability to a level comparable to that of young mice ( Fig. 1i ). Multiplex profiling of immune factors showed that there was a distinctive pattern of pro-inflammatory factor enrichment in the plasma and hippocampus of aged Cd11bCre mice, whereas aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice had profiles more similar to those of young mice ( Fig. 1j , Extended Data Fig. 2b , c ). Thus, myeloid knockdown of EP2 prevents age-associated changes in cell bioenergetics, polarization state and phagocytic capability.

Given the association between inflammation and cognitive impairment, we reasoned that a reduction in myeloid EP2 signalling and the consequent rejuvenation of myeloid metabolism and function might improve cognitive function in ageing mice. Hippocampal-dependent spatial memory is particularly vulnerable to ageing, so we tested the performance of mice in the object location memory task and the Barnes maze task. In both tasks, the performance of aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice was indistinguishable from that of young mice of either genotype—in sharp contrast to aged Cd11bCre control mice ( Fig. 2a – d , Extended Data Figs. 2d , e , 9a ). Hippocampal pre- and postsynaptic proteins, the levels of which decrease in ageing 25 , 26 , were increased in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox hippocampi ( Extended Data Fig. 2f ).We assessed hippocampal synaptic plasticity in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice using electrophysiological recordings of the CA3 to CA1 Schaffer collateral pathway, and found that these mice showed a robust improvement in long-term potentiation—a cellular correlate of learning and memory that deteriorates with ageing 27 ( Fig. 2e , Extended Data Fig. 2g ). Thus, reduction of myeloid EP2 signalling in ageing mice restores hippocampal plasticity and memory function to youthful levels.

## PGE2–EP2 signalling suppresses glucose flux
To understand how inhibition of EP2 signalling elicited these beneficial effects in the context of ageing, we examined signalling cascades downstream of EP2 ( Extended Data Fig. 2h ). PGE 2 –EP2 signalling led to the activation of protein kinase B (also known as AKT), which then phosphorylated and inactivated GSK3β at Ser9 28 , 29 , leading to the activation of glycogen synthase (GYS1) and glycogen synthesis. Reduction of EP2 signalling in Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox macrophages led to GSK3β-mediated inactivation of GYS1 and decreased levels of intracellular glycogen ( Fig. 2f , g , Extended Data Fig. 2i ). Pharmacological inhibition of EP2 yielded similar results in mouse peritoneal macrophages and human MDMs ( Extended Data Fig. 3a – c , Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Untargeted metabolomics in human MDMs treated with EP2 inhibitor revealed increased levels of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate in these cells compared to vehicle-treated human MDMs ( Extended Data Fig. 3d , e ), suggesting that EP2 signalling has an effect on glucose flux down the glycolytic pathway.

To further explore the metabolic effects of EP2 signalling in macrophages, we administered [U- 13 C]glucose to aged Cd11bCre and Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice, isolated macrophages four hours later and measured labelled metabolites from the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways ( Fig. 2h , i , Extended Data Fig. 3f ). Knockdown of EP2 in macrophages reduced the in vivo incorporation of 13 C-glucose into uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose), the precursor of glycogen, and increased the incorporation of 13 C-glucose into glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates—consistent with increased glucose flux. We also performed 13 C-glucose labelling in human MDMs treated with the EP2 inhibitor C52, and obtained similar results ( Extended Data Fig. 3g , h ). Previous studies have shown that cellular bioenergetics regulate the polarization state of macrophages through the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates such as pro-inflammatory succinate 12 , 16 , 30 – 33 . Consistent with this, inhibition of EP2 shifted the polarization of human MDMs to a more anti-inflammatory activation state with increased phagocytic capacity ( Extended Data Fig. 3i , j ). These genetic and pharmacological findings link EP2-driven changes in glycogen synthesis and glucose flux to the activation state and phagocytic ability of macrophages.

We next directly tested the effect of reducing glycogen synthesis on the energy metabolism, cytokine production and polarization state of macrophages. Knockdown of rate-limiting GYS1 in human MDMs decreased glycogen levels and increased basal respiration and ECAR ( Extended Fig. 4a – c ). Consistent with this, GYS1-depleted human MDMs showed improved bioenergetics compared to control cells, with increases in glycolytic intermediates, NAD + , NADH and NADPH, and reduced glutathione levels (targeted metabolomics analysis) ( Extended Data Fig. 4d ). A shift away from glycogen synthesis and towards glycolysis was further confirmed using 13 C-glucose isotope tracing in human MDMs, which was associated with a more anti-inflammatory activation state ( Extended Data Fig. 4e , f ). We then tested whether GYS1 deficiency in aged macrophages could restore youthful mitochondrial function and polarization state. Indeed, knockdown of GYS1 in human MDMs from aged individuals (over 65 years of age) restored glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration and polarization state to levels observed in human MDMs from young individuals (below 35 years of age) ( Fig. 3a – c , Extended Data Fig. 4g , h ). Notably, activation of EP2 signalling with butaprost did not alter the bioenergetic or immune phenotypes of aged human MDMs that lack GYS1 ( Fig. 3d , e , Extended Data Fig. 4i ), confirming that GYS1 is a critical effector of EP2-mediated effects on myeloid metabolism and immune state.

We then tested the effect of pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory EP2 in aged human MDMs. PGE 2 levels and GYS1 activation increased in human MDMs derived from aged compared to young individuals ( Extended Data Fig. 5a – c ). Consistent with our genetic data in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice, pharmacological inhibition of EP2 in aged human MDMs normalized glycogen levels and restored glycolysis and mitochondrial OCR to levels similar to those observed in young human MDMs ( Fig. 3f , g , Extended Data Fig. 5d ). EP2 blockade in aged human MDMs restored mitochondrial protein levels, membrane potential and reactive oxygen species to youthful levels 34 ( Fig. 3h , Extended Data Fig. 5e – g ). Targeted metabolomics and 13 C-glucose tracing confirmed the rescue of glucose flux in aged human MDMs treated with EP2 inhibitor, and phagocytosis also improved in these human MDMs ( Fig. 3i , j , Extended Data Fig. 5h , i ). Inhibition of inflammatory COX-2 also improved mitochondrial respiration in aged human MDMs ( Extended Data Fig. 5j , k ).

The activity of respiratory complex II of the electron transport chain (succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)) is suppressed in aged macrophages 17 . Low SDH activity leads to the accumulation of succinate—a TCA cycle metabolite that stabilizes the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which is an activator of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression 16 , 31 – 33 . Accumulation of succinate is also observed in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS); in this context, itaconate, an endogenous inhibitor of SDH, is generated from the TCA cycle intermediate cis -aconitate by cis -aconitate decarboxylase, which is highly induced in settings of inflammation 31 . Here, LPS-mediated changes in OCR and ECAR or succinate accumulation did not change with EP2 blockade, and nor did the levels of aconitate and itaconate ( Extended Data Fig. 6a – c ). These data indicate that the metabolic state of aged macrophages is distinct from that of LPS-activated macrophages ( Extended Data Fig. 6d ).

Glycogen is a fuel source that is used by many cell types, including immune cells 35 , 36 . In ageing macrophages, an increase in the activity of PGE 2 , EP2 and GYS1 enhanced the sequestration of glucose into glycogen, leading to lower glucose flux and bioenergetic insufficiency. As cells can normally use alternative fuel sources that bypass GYS1—for example, glutamine or lactate—we wondered whether aged macrophages were unable to metabolize other fuel substrates, thus rendering them more metabolically vulnerable than young macrophages ( Extended Data Fig. 6e – i ). Indeed, labelling of human MDMs with 13 C-isotopes of glutamine, pyruvate, lactate and glucose revealed a fundamental dependence of aged human MDMs on glucose as a fuel source. Whereas young macrophages stably incorporated 13 C derived from glucose, pyruvate, lactate and glutamine into glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, aged macrophages metabolized only glucose. Furthermore, assessment of fuel flexibility confirmed the dependence of aged macrophages on glucose when pyruvate transport was inhibited, indicating that glucose availability and flux are essential for oxidative phosphorylation in aged macrophages ( Extended Data Fig. 6j , k ).

## EP2 blockade reverses cognitive ageing
We then tested whether in vivo pharmacological inhibition of EP2 signalling in aged mice might elicit similar effects on inflammation and cognitive function to those that were observed in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice. EP2 expression localized specifically to IBA1-positive microglia in the hippocampal CA1 area and the parietal cerebral cortex ( Extended Data Fig. 7a – d ). Administration of the brain-penetrant EP2 inhibitor C52 for one month restored pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in plasma and hippocampus to youthful levels and reduced the levels of CD68, a lysosomal protein associated with microglial activation ( Fig. 4a – c , Extended Data Fig. 7e – h ). Brain microglia and peritoneal macrophages assayed for in vivo incorporation of 13 C-glucose showed reduced glycogen synthesis and enhanced glycolytic and TCA cycle labelling after in vivo EP2 inhibition ( Fig. 4d , Extended Data Fig. 8a , Supplementary Fig. 3 ). TEM of hippocampi from aged mice treated with C52 showed a resolution of mitochondrial morphology to a more youthful state ( Extended Data Fig. 8f – h ). Functionally, EP2 blockade reversed age-associated spatial memory deficits in the novel object location and Barnes maze tasks and restored synaptic proteins to similar levels to those of young mice ( Fig. 4e , f , Extended Data Figs. 7i , j , 8b , 9b ). Electrophysiological recordings in aged mice also showed that treatment with C52 restored hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation to youthful levels ( Fig. 4g , Extended Data Fig. 8c ). Together, these results with C52 recapitulate our findings in aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice.

Healthy mitochondria are critical for synaptic neurotransmission and plasticity. We assessed the integrity of synaptic mitochondria by determining the extent of coupling between the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP in synaptosomes 37 ( Fig. 4h , Extended Data Fig. 8d , e ). The respiratory control ratio, represented as the ratio of state III/state IVo, was significantly increased after inhibition of EP2, indicating improved mitochondrial coupling of electron transport and ATP synthesis. These data demonstrate that inhibition of inflammatory EP2 improves the mitochondrial health of aged synapses.

As the EP2 receptor is highly expressed in aged peripheral myeloid cells as well as in aged brain microglia ( Extended Data Figs. 1c , k , 9d , e , l ), we examined whether peripheral EP2 blockade could reverse age-associated inflammation and hippocampal memory deficits. Administration of the brain-impermeant EP2 antagonist PF-04418948 22 for six weeks reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors not only in the blood but also in the hippocampus, and—notably—restored hippocampal memory function as well as long-term potentiation to youthful levels ( Fig. 4i – l , Extended Data Figs. 1g , 9c , f – m ). Transcriptomic analysis of peritoneal macrophages revealed a marked restoration of youth-associated immune and metabolic signatures in aged mice that were treated with PF-04418948 ( Fig. 4m , Extended Data Fig. 10 ).

## Discussion
Our study suggests that the development of maladaptive inflammation and cognitive decline in ageing may not be a static or permanent condition, but rather that it can be reversed by inhibiting inflammatory PGE 2 signalling through the myeloid EP2 receptor. First, we find that ageing is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory PGE 2 signalling in myeloid cells, which drives the sequestration of glucose into glycogen through the AKT–GSK3β–GYS1 pathway and away from the generation of ATP. Second, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability of ageing myeloid cells, in which they become dependent on glucose and are unable to use alternative energy sources to support mitochondrial respiration. These two mechanisms converge, leading to a reduction of glucose flux and the development of an energy-depleted state that drives pro-inflammatory immune responses. Third, by directing glucose towards the production of ATP, as opposed to glycogen storage, inhibition of myeloid EP2 in ageing cells reverts the polarization state to a more homeostatic anti-inflammatory state that prevents age-associated cognitive decline. We also demonstrate that peripheral EP2 blockade is sufficient to re-establish youthful immune homeostasis not only in the blood, but also in the brain, and to restore hippocampal function and plasticity in aged mice. The mechanisms underlying this rescue are probably distinct from those that underlie the effect of a brain-penetrant EP2 inhibitor that can directly target microglial EP2 signalling. Peripheral EP2 blockade may lead to changes in the composition of blood, components of which could beneficially affect the ageing cerebrovascular endothelium or penetrate the brain parenchyma to improve neuronal function.

Finally, our findings are consistent with a feedforward loop involving the inflammatory COX-2–PGE 2 –EP2 cascade, in which increasing PGE 2 signalling via the EP2 receptor induces additional COX-2 expression and activity, further amplifying downstream PGE 2 generation and signalling 24 , 38 , 39 . Thus, inhibition of EP2-dependent changes in myeloid metabolism may represent a new approach to disorders of ageing, with greater specificity than the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that target COX-2 and COX-1 and suppress both beneficial and toxic prostaglandin signalling pathways 40 .

## Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stanford University approved protocols. All mice were housed in an environmentally controlled, pathogen-free barrier facility on a 12-h light–dark cycle, with food and water available ad libitum. The Stanford Veterinary Service Center monitors and maintains pathogen-free mouse housing. C57BL/6J mice were bred in our laboratory using mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory or obtained from the NIH aged rodent colony. For genetic and pharmacological experiments, both control and experimental genotypes were housed together in the same cages. Young (2–4-month-old) and aged (20–24-month-old) C57BL/6J mice used in each experiment were age- and source-matched. Cd11bCre and Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice have been previously described 24 . For confirmation of EP2 expression in microglia, C57BL/6J ROSA-CreER T2 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were crossed to C57BL/6J EP2 lox/lox mice 24 or wild-type mice for generation of ROSA-CreER T2 ;EP2 lox/lox and ROSA-CreER T2 ;EP2 +/+ mice. Tamoxifen (2 mg intraperitoneally for 5 days; Sigma) was administered to mice of all Rosa-CreER T2 genotypes at 8 weeks of age following established protocols 41 .

PGE 2 , Butaprost, PF-04418948 and Iloprost were purchased from Millipore-Sigma. ONO-AE248 and ONO-AE1–329 were gifts from Ono Pharmaceuticals. C52 (Charnwood Molecular) and PF-04418948 (Millipore-Sigma) were resuspended in 40% PEG (Sigma-Aldrich) and 60% of a 30% Kolliphor HS15 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and administered orally at 10 mg/kg/d and 2.5 mg/kg/d, respectively. U- 13 C-glucose, U- 13 C-lactate, U- 13 C-glutamine and U- 13 C-pyruvate were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes. HUSH-29 plasmids containing shRNAs to human GYS1 were purchased from Origene Technologies. Human MDMs were incubated with 1640 medium with GlutaMAX + HEPES without sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 72400146). Mouse macrophages were incubated in DMEM without sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, D5796).

Cells were counted and plated at 1.8 × 10 5 (mouse peritoneal macrophages) or 1.0 × 10 5 (human MDMs) cells per well in a Seahorse XF24 Cell Culture Microplate for all experiments (Agilent). Cells were then treated with indicated inhibitors or agonists in each experiment for 20 h. Cells were washed twice with Agilent Seahorse XF medium (Agilent) supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM l -glutamine and 10 mM d-glucose; a final volume of 525 μl was placed in each well. Cells were then incubated in a 0% CO 2 chamber at 37 °C for 1 h before being placed into a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent). For OCR and ECAR mitostress test experiments, cells were treated with 1 μM oligomycin, 2 μM FCCP and 0.5 μM rotenone or antimycin (indicated by three black arrows in representative OCR traces). For mitoFlex Fuel test experiments, cells were treated with UK5099 (200 μM) and BPTES (200 μM) or Etomoxir (80 μM). A total of three OCR and pH measurements were taken after each compound was administered. All Seahorse experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated. All OCR and ECAR data were normalized to cell number per well using CyQUANT (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Primary peritoneal mouse macrophages from young (3–4-month-old) and aged (20–23-month-old) Cd11bCre;Ep2 lox/lox and C11bCre mice were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 10 6 cells per well; 2 × 10 6 cells ml −1 were isolated for electron microscopy processing. Hippocampi were isolated from young (3–4-months) and aged (22–24 months) mice treated with C52 (10 mg/kg/d, 1 month). Cells and hippocampi were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), treated with 10% gelatin solution in sodium cacodylate buffer and incubated with 2% osmium tetroxide. Cell pellets were stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in resin (EPON epoxy resin). Sections were generated using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) at 50 nm and placed within grids stained with a 1:1 mix of 3% uranyl acetate, 50% acetone for 30–60 s. Grids were imaged with a JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at × 1,200 for low magnification and × 12,000 for high magnification (unless otherwise noted) using Gatan Microscopy Suite software (Gatan). Images were quantified by an individual blinded to experimental conditions in ImageJ. Abnormal mitochondria were defined as containing at least one of the following features: paracrystalline inclusions, linearization of cristae and abnormal angular features, concentric layering of cristae membranes, matrix compartmentalization or nanotunnelling, in combination with doughnut-shaped mitochondria. Microglia from hippocampal sections were identified in TEM by presence of the following characteristics: relative size (3–10 μm), degenerating myelin vacuoles, lipid inclusions, prominent heterochromatin nets throughout the nucleus and electron-dense cytoplasm.

Human MDMs were plated in 10-cm plates at 10 × 10 6 cells per well and collected using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C. Cells were washed with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and then incubated with blocking buffer (5% mouse serum in flow cytometry buffer) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then stained with the desired antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Dead cells were identified and excluded using 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. The following controls were used: unstained cells; single-stained cells; and dead cells. The cells were gated using forward and side scatter, as well as live–dead staining using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were analysed on a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). Raw FCS files were analysed with FlowJo software (FlowJo). Antibodies to the following markers were obtained from BD Biosciences (listed as: catalogue number, channel, dilution, clone): Human CD14 (557831, APC-Cy7, 1:50, MφP9); human CD64 (560970, FITC, 1:50, 10.1); human CD206 (566281, FITC, 1:50, 19.2); human CD68 (565595, PE-Cy7, 1:200, Y1/82A); human CD163 (556018, PE, 1:50, GHI/61); human CD86 (555660, APC, 1:50, FUN-1); mouse CD80 (564160, BV421, 1:50, 16-10A1); mouse CD14 (553740, PE-Cy7, 1:50, rmC5-3); mouse CD71 (561936, FITC, 1:50, C2F2); and mouse CD86 (563055, BV605, 1:50, GL1). Anti-EGR2 was obtained from Invitrogen (1706691-82, APC, 1:50, ERONGR2).

Hippocampal lysates or mouse plasma were stored at −80 °C and cytokine analysis was carried out at the Human Immune Monitoring Core (Stanford University) or Eve Technologies (Calgary) using Luminex mouse 39-plex kits and human 71-plex kits. Plates were read using a Luminex LabMap200 instrument or a MSD chemiluminescence instrument with a lower bound of 100 beads per sample per measured cytokine. Each sample was tested in triplicate. MFI was averaged over duplicate wells for each cytokine per sample on each plate. All were perfused with PBS before isolation of hippocampi and other brain tissue.

The novel object location (object location memory task) protocol was adopted from a previous study 42 with minor modifications. Mice interacted with the chamber (a 16 × 16 × 15-inch white box made from PVC) over the course of 2 days involving 1 habituation period, 3 training sessions and 1 testing session. On the day of training (day 1) mice were placed in the middle of an empty chamber and given 5 min to explore the chamber. Mice were then placed in an independent holding cage for an inter-training interval (ITI) of 3 min. The objects used were a plastic bottle and seasoning shaker of similar size (3 inch H × 1 inch W × 1 inch L). After the habituation session, the mice then underwent three 10-min training sessions each with a 3-min ITI in between sessions. Twenty-four hours after the last training session, a testing session was conducted in which one of the objects was displaced to a new location. Mice were recorded using a JVC Everio HD camcorder GZE200 and analysed with Kinovea video tracking software. Exploration of the objects was defined as the amount of time mice were oriented towards an object with their nose within 1 cm of it, and was scored by an experimenter blind to experimental group.

The Barnes maze protocol was adopted from a previous study 43 with minor modifications. The maze was made from a circular, 8-mm thick, white PVC slab with a diameter of 36 inches. Twenty holes with a diameter of 3 inches were made on the perimeter at a distance of 1 inch from the edge. This circular platform was then mounted on top of a rotating stool, 30 inches above the ground.

The escape cage was made by using a mouse cage and assembling a platform and ramp 2 inches below the surface of the maze. The outside of the walls of the cage were covered with black tape so as to prevent light for entering the escape cage. The maze placed in the centre of a dedicated room and two 120-W lights were placed on the edges of the room facing towards the maze to provide an aversive stimulus for the mice. Eight simple coloured-paper shapes (squares, rectangles and circles) were mounted on the walls of the room as visual cues.

After testing each mouse, the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol and rotated clockwise after every mouse to avoid intra-maze odour or visual cues. All sessions were recorded using a JVC Everio HD camcorder GZ-E200 and analysed with Kinovea video tracking software.

The mice interacted with the Barnes maze in three phases: habituation (day 1), training (days 2–3) and probe (day 4). Before starting each experiment, mice were acclimated to the testing room for 1 h. Then all mice from one cage ( n = 4 or 5) were placed in individual holding cages, where they remained until the end of their testing sessions each day. On habituation day, the mice were placed in the centre of the maze within a vertically oriented black PVC pipe 4 inches in diameter and 7 inches in height for 15 s. The mice were then guided slowly to the hole that led to the escape cage over the course of 10–15 s. The mice were given 3 min to independently enter the target hole, and if they did not, they were nudged with the PVC pipe to enter. The 120-W lights were then shut off and mice were allowed to rest in the escape cage for 2 min.

The training phase occurred 24 h after the habituation phase and was split across 2 days (days 2 and 3), with 3 trials on the first day and 2 trials on the second day. During each trial, the mice were placed in the centre of the maze within the PVC pipe for 15 s and afterwards were allowed 3 min to explore the maze. If mice found and entered the target hole before 3 min passed, the lights were shut off and the training trial ended. Mice were allowed to rest in the escape cage for 2 min. If at the end of the three minutes the mice had not entered the target hole, they were nudged with the PVC pipe. A total of five trials were conducted. During each trial, latency (time) to enter the target hole as well as distance travelled were recorded.

The probe phase occurred 24 h after the training phase and was conducted on the last day (day 4). Mice were placed in the centre of the maze within the PVC pipe for 15 s and afterwards were allowed 3 min to explore the maze. The probe session ended whenever the mouse entered the target hole or if 3 min had passed. During the probe phase, measures of time spent per quadrant, latency to enter the target hole and distance travelled were recorded.

To measure the cellular mechanism of learning and memory, we used a modified protocol previously described 44 . In brief, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the hippocampus was rapidly dissected out into ice-cold (4 °C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), saturated with carbogen (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ). ACSF consisted of (in mM): 124 NaCl, 4.9 KCl, 24.6 NaHCO 3 , 1.20 KH 2 PO 4 , 2.0 CaCl 2 , 2.0 MgSO 4 and 10.0 glucose, pH 7.4. Transverse hippocampal slices (350 μm thick) were prepared from the dorsal area of the hippocampus with the McIlwain tissue chopper and transferred to a recovery chamber for at least 1.5 h with oxygenated ACSF at room temperature before being placed into a submerged-type chamber in which they were kept at 32 °C and continuously perfused with ACSF at a flow-rate of 1.5 ml/min. Slices were carefully positioned on a R6501A multi-electrode array (Alpha MED Scientific) with electrodes arrayed in an 8 × 2 matrix with interpolar distance of 150 μm; each matrix measured 50 μm × 50 μm. After a 30-min incubation, the fEPSPs in CA1 were recorded by stimulating downstream electrodes in the CA1 and CA3 regions along the Schaffer collateral pathway. Signals were acquired using the MED64 System (AlphaMED Sciences, Panasonic). The time course of the fEPSP was calculated as the descending slope function for all experiments. Input/output curves were established by applying increasing stimulus currents to the pathway from 10 μA to 90 μA (in 5-μA increments) and recording evoked responses. After input/output curves had been established, the stimulation strength was adjusted to elicit a fEPSP slope at 35% maximal value, which was maintained throughout the experiment. During baseline recording, a single response was evoked at a 30-s interval for at least 20 min. To induce a strong form of long-term potentiation, three episodes of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were used, each TBS consisting of 10 bursts of 4 stimuli at 100 Hz separated by 200 ms (double pulse-width), followed by recording evoked responses beginning 1 min after the induction of long-term potentiation and continuing every 30 s until the end of the experiments. Experiments using control and transgenic mice were interleaved with each other. The mean baseline fEPSP value was calculated and percentage change from baseline after the TBS was analysed for long-term potentiation.

Quantitative immunoblotting was carried out as previously described 38 . Mouse anti-β-actin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-β-tubulin was used as an internal loading control. Imaging of blots was carried out using a Licor CLX-1306 with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Analysis was carried out in Image Studio Lite and signal intensities were normalized to loading controls, when applicable.

Peritoneal macrophages were collected from 2–4-, 6- and 20–24-month-old Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox , Cd11bCre and wild-type mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 ml 3% (w/v) thioglycolate medium (BD Biosciences), and primary macrophages were isolated 3–4 days later by flushing with ice-cold 1× PBS buffer (Corning). Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 10 6 cells per well in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 U ml −1 penicillin and streptomycin, and maintained at 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. After overnight culture, cells were washed twice with medium to remove non-adherent cells.

Hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 17.5 mouse embryos, dissociated using trypsin (2 mg/ml) and DNase I (0.6 mg/ml), and plated at a density of 100,000 cells per well in Seahorse XF24 culture plate coated with poly-l-lysine. Neurons were maintained in neurobasal medium, B27 (Invitrogen) and penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The medium was refreshed twice weekly by replacing half the medium with fresh medium. After 12–14 days in vitro, cells underwent real-time oxygen consumption analysis with the Seahorse XFe24 machine and the MitoStress test kit.

Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1–2 C57BL/6J mice. In brief, dissociated cortical cells were suspended in DMEM/F12 50/50 (Life Technologies, 11320-033) containing 25 mM glucose, 4 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% FBS, and plated on uncoated 75-cm 2 flasks at a density of 1.5 × 10 5 cells per cm 2 . Monolayers of astrocytes were obtained 12–14 days after plating. Cultures were gently shaken, and floating cells (microglia) were collected, resulting in a more than 95% pure culture of astrocytes. Astrocytes were dissociated by trypsinization and then reseeded at 4 × 10 4 cells per well in a XF24-well cell culture microplate, and cells underwent real-time oxygen consumption analysis with the Seahorse XFe24 machine and the MitoStress test kit.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from de-identified healthy donors (young, below 35 years old; aged, above 65 years old) were obtained from the Stanford Blood Center and transferred to 50-ml conical tubes. Samples were diluted with 20 ml PBS and layered onto 10 ml of Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) using a Pasteur pipette. Tubes were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 25 min without brake at 20 °C. The mononuclear cell layer was transferred to a new 50-ml conical tube, resuspended in 50 ml 1× PBS and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min, repeated twice. After centrifugation, monocytes were isolated using a Monocyte Isolation Kit, human (130-096-537, Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were then plated 10 × 10 6 per 10-cm Petri dish and differentiated for 7 days in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 50 ng ml −1 M-CSF (Peprotech).

Young and aged mice were administered C52 for 10 days at 10 mg/kg/day by oral gavage. On day 10, U- 13 C-glucose (1g/kg by gavage) was administered for in vivo isotope tracing of brain microglia and peritoneal macrophages were collected 4 h later. Microglia were isolated by flow cytometry (see ‘ Microglial isolation ’) and peritoneal macrophages were isolated by lavage and processed by LC–MS for measurement of metabolites (see ‘ LC–MS measurement of metabolites for in vitro and in vivo studies ’).

Isotope labelling was performed as previously described 45 . Labelled compounds U- 13 C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were added to customized RPMI medium lacking glucose (customized RPMI 1640 medium + Gibco GlutaMAX supplement + HEPES; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or prepared in 0.9% saline for oral gavage.

Water soluble metabolites: Human MDMs were grown on 10-cm plates (Corning). For steady-state labelling of metabolites, U- 13 C-glucose (11.1 mM)-labelled medium was replaced every day and then 20 h before metabolic analysis, at which point cellular metabolism was quenched by rapidly cooling cells on dry ice. Cells were washed with 1× PBS twice by aspirating the medium and immediately adding 1 ml −80 °C 80:20 methanol/water. After 20 min of incubation on dry ice, the resulting mixture was scraped, collected into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were then extracted again with 500 μl −80 °C 80:20 methanol/water, incubated for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Both extractions were combined into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The supernatants were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min to remove any residual debris before analysis. Supernatants were analysed within 24 h by LC–MS. The LC–MS method involved hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled to the Q Exactive PLUS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The LC separation was performed on a XBridge BEH Amide column (150 mm 3 2.1 mm, 2.5 mm particle size, Waters). Solvent A is 95%: 5% H 2 O: acetonitrile with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and solvent B is acetonitrile. The gradient was 0 min, 85% B; 2 min, 85% B; 3 min, 80% B; 5 min, 80% B; 6 min, 75% B; 7 min, 75% B; 8 min, 70% B; 9 min, 70% B; 10 min, 50% B; 12 min, 50% B; 13 min, 25% B; 16 min, 25% B; 18 min, 0% B; 23 min, 0% B; 24 min, 85% B; 30 min, 85% B. Other LC parameters were: flow rate 150 ml/min, column temperature 25 °C, injection volume 10 ml and autosampler temperature 5 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in both negative- and positive-ion mode for the detection of metabolites. Other MS parameters were: resolution of 140,000 at m / z 200, automatic gain control (AGC) target at 3 ×10 6 , maximum injection time of 30 ms and scan range of m / z 75–1,000. Data were analysed using MAVEN software, and isotope labelling was corrected for natural 13 C abundance in the tracer experiments.

For identification and isolation of hexose phosphates and glycolytic intermediates, capillary electrophoresis mass spectroscopy was used as previously described 46 . In brief, adherent cells on dishes were washed with 5% mannitol aqueous solution at room temperature. The cells were immersed in 400 μl methanol for 30 s, and 275 μl of the Internal Standard Solution (10 μM, Solution ID: H3304-1002, Human Metabolome Technologies) for 30 s. The extraction liquid was centrifuged at 2,300 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (400 μl) was centrifugally filtered at 9,100 g for 4 h at 4 °C through a 5-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore) to remove proteins, and then the filtrate was lyophilized and suspended in 25 μl Milli-Q water. The metabolite suspension was analysed by capillary electrophoresis time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) using an Agilent capillary electrophoresis (CE) system equipped with an Agilent 6210 TOFMS, an 1100 isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography pump, a G1603A CE-MS adaptor kit and a G1607A CE-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) sprayer kit (Agilent Technologies). The system was controlled using G2201AA ChemStation software v.B.03.01 for CE (Agilent).

Human GYS1 shRNA sequences are as follows: shRNA 1: 5′-UCAACAG CAGUGCCGACCGACCGACCGUGAAGGUG-3′; shRNA 2: 5′-GAUCGAAA GACAGCCUGGUCA-3′. Plasmids containing human GYS1 shRNA or scramble (2 μg) (HuSH shRNA shGYS1 Lenti Cloning Vector (pGFP-C-shLenti)) were incubated with a mixture of nucleofection solution and P4 primary cell supplement (82 μl:18 μl nucleofection solution: supplement) and placed in nucleofection cuvettes. A total of 1 × 10 6 human MDMs were added to each cuvette and subjected to program DP-148 for the Nucleofector 4D X-unit device (Lonza). Immediately afterwards, 500 μl of DMEM (preincubated at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 and supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) was added. Cells were then plated in 10-cm plates and incubated 37 °C under 5% CO 2 for 8 h before GYS1 protein expression was analysed by quantitative immunoblotting.

Human MDMs were grown in 10-cm plates at 10 × 10 6 cells per well and then trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C. Cells were then plated in 96-well plates at 80,000 cells per well and the Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with E. coli particles was carried out following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Brain tissue was homogenized with 500 μl of MeOH:formic acid (100:0.2) containing internal standard consisting of a mixture of deuterium-labelled prostaglandins, using microtip sonication. The samples were submitted to solid phase extraction using an Oasis HLB cartridge (5 mg; Waters) as previously described 47 , 48 . In brief, samples were diluted with water:formic acid (100:0.03) to give a final MeOH concentration of 20% by volume, applied to preconditioned cartridges and washed serially with water:formic acid (100:0.03), water:ethanol:formic acid (90:10:0.03), and petroleum ether. Samples were then eluted with 200 μl of MeOH:formic acid (100:0.2). The filtrate was concentrated with a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The concentrated filtrate was dissolved in 20 μl methanol and used for LC–MS/MS. The amount of prostaglandins in brain tissue was quantified using a previously described method 48 . In brief, a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source (LCMS-8060; Shimadzu Corporation) was used in the positive and negative-ESI and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes.

Cell lysates and medium were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions for PGE 2 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (KGE004B, Research & Diagnostic Systems).

Quantification of microglia in free-floating 40-μm coronal sections of young and aged mice was carried out using anti-IBA1 (1:500; NB100-1028; Novus Biologicals), anti-CD68 (1:1,000; MCA1957GA; BioRad), anti-NeuN (1:1,000, MAB377, Millipore-Sigma) and anti-EP2 (1:200, ab167171, Abcam). For quantification of IBA1 and CD68, every eighth section through the brain was stained and imaged. Images were captured using a Keyence BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (Keyence) using the Z -stack function in the BZ-X analyser software (Keyence).

Mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS containing EDTA. Brains were minced with a razor blade and a single-cell suspension obtained by Dounce homogenization in a solution of HBSS containing HEPES, glucose and DNase I. The suspension was filtered through a 70-μm strainer. Myelin was removed using myelin removal beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were stained with CD45–FITC (BioLegend 30-F11) and CD11b–PE Dazzle 594 (BioLegend M1/70) for microglia identification through flow cytometry for mass-labelling experiments. Live cells were identified by 7-AAD exclusion. For quantitative western blot experiments, microglia were isolated from whole brains using a tissue dissociation and Dounce homogenization protocol coupled with myelin removal following a previously established protocol 49 .

Synaptic mitochondria were isolated as previously described 37 . In brief, brain cortices were removed and added to cold freshly prepared 9 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 2 mM K 2 PO 4 , 0.1% BSA, 5 mM HEPES and 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.2). The tissues were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4 °C and layered on top of 3 × 2-ml discontinuous gradient of 15%, 23% and 40% Percoll (GE) and centrifuged at 34,000 g for 14 min. After centrifugation, the band between 15% and 23% containing synaptosomes and the band between 23% and 40% containing nonsynaptic mitochondria were removed and subjected to wash in isolation buffer with 0.02% digitonin. The isolates were then pelleted by centrifugation at 16,500 g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in IB and layered over another discontinuous gradient similar to described above. The band between 23% and 40% containing synaptic mitochondria was obtained and washed in ice-cold IB. Protein estimation was performed using a BioRad Bradford assay (BioRad Laboratories). Isolated mitochondria were immediately used for analysis. Ten micrograms of freshly isolated synaptic mitochondria were plated in XFe24 cell culture microplates in a volume of 50 μl mitochondrial assay solution (MAS: 70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA and 0.2% BSA with 10 mM succinate and 2 μM rotenone) and attached to the wells by spinning down the plates at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. After attaching mitochondria to the plate wells, the volume of wells was made up to 450 μl of MAS containing substrate. In the meantime, Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer was equilibrated to 37 °C overnight a day before the assay. The final concentrations of substrates and inhibitors added to the wells were 4 mM ADP, 2.5μg/ml oligomycin A, 4 μM FCCP and 4 μM antimycin A. The coupling assays were run in 2–3 replicate wells for each independent biological sample. XFe24 data were collected according to Seahorse software. The point-to-point run for each well was exported and statistical analysis was conducted in Prism (GraphPad software) using two-tailed unpaired t -tests.

The concentration of PF-04418948 was measured in aged (20–22 months) mice treated with PF-04418948 2.5 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks in plasma and perfused brain using LC–MS (Shimadzu LC-20AD and ABSciex 4000 QTRAP) at Quintara Discovery. In brief, brain samples were first homogenized in two volumes of ice-cold water, then further twofold diluted in blank plasma. An aliquot of 20 μl of each plasma sample or plasma-diluted tissue homogenate was treated with 100 μl acetonitrile containing internal standard (Terfenadine). The mixture was vortexed on a shaker for 15 min and subsequently centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min. An aliquot of 70 μl of the extract was transferred to an injection plate and reconstituted in 70 μl of water for LC–MS/MS injection. Calibration standards and quality control samples were prepared by spiking the testing compound into blank plasma followed by processing with the samples.

For gene expression analysis on the NanoString nCounter system, 100 ng of RNA was hybridized to a multiplexed nucleotide probe pool for 16 h at 65 °C. Enriched targets were purified and quantified using the nCounter MAX Analysis System. NanoString data analysis was performed by Canopy Biosciences. Raw counts were normalized using the geometric mean of both positive control probes (technical variability) and housekeeping gene probes (assay input variability). Normalized data were uploaded to the interactive analysis platform Rosalind ( https://rosalind.onramp.bio/ ), with a HyperScale architecture developed by OnRamp BioInformatics. Read distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heat maps and sample multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were generated as part of the quality controlstep. The limma R library 1 was used to calculate fold changes and P values and perform optional covariate correction. Clustering of genes for the final heat map of differentially expressed genes was done using the PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) method using the fpc R library 2 that takes into consideration the direction and type of all signals on a pathway, the position, role and type of every gene, and so on. Functional enrichment analysis of pathways, gene ontology, domain structure and other ontologies was performed using HOMER3. Several database sources were referenced for enrichment analysis, including InterPro v.4, NCBI v.5, MSigDB v.6 and 7, REACTOME v.8 and WikiPathways v.9. Enrichment was calculated relative to a set of background genes of relevance to the experiment.

Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical comparisons were made in the Prism software using a Student’s t -test (for two groups meeting the normal distribution criteria, according to the Shapiro–Wilk normality test), Mann–Whitney U -test (for two groups not meeting the normal distribution criteria) or ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (for groups across variables, with multiple comparisons between groups). Data were subjected to Grubbs’ test to identify the presence or absence of outlier data points; no outliers were excluded in our analyses. For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered significant, except for targeted metabolomics in which Q < 0.05. All experiments were repeated in at least duplicate, unless otherwise indicated. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized.

## Extended Data
Data are mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise specified. a , The PGE 2 synthetic pathway. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin precursor PGH 2 by the action of constitutive COX-1 and/or inducible COX-2; this step is inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). PGE 2 synthase converts PGH 2 to PGE 2 which can bind to four distinct G-protein-coupled receptors (EP1–EP4 receptors). b , Top, representative immunoblot of two independent experiments quantifying COX-2 and PGE 2 synthase in young and aged human MDMs. Bottom, quantification shows higher COX-2 and mPGE 2 synthase levels in aged (above 65 years) compared to young (below 35 years) human MDMs ( n = 6 donors per group; ** P = 0.0030, * P = 0.0106, Student’s two tailed t -test). c , Top, representative immunoblot of two independent experiments quantifying EP1–EP4 in young and aged human MDMs; last lane, HEK cells transfected with EP receptor cDNA as a positive control. Bottom, quantification shows increased EP2 in aged (over 65 years) compared to young (below 35 years) human MDMs ( n = 6 donors per group; **** P < 0.0001, Student’s two tailed t -test). d – f , Quantification of basal respiration and ECAR of human MDMs treated with ascending doses of the EP1 agonist iloprost ( d ), the EP3 agonist AE248 ( e ) and the EP4 agonist AE1329 ( f ) for 20 h ( n = 5 donors per group). g , h , Dose response of the brain-impermeant EP2 antagonist PF-04418948 ( g ) and the brain-penetrant EP2 antagonist C52 ( h ) in human MDMs at 20 h. Data are represented as box plots (5–95 percentile); one-way ANOVA for OCR and ECAR, P < 0.0001; Tukey’s post hoc test for PF-04418948: ** P = 0.0083, *** P = 0.0005, # P < 0.0001; Tukey’s post hoc test for C52: # P < 0.0001 ( n = 5 donors per group). i , LC–MS quantification of PGE 2 levels in the plasma and cerebral cortex of aged (18–20 months) and young (3–4 months) mice. **** P < 0.0001 by two-tailed Student’s t -test ( n = 6 mice per group) j , LC–MS quantification of PGD 2 , PGF 2a and prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF 1a ) in the cerebral cortex of young and aged mice ( n = 5–6 mice per group). k , Left, Representative immunoblot of EP1–EP4 levels in mouse peritoneal macrophages isolated from young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months) mice; last lane, HEK cells transfected with EP receptor cDNAs as a positive control ( n = 6 mice per group). Right, EP2 is selectively upregulated in aged mouse peritoneal macrophages, similar to aged human MDMs in c ; ** P = 0.0018 ( n = 6 mice per group).

Data are mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise specified. a , MFI quantification from three independent experiments for the anti-inflammatory markers CD71 and EGR2 and pro-inflammatory markers CD80 and CD86 in young (3–4 months) and aged (20–23 months) Cd11bCre and Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice ( n = 10,000–20,000 cells per point; n = 3 mice per group). Two-way ANOVA: effects of genotype and age P < 0.0001; Tukey’s post hoc test ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001. b , c , Quantification of immune factors in plasma ( b ) and hippocampus ( c ) comparing aged Cd11bCre and aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice; * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 by two-tailed Student’s t -test ( n = 6 mice per group). d , Representative immunoblot and quantification from two independent experiments comparing EP2 levels in 6-month-old Cd11bCre and wild-type mice ( n = 6 per group). e , Primary latency in the Barnes maze for the five learning trials ( n = 10 (young), n = 11 (aged Cd11bCre), n = 7 (aged Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox ). f , Representative immunoblot and quantification of hippocampal presynaptic proteins synapsin and SNAP-25 and postsynaptic proteins PSD95 and CamKIIα; # P = 0.0005, *** P = 0.0006, **** P < 0.0001 by two-tailed Student’s t -test ( n = 6 mice per group; 20–23-month-old mice). g , Input/output curves as a measure of basal synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus ( n = 8 slices, 3 mice per group). h , PGE 2 activation of the EP2 receptor activates AKT signalling through phosphorylation of Ser473. Activated pAKT (Ser473) inactivates GSK3β through inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser9. Inactivation of GSK3β leads to constitutive activity of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) and glycogen synthesis. Conversely, deletion or antagonism of EP2 receptor signalling leads to downstream inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser641, Ser645 and Ser649 on GYS1 by activated, non-phosphorylated GSK3β. i , Quantification of EP2, pAKT (Ser 473)/total AKT, pGSK3β (Ser9)/total GSK3β and pGYS1 (Ser 641, 645, 649)/GYS1 levels in peritoneal macrophages from 6-month-old Cd11bCre and Cd11bCre;EP2 lox/lox mice; *** P = 0.0002, **** P < 0.0001 by two-tailed Student’s t -test ( n = 6 mice per group).

Data are mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise specified. a , Representative immunoblots and quantification of the EP2–AKT–GSK3β–GYS1 signalling pathway in mouse peritoneal macrophages isolated from 6-month-old wild type C57B6/J mice treated with EP2 antagonist C52 (100 nM), EP2 agonist butaprost (100 nM) or PGE 2 (100 nM) for 20 h. b , Quantification of a ; P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s post hoc test ** P = 0.0072, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001 ( n = 6 mice per group). c , Quantification of glycogen levels in human MDMs (age (mean ± s.e.m.) 43.9 ± 3.451 years) treated with EP2 agonist butaprost (100 nM) or EP2 antagonist C52 (100 nM) for 20 h. P < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s post hoc test **** P < 0.0001 ( n = 9 per group). d , LC–MS analysis of human MDMs (age (mean ± s.e.m.) 43.9 ± 3.451 years) treated with C52 (100 nM, 20 h) demonstrates upregulation of proximal glycolytic pathway (G6P, F6P, F-1,6-BP) and GSH and downregulation of UDPG and GSSG. Red circles represent metabolites with fold change >1.5, blue circles with fold change <1.5; q -value < 0.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction ( n = 6 donors per group). e , Enrichment pathway analysis of d using MetaboAnalyst. f , Schematic depicting U- 13 C-glucose metabolism via glucose-1P (G1P) and UDP-glucose to glycogen synthesis (yellow shaded box) versus flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway (green shaded box), glycolysis or lactate, and the TCA cycle (blue shaded box) with associated mass-labelled molecules. Glucose is labelled at all 6 carbons (in green; M+6) and is converted via the glycolytic pathway to two molecules of pyruvate (or M+3). Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria and undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield acetyl-CoA (M+2) which enters the TCA cycle.

Activation of EP2 signalling with butaprost increases incorporation of heavy glucose in glycogen precursors G1P and UDP-glucose and reduces labelling of glycolytic intermediates (F-1,6-BP and pyruvate) as well as TCA cycle intermediates (citrate and succinate); inhibition of EP2 with C52 conversely reduces synthesis of glycogen precursors and increases glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates. h , Schematic depicting changes in glucose metabolism in Fig. 2h , i . i , Representative flow cytometry histograms and corresponding MFI quantification of human MDMs with or without the EP2 inhibitor C52 (100 nM, 20 h) from three independent experiments.

Data are mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise specified. a , Human MDMs with or without LPS treatment (100 ng ml −1 , 20 h; n = 4 (veh), n = 4 (veh + C52), n = 5 (LPS), n = 7 (veh + LPS) donors per group, age (mean ± s.e.m.) 42.3 ± 8.212 years) were stimulated with or without C52 (100 nM, 20 h). Blockade of EP2 does not rescue OCR and ECAR in LPS-treated human MDMs. b , 13 C-glucose isotope tracing of human MDMs with or without LPS (100 ng ml −1 , 20 h) and with or without C52 (100 nM, 20 h), demonstrates reprogramming of the TCA cycle towards increased production of itaconate with LPS stimulation that is not reversed with EP2 inhibition ( n = 3 donors per group). c , Hierarchical clustering of glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites in human MDMs with or without LPS (100 ng ml −1 , 20 h) and with or without C52 (100 nM, 20 h) ( n = 3 donors per group). d , Model highlighting differences in glucose metabolism and the TCA cycle in LPS-stimulated macrophages versus aged macrophages. LPS stimulation upregulates glycolysis and lactate production and increases itaconate production from aconitate by cis -aconitate decarboxylase, the protein product of Irg1 , which is highly induced in settings of inflammation; increased itaconate suppresses SDH. In aged human MDMs, glucose is diverted from glycolysis to glycogen, reducing glucose flux into the TCA cycle; ageing is characterized by low SDH activity arising from deficient SIRT3 deacetylation of complex II subunits as a result of declining NAD + levels 17 . In both cases, lower succinate dehydrogenase activity leads to accumulation of the pro-inflammatory TCA cycle intermediate succinate, which enhances pro-inflammatory gene expression by stabilizing the transcription factor HIF-1α. e , Diagram illustrating fuel substrates for the TCA cycle and mitochondrial OXPHOS. Glucose and pyruvate/lactate can feed into the TCA cycle via acetyl-CoA; glutamine is metabolized via anaplerosis to α-KG, a TCA cycle intermediate. f , Young (below 35 years) and aged (over 65 years) human MDMs received U- 13 C-glucose [M+6] for 20 h. Isotope tracing reveals young macrophages can incorporate significantly higher 13 C from glucose into the TCA cycle compared to aged macrophages ( P = 0.0026 by Student’s two-tailed t -test with Welch’s correction for 13 C citrate[M+2] proportion in young versus aged cells; n = 3 donors per group). g , Young (below 35 years) and aged (over 65 years) human MDMs received U- 13 C-pyruvate [M+3] for 20 h.
