A second X chromosome contributes to resilience in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease

# Abstract
A major sex difference in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is that men with the disease die earlier than do women. In aging and preclinical AD, men also show more cognitive deficits. Here, we show that the X chromosome affects AD-related vulnerability in mice expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), a model of AD. XY-hAPP mice genetically modified to develop testicles or ovaries showed worse mortality and deficits than did XX-hAPP mice with either gonad, indicating a sex chromosome effect. To dissect whether the absence of a second X chromosome or the presence of a Y chromosome conferred a disadvantage on male mice, we varied sex chromosome dosage. With or without a Y chromosome, hAPP mice with one X chromosome showed worse mortality and deficits than did those with two X chromosomes. Thus, adding a second X chromosome conferred resilience to XY males and XO females. In addition, the Y chromosome, its sex-determining region Y gene ( Sry ), or testicular development modified mortality in hAPP mice with one X chromosome such that XY males with testicles survived longer than did XY or XO females with ovaries. Furthermore, a second X chromosome conferred resilience potentially through the candidate gene Kdm6a , which does not undergo X-linked inactivation. In humans, genetic variation in KDM6A was linked to higher brain expression and associated with less cognitive decline in aging and preclinical AD, suggesting its relevance to human brain health. Our study suggests a potential role for sex chromosomes in modulating disease vulnerability related to AD.

## INTRODUCTION
The expansion of translational neuroscience to investigate sex differences and their mechanistic underpinnings is of major consequence to human health ( 1 ). Understanding what makes one sex more vulnerable (or resilient) to aging and disease unravels new pathways to target with treatments that could benefit both sexes.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition and a global health threat. In the absence of effective medical treatments, more than 50 million men and women worldwide will suffer from this devastating condition by 2050 ( 2 ). The burdens of the disease combined with failed clinical trials ( 3 ) warrant a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous nature of AD, with the goal of developing better therapies.

Being male or female, defined here as harboring a different sex chromosome complement (XY versus XX), is an understudied biologic variable that contributes heterogeneity to AD. Sex differences in AD reveal differing vulnerabilities in men and women ( 4 , 5 ). Many more women have AD, largely due to their longevity ( 6 ) as they live to advanced ages, when AD risk and incidence is highest. In contrast, men with the disease die earlier in populations worldwide, indicating a male disadvantage with early-onset ( 7 - 9 ) and late-onset ( 10 , 11 ) subtypes of AD. Furthermore, in aging and preclinical AD before the age of 85 years, men show worse cognition ( 12 ), more cognitive decline ( 13 - 15 ), and increased measures of neurodegeneration ( 16 ), despite similar deposition of amyloid and tau ( 15 , 17 ), the pathological hallmarks of AD. This could underlie higher prevalence ( 18 ) and earlier onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in men compared to women in some populations ( 19 , 20 ). Here, we assess sex-biased mortality in AD by meta-analysis, investigate whether sex chromosomes affect vulnerability in a mouse model of AD, and test whether an X chromosome gene influences cognition in this mouse model.

## RESULTS
We conducted a meta-analysis of data collected on mortality in human populations worldwide. Only longitudinal studies that defined the time variable as age of disease onset or duration of disease after onset were included; cross-sectional studies were excluded. Our meta-analysis showed that male sex increased risk for death in AD by 62% compared to female sex [male hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, CI 1.45 to 1.84, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1 ]. We then examined mortality in transgenic mice that expressed mutated forms of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) (line J20) ( 21 ) and exhibited premature death, cognitive impairments, and pathological markers of the disease. Male hAPP mice died significantly earlier than did female hAPP mice on two genetic backgrounds, C57BL6/J ( P < 0.001; Fig. 2A ) and a mixed F1 generation of C57BL6/J crossed with FVB/N ( P < 0.05; fig. S1 ).

Men and women undergo depletion of circulating gonadal hormones with aging ( 22 - 24 ), but mice do not ( fig. S2 ) ( 25 , 26 ). Because AD is a disease of aging, we simulated human reproductive aging in male and female nontransgenic and hAPP mice by gonadectomy to deplete circulating hormones ( Fig. 2B ) and assessed survival in gonadectomized male and female hAPP mice. Male hAPP mice still died significantly faster than did female mice ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2C ). We explored whether hAPP mice showed a sex difference in cognitive functions independent of gonadal hormones. To reduce confounders, equalize hormones between sexes, and model reproductive aging of humans, we gonadectomized all nontransgenic and hAPP mice.

We tested spatial learning and memory of gonadectomized mice in the Morris water maze and found that hAPP mice were impaired ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2D ). However, male hAPP mice traveled significantly longer distances to find the hidden platform than did females, indicating poorer learning capacity ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2D ). In a probe trial, male hAPP mice lacked memory retention, in contrast to all other groups ( Fig. 2E ). All mice located the target platform equally well when visible ( Fig. 2D ), and male and female mice within each group swam at equal speeds, although hAPP mice overall swam marginally slower ( P < 0.001; fig. S3A ).

In passive avoidance testing, which measures hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent fear memory, male hAPP mice, but not females, quickly reentered the dark chamber where they received a shock during training ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2F ). Male hAPP mice, but not females, lost the fear memory ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2 , G and H ). Male vulnerability to deficits was significant with gonadectomy at young, middle, or old life stage ( P < 0.05 to P < 0.001; fig. S4 ), across a range of cognitive and behavioral tasks ( P < 0.05 to P < 0.001; fig. S4 ), and in an independent transgenic line of hAPP mice, hAPP-J9, which showed milder deficits ( P < 0.05; fig. S5 ) ( 21 , 27 , 28 ).

Male hAPP mice showed significantly decreased expression of the neuronal activity–related protein calbindin ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2I ) in the hippocampus. Male and female hAPP mice did not differ in soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) ( Fig. 2J ) or protein expression of hAPP, total tau, and phospho-tau in the hippocampus ( figs. S6 , A to D , and S7 ) when cognitive and behavioral deficits had emerged (3 to 4 months). They also did not differ in amyloid plaque deposition ( Fig. 2 , K and L , and fig. S8 ) during middle age (14.5 to 15 months); however, females tended to show more plaques at a very old age (24 to 27 months) ( fig. S9 ) as previously observed ( 29 ), despite decreased behavioral deficits compared to males.

We examined hAPP mRNA expression in the presence and absence of gonads and found that hAPP mRNA expression was equivalent across the experimental groups ( fig. S10 ). Therefore, any unintentional gonadal hormone influences at the promoter of hAPP-J20 mice were not observed, a critical measure when directly comparing sexes in transgenic disease models.

To dissect the etiology of male disadvantage related to AD after gonadectomy, we examined Four Core Genotype (FCG) ( 30 , 31 ) mice. In normal mice and humans, the Sry gene on the Y chromosome encodes a protein that initiates development of testes followed by perinatal masculinization of the body and brain ( 32 ). In the FCG mouse model, Sry is transposed onto an autosome from the Y chromosome. This genetic manipulation enables generation of XX and XY mice, each with either female ovarian (F, −Sry) or male testicular (M, +Sry) development: XX(F) ovaries, XX(M) testes, XY(F) ovaries, and XY(M) testes. A sex difference that varies by gonads is gonadal sex–mediated; one that varies by chromosome complement is sex chromosome–mediated ( Fig. 3A ).

We crossed FCG mice with hAPP mice to produce eight genotypes that included the four sex genotypes with or without hAPP ( Fig. 3B ). After sexual differentiation and reproductive maturity, we gonadectomized mice and assessed survival, cognition, and biochemical markers ( Fig. 3C ). XY-hAPP mice sexually differentiated as either male (M, testicular phenotype, +Sry) or female (F, ovarian phenotype, −Sry) died faster than did XX-hAPP mice of either gonadal phenotype ( Fig. 3 , D to F ). In addition to the main effect of sex chromosomes, sex chromosomes interacted with gonadal phenotype in XY-hAPP mice. That is, XY-hAPP males (+Sry) survived longer than XY-hAPP females (−Sry) ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3G ), an effect not observed in XX-hAPP mice.

To determine whether sex chromosomes mediate male vulnerability to Aβ-related cognitive deficits, we tested mice in the Morris water maze. In finding the hidden platform, male or female XY-hAPP mice showed significantly worse learning than did male or female XX-hAPP mice ( P < 0.01; Fig. 3 , H and I , and fig. S11A ). In contrast, all nontransgenic mice without hAPP learned similarly ( Fig. 3 , H and I , and fig. S11A ). In a probe trial, XY-hAPP mice lacked memory retention ( Fig. 3 , J and K , and fig. S11B ), whereas all XX (nontransgenic and hAPP) mice remembered, regardless of being male or female ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3J and fig. S11B ). All mice swam at equal speeds and located a visible target platform equally ( fig. S3 , B and C ). In passive avoidance testing, male or female XY-hAPP mice showed significantly worse fear memory than did male or female XX-hAPP and nontransgenic mice ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively; fig. S12 ). As in non-FCG hAPP mice, male or female XX and XY mice did not differ in the amount of soluble Aβ in the hippocampus ( fig. S6E ) at the age of cognitive and behavioral testing.

To further dissect causes of the sex chromosomal effects, we determined whether the presence of a Y or the lack of a second X chromosome conferred male disadvantage in hAPP mice. We investigated the XY* model ( 33 , 34 ) of sex chromosomal biology in mice with and without hAPP. The Y* chromosome in XY* males contains an altered pseudoautosomal region that recombines abnormally with the X chromosome during meiosis. Progeny of XY* males crossed with XX females include four sex genotypes roughly equivalent to the following: XX and XO mice with ovaries and XY and XXY mice with testes. A sexual dimorphism that varies by the presence or absence of a Y is Y chromosome–mediated; one that varies by the presence of one versus two X’s is X chromosome–mediated ( Fig. 4A ).

We crossed XY* males with hAPP females to produce eight genotypes of mice exhibiting varying dosages of X and Y chromosomes, with or without hAPP ( Fig. 4B ). We gonadectomized mice and then assessed survival, cognition, and biochemistry ( Fig. 4C ). Mice with one X chromosome (XY-hAPP and XO-hAPP) died significantly faster than did those with two X chromosomes (XX-hAPP and XXY-hAPP) ( P < 0.01; Fig. 4 , D to F ). Therefore, the addition of an X chromosome to XY-hAPP mice prevented male vulnerability, extending survival to that observed in XX-hAPP females. In addition to the main effect of X dose ( P < 0.01; Fig. 4E ), but not of Y ( Fig. 4F ), the Y interacted with the X; that is, XY-hAPP mice survived longer than XO-hAPP mice ( P < 0.01; Fig. 4G ).

We then tested whether the addition of an X to XY-hAPP mice reduced male vulnerability to cognitive deficits in the passive avoidance task ( Fig. 4 , H to J ). Both male and female hAPP mice with one X chromosome (XY-hAPP and XO-hAPP) showed significant forgetting of fear memory ( P < 0.05; Fig. 4 , H to J ), whereas those with two X chromosomes (XX-hAPP and XXY-hAPP) did not forget ( Fig. 4 , H to J ). In contrast, all mice without hAPP had comparable and robust fear memory. As in FCG-hAPP mice, XY*-hAPP mice with 1X or 2X chromosomes did not differ in the amount of soluble Aβ in the hippocampus ( fig. S6F ). Thus, although hAPP mice with 1X or 2X chromosomes had comparable amounts of Aβ, hAPP mice with 2X chromosomes were less impaired.

We sought to understand how a second X chromosome could confer resilience, because XY and XX mice express only one active X due to X-chromosome inactivation in females. Whereas X-chromosome inactivation silences one X chromosome in mammalian XX cells, a small subset of X-linked genes escape X-chromosome inactivation and show transcription from both alleles, leading to higher expression in females ( 35 - 38 ). Of those, we focused on the gene lysine-specific demethylase 6a ( Kdm6a ; also known as Utx ) encoding an H3K27 demethylase that consistently escapes X-chromosome inactivation in both mice and humans ( 39 , 40 ). Loss-of-function mutations in KDM6A cause cognitive deficits in humans ( 41 - 46 ), and Kdm6a plays a post-developmental role in mouse synaptic plasticity and cognition ( 47 ).

We therefore examined Kdm6a expression in mouse brains. We first confirmed that Kdm6a escaped X-chromosome inactivation in the XX mouse brain through RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) ( 48 ) in mouse primary cortical neurons. Isolated XX neuronal nuclei with Xist RNA coating the inactive X chromosome, indicating X-chromosome inactivation, showed Kdm6a labeling at two sites, marking its transcription from both the active and inactive X chromosomes ( Fig. 5A ). In contrast, XY neurons showed only one site for transcription ( Fig. 5A ). Immunolabeling of Kdm6a protein in the adult hippocampus of XX and XY mice with a well-characterized antibody ( 49 ) showed a largely neuronal cytoplasmic staining pattern that was diffuse in both XX and XY mouse brains ( Fig. 5B ).

We assessed whether two X chromosomes increased expression of Kdm6a protein and mRNA in mouse hippocampus. Kdm6a protein expression was significantly higher in XX mice than in XY mice as measured by two antibodies ( P < 0.05; Fig. 5 , C and D ). To determine whether the second X chromosome primarily governed higher expression, we assessed Kdm6a mRNA in FCG and XY* mice. As anticipated ( 50 , 51 ), hippocampal Kdm6a was significantly elevated in XX mice with testes and ovaries ( P < 0.001; Fig. 5E ). The presence of neither hAPP nor the Y chromosome altered this primary X-chromosome effect ( Fig. 5F ).

We explored whether KDM6A mRNA expression was altered by sex in the brains of individuals with and without AD. We queried gene expression from a public dataset (GSE 15222; tables S1 and S2 ) accounting for age, postmortem interval, and sex. KDM6A expression was significantly higher in pathologically confirmed AD cases relative to controls in the temporal cortex, an area affected in early AD ( P = 3.64 × 10 −4 ; Fig. 6A ). This increase was independently confirmed in two other public datasets of human postmortem gene expression in the temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus ( tables S1 and S3 ). In contrast, regions typically affected later or spared in AD such as the cerebellum showed no changes ( tables S1 to S3 ). We then assessed KDM6A expression in brains of individuals identified as male or female in the GSE 15222 dataset. KDM6A expression was higher in females with ( P = 4.83 × 10 −4 ; Fig. 6B ) and without AD ( P = 9.79 × 10 −4 ; Fig. 6B ).

We then queried whether KDM6A expression, by proxy of a genetic variation, was associated with cognitive change over time. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) online portal of gene expression across tissues of nearly 1000 individuals ( 52 ), we searched for common variants associated with altered expression of KDM6A . The minor allele of one genetic variant, rs12845057, was associated with increased expression of KDM6A in the brain ( P = 7.0 × 10 −6 ). Frequency of the minor allele (A) is about 14% globally and 7% in Europeans ( 53 ). To test associations between the KDM6A variant and cognitive change, we queried the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset derived from a multisite study of individuals with both whole-genome sequencing and serial neuropsychological examinations ( n = 778) that is enriched for individuals with MCI, a transition phase to AD. The minor allele was distributed equally among categories of cognitively normal ( n = 268), MCI ( n = 465), and AD ( n = 45) individuals, indicating that it did not associate with disease risk (cohort demographics; table S4 ). Next, we used linear mixed-effects regression models to test for an association between the minor allele A of the KDM6A variant and cognitive change, accounting for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 dose. Increasing dose of the minor allele of the KDM6A variant was significantly associated with less cognitive decline over time using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (β = 0.141, SE 0.035, P = 0.00005; Fig. 6C ). This finding was consistent in another cognitive measure using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) in overall function using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes score (CDR), when assessing women only in all measures ( fig. S13 ), and when assessing cognition in cognitively normal and in MCI individuals as subgroups ( table S5 ).

We next turned to experiments with primary wild-type mouse neurons exposed to recombinant Aβ1-42. The Aβ preparation was enriched for oligomers during the experimental time frame, based on our previous characterization ( 54 ). XY mouse neurons were more vulnerable to Aβ-induced toxicity, in a dose-dependent manner, compared to XX neurons, using both the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay ( P < 0.001; Fig. 7A ) and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay ( P < 0.01; fig. S14 ). In parallel with in vivo findings, neurons derived from XY* mice with one X chromosome (XY and XO) were significantly more vulnerable to Aβ toxicity than those with two X chromosomes (XX and XXY) ( P < 0.001; Fig. 7 , B and C ). The protective effect of two X chromosomes was decreased by the Y chromosome ( P < 0.05; Fig. 7B ), indicating an X:Y interaction.

Given that Kdm6a escapes X-chromosome inactivation in XX mouse neurons and is increased in XX compared to XY mouse brains, we tested directly whether Kdm6a modulates neuronal susceptibility to Aβ toxicity in vitro. In XX mouse neurons, we decreased Kdm6a expression ( P < 0.01; Fig. 7 , D and E ) to that found in XY neurons via lentivirus-mediated knockdown. Knockdown of Kdm6a in XX mouse neurons significantly worsened dose-dependent Aβ toxicity ( P < 0.01; Fig. 7F ) to a range observed in XY neurons. In XY mouse neurons, we increased Kdm6a expression to that found in XX neurons or higher ( P < 0.01; Fig. 7 , D and G ) via lentivirus-mediated overexpression. Overexpression of Kdm6a in XY mouse neurons significantly attenuated dose-dependent Aβ toxicity ( P < 0.001; Fig. 7H ) to a range observed in XX neurons.

We next determined whether increasing expression of Kdm6a attenuated male vulnerability to cognitive deficits in XY-hAPP mice. We gonadectomized XY nontransgenic and hAPP mice, injected lentivirus with (Kdm6A-OE) or without (control) the Kdm6a transgene bilaterally into the dentate gyrus, a region that affects spatial learning and memory, and analyzed mice behaviorally 1 month later ( Fig. 8A ). Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of Kdm6a in XY males increased Kdm6a mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus ( P < 0.05; Fig. 8B ) to that expected in XX females. In finding the hidden platform of the Morris water maze, XY-hAPP-Kdm6a-OE mice showed significantly better performance than XY-hAPP control mice measured by latency ( P < 0.001; Fig. 8C ) and learning ( P < 0.05; Fig. 8D ), quantified by comparing the last day of training to the first. Similarly, XY-hAPP-Kdm6a-OE mice showed significantly better learning than did XY-hAPP control mice measured by distance ( P < 0.001; Fig. 8 , E and F ), although distance curves did not statistically differ. In a probe trial, XY-hAPP-Kdm6A-OE mice showed robust spatial memory retention, compared to XY-hAPP control mice ( P < 0.01; Fig. 8 , G and H ) performing similarly to unimpaired nontransgenic mice. With the visible platform, hAPP mice swam marginally faster with longer distance than did nontransgenic mice; however, overexpression of Kdm6a did not alter either measure in either genotype ( fig. S3 , D and E ). Further, increasing Kdm6a expression in XY mice did not alter hAPP-induced hyperactivity in the open field task and increased time spent in open arms in the elevated plus maze in hAPP mice ( fig. S15 ).

## DISCUSSION
Our data suggest a role for sex chromosomes in mice in countering deficits and toxicity related to AD in both sexes. A second X chromosome decreased mortality and brain dysfunction in gonadectomized male and female hAPP mice, without altering soluble Aβ or co-pathogenic proteins. A second X chromosome conferred resilience, in part, through the candidate gene Kdm6a , a histone demethylase gene that escapes X-chromosome inactivation, causing higher expression in cells with two X’s compared to one X. Genetic variation of KDM6A linked to its increased brain expression was associated with slower cognitive decline in an aging population of individuals, including those with MCI.

Dissection of sex differences and their mechanistic underpinnings with powerful genetic tools provides opportunities to understand disease and unravel new sex-based pathways ( 55 ). Male sex is a major, underappreciated risk factor for rapid progression to death in AD ( 7 - 11 ), as confirmed by our meta-analysis ( Fig. 1 ), and in other neurodegenerative conditions ( 56 - 59 ). These findings do not contradict the fact that more women have AD due to their longevity ( 6 ) and their increased risk or incidence after age 85 ( 4 , 5 , 12 , 60 ), which together contribute to a higher lifetime risk of AD in women compared to men ( 61 ). When men get AD, they die faster ( 7 - 11 ). The male brain may be biologically older and more vulnerable, an idea supported by epigenetic ( 62 ) and metabolic studies ( 63 ) of humans.

In aging and preclinical AD, male sex may increase the likelihood of abnormalities favoring transition to clinical dementia. Men show worse memory function ( 12 ) and cognitive decline than do women ( 13 - 15 ), implying less compensation for similar subclinical brain pathology measured by positron emission tomography imaging of amyloid ( 12 , 15 ). In studies of AD biomarkers ( 64 ), men show increased neurodegeneration ( 16 , 17 ), a precursor for dementia. These findings could underlie earlier onset and increased incidence or prevalence of MCI observed in men from many ( 19 , 20 , 65 - 67 ), although not all ( 68 - 70 ), populations.

Recent studies of aging and AD [reviewed in ( 4 )] indicate similar amyloid amounts in the brain ( 12 , 15 , 17 , 71 , 72 ) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ( 71 ) of men and women, similar overall tau burden ( 73 ), but increased CSF and regional tau in women with high amyloid ( 71 , 73 ). Likewise, AD pathology is similar between the sexes, up until older ages ( 72 ), when both pathology and risk of AD increases in women. Each sex may respond differently to comparable amounts of pathogenic proteins, a possibility observed in mice ( 74 ), which may explain why with similar tau loads, men show less neuro-structural preservation ( 75 ) and more cognitive impairment ( 76 ).

Congruent with human observations, soluble Aβ and amyloid deposition were similar between the sexes in our mice until very old age and did not explain male vulnerability at the neuronal or cognitive level. Other AD mouse models show very high amounts of Aβ with increased mortality in female mice ( 77 - 80 ) and are thus incongruent with our mouse findings. Given that no single model of AD fully recapitulates human AD, a disease with a wide clinical spectrum, we conducted cellular viability, cognitive, behavioral, synaptic, and mortality studies that collectively showed worse outcomes in primary neurons and gonadectomized male mice, a sex bias that persisted in our hAPP mice regardless of age at hormone depletion, mouse strain, or genetic background. Our mouse studies focused on hAPP/Aβ-dependent abnormalities, representing a specific component of AD, a complex disease comprising multiple pathogenic proteins and risk factors.

We used gonadectomy to equate gonadal hormones between the sexes and simulate human reproductive aging, an approach distinctly different from previous studies of sex in AD-related models [reviewed in ( 81 )]. Gonadectomy enables direct comparison of the sexes without confounding due to activational (short-acting) effects of ovarian and testicular hormones. This is of value, because ovarian hormones modulate Aβ, network dysfunction, and cognitive deficits in female hAPP mice ( 82 , 83 ). Our experiments did not test the activational effects of hormonal treatments [reviewed in ( 82 , 83 )].

Sex chromosomes largely governed sex differences in vulnerability to mortality, cognitive dysfunction, molecular impairments, and cellular dysfunction in the FCG-hAPP mouse model. The XY genotype in hAPP mice that developed with ovaries or testes worsened measures, compared to the XX genotype that developed with ovaries or testes. Similarly, we recently found that sex chromosomes influenced mortality in mice during normal aging ( 84 ), suggesting action on fundamental pathways converging in aging and disease. The lack of a second X chromosome, rather than the presence of a Y chromosome, caused male disadvantage in animal and cellular models of AD in the XY* model. The presence of only one X chromosome (in XO females and XY males) consistently worsened hAPP/Aβ-related mortality, cognitive deficits, and cellular viability in both males and females, compared to two X chromosomes (in XX females and XXY males). The Y chromosome, the Y chromosome gene Sry, testes, or some combination of these decreased mortality in hAPP mice with one but not two X chromosomes. XY-hAPP males (+Sry) survived longer than did XY-hAPP females (−Sry) or XO-hAPP females (−Sry), indicating a potential protective role of the Sry protein or of testicular development itself in the XY, but not XX, genotype. Given that the X and Y chromosomes share homologous genes in pseudoautosomal regions, select Y genes may partially compensate for the lack of a second X chromosome.

Many factors influencing neural function reside on the X chromosome ( 85 ). Two X chromosomes could confer neural advantage through increased X dose arising from baseline escape of the inactive X chromosome. Whereas XY and XX organisms express one active X due to X-chromosome inactivation in females, select factors like the Kdm6a gene escape inactivation. Kdm6a is a histone demethylase that robustly and consistently escapes X-chromosome inactivation in female mice and humans ( 39 , 40 ) and is enriched in the brain ( 51 , 86 , 87 ). The second X chromosome increased Kdm6a expression, independent of gonads or the Y chromosome, in our mice. This is important, because the Y paralog of Kdm6a , UTY ( 88 ), has high homology to Kdm6a ( 89 ) but a nearly inactive histone demethylation domain ( 90 , 91 ). The presence of UTY in XY neurons and mice did not modify Kdm6a -mediated attenuation of AD-related toxicity in vitro or in vivo.

KDM6A expression in human brain was higher in females compared to males and in those with AD compared to controls. Because KDM6A loss-of-function mutations cause intellectual disability in humans ( 42 - 46 ) and Kdm6a elevation caused neural and cognitive resilience in our mouse studies, it is interesting to speculate that increased KDM6A in AD could be a protective, compensatory response.

A common genetic variant in an intergenic region near KDM6A , rs12845057, was associated with greater expression in human brain. The minor allele frequency varies across populations, and about 13% of females and 6.5% of males carry it globally ( 53 ). In the current study of the ADNI cohort, increasing the minor allele dose was associated with cognitive resilience in individuals undergoing longitudinal testing over a decade, a finding consistent across clinical measures and when we assessed females only. Our analysis in males, who carry half the frequency, was likely limited by statistical power. In our subgroup analyses by clinical diagnosis, individuals with MCI showed the most resilience associated with the KDM6A minor allele, suggesting that increased KDM6A could modify clinical trajectory during the transitional period from MCI to AD. Whereas the ADNI cohort includes longitudinal data and multisite investigations, its limitations include a study of predominantly non-Hispanic, Caucasian populations within the United States. How broadly our findings extend to other populations remains to be determined.

In the current study, modestly increasing Kdm6a expression in XY mouse primary neurons and hippocampus of XY-hAPP mice attenuated hAPP/Aβ neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that minor elevation in Kdm6a transcription was sufficient to functionally increase neural resilience and partially reverse deficits in the XY-hAPP mice. Whether this requires histone demethylase activity is currently unknown. Kdm6a may act differently across cell types and biological systems. Whereas Kdm6a deletion in hippocampus impairs synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice ( 47 ), its deletion in immune CD4 + T cells ameliorates the neuroimmune response in a mouse model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( 92 ). Thus, downstream actions of Kdm6a may be cell type specific.

Our study has several caveats and limitations. Our experiments do not exclude other potential contributions of X- or Y-based biological functions. A second X chromosome could contribute resilience through other baseline X escapee genes, epigenetic diversity derived from parent-of-X origin, or reactivation of the silent X chromosome. Furthermore, we did not study how the Y chromosome, its Sry gene, or testicular development contributed to a decreased mortality in hAPP mice with one X chromosome. Last, there are limitations to modeling AD in mice, including in each mouse model we used. Thus, we investigated several models and approaches, including mouse primary neurons, hAPP mice, human brain tissue expression data, and human cognitive data, and included several AD-related measures to increase the potential relevance of our findings. Collectively, these results imply that a second X chromosome, or genes that an X chromosome harbors, could contribute to counteracting AD vulnerability in both sexes.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
The objectives of our study were to probe the association of sex-based mortality risk in AD using meta-analysis; investigate whether sex chromosomes modify vulnerability related to AD in mice using molecular, cellular, neurogenetic, and behavioral approaches; and test in mice whether an X chromosome factor decreased male vulnerability related to AD. We used experimental models of AD (mice and their primary neurons) and human databases of both brain tissue expression and of clinical cognitive performance. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco and conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. For animal experiments, all studies were conducted in a blinded manner and included male and female mice across the lifespan in multiple cohorts at the ages and background strains indicated. Mouse studies used littermate controls along with randomization of mice, and experimentalists were blinded to the genotypes of the mice. In mouse studies, exclusion criteria (greater than 2 SDs above or below the mean) were defined a priori to ensure unbiased exclusion of outliers. We used transgenic mouse models of sex biology crossed with hAPP mice and also used mouse primary neurons exposed to varying doses of Aβ. We assessed several outcome measures including mortality, cognition, cell death, pathology, RNA and protein measures, and biochemistry. Cell culture treatments were carried out with vehicle or synthetic Aβ1-42 peptide previously characterized by atomic force microscopy, and relative neurotoxicity was assessed with MTT and LDH assays.

Our findings showing a statistical effect of the second X chromosome in contributing resilience across measures in mice and mouse primary neurons led us to study Kdm6a , an X-linked gene that escapes inactivation in mice and humans. We established that Kdm6a escapes X-chromosome inactivation in mouse primary neurons using RNA FISH. We then queried KDM6A expression in humans using established databases of brain tissues including the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and Mount Sinai School of Medicine Brain Bank (RNA sequencing), Gene Expression Omnibus (RNA microarray), and GTEx. We examined clinical and cognitive trajectories using the ADNI database to assess the relevance of our findings to the human condition. Last, we tested whether elevating the expression of Kdm6a causally contributed resilience to AD-related deficits in mouse primary neurons and hAPP mice using lentiviral gene delivery methods.

Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) for t tests and log-rank tests for survival analyses. For FCG-hAPP mouse and XY*-hAPP mouse survival statistical analysis, Cox proportional hazards models were applied to determine main effects, and a multivariate Cox model was used to test interactions of main variables on survival. R (nmle package) was used for analyses of variance (ANOVAs), post hoc tests, and meta-analysis. Differences between two means were assessed by two-tailed t tests for all experiments unless indicated otherwise in a replication cohort. Differences among multiple means were assessed by two-way ANOVA. A mixed-model ANOVA was used for analyses of Morris water maze data and included effects of repeated measures. Only significant P values were stated for two-way ANOVA results. Unless indicated otherwise, multiple comparisons of post hoc t tests were corrected for with the Bonferroni-Holm (stepwise Bonferroni) procedure to control for a family-wise error rate of α = 0.05. Linear mixed-effects models were fit in R ( 93 ) using the standard lme4 ( 94 ) package. In mouse studies, exclusion criteria (greater than 2 SDs above or below the mean) were defined a priori to ensure unbiased exclusion of outliers. Error bars represent ±SEM. Null hypotheses were rejected at or below a P value of 0.05. All analyses for KDM6A human studies were performed using R version 3.5.2 unless otherwise stated. We used linear mixed-effects modeling with random intercepts to test whether the genetic variant identified via GTEx as a modifier of KDM6A expression in brain also affected cognitive and clinical changes in the ADNI cohort. We covaried for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 dose.
