Genome-Encoded Cytoplasmic Double-Stranded RNAs, Found inC9ORF72ALS-FTD Brain, Propagate Neuronal Loss

# Abstract
Triggers of innate immune signaling in the CNS of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration (ALS/FTD) patients remain elusive. We report the presence of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (cdsRNA), an established trigger of innate immunity, in ALS-FTD brains carrying C9ORF72 intronic hexanucleotide expansions that included genomically encoded expansions of the G 4 C 2 repeat sequences. Presence of cdsRNA in human brains was coincident with cytoplasmic TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions, a pathologic hallmark of ALS/FTD. Introducing cdsRNA into cultured human neural cells induced Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and death that was rescued by FDA-approved JAK inhibitors. In mice, genomically encoded dsRNAs expressed exclusively in a neuronal class induced IFN-I and death in connected neurons non-cell autonomously. Our findings establish that genomically encoded cdsRNAs trigger sterile, viral-mimetic IFN-I induction, and propagated death within neural circuits and may drive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD patients.

## Cytoplasmic dsRNA evokes inflammation and death in human neural cells in vitro
To determine if G 4 C 2 cdsRNA is sufficient to induce IFN-I signaling in human neural cells, we transfected synthetic G 4 C 2 66-mer dsRNA into the cytoplasm of cells differentiated from human ReNcell VM neuroprogenitors ( 18 ); we have recently shown that these cells express markers characteristic of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes ( 19 ). Following G 4 C 2 dsRNA transfection, STAT1 was phosphorylated on Y701 (p-STAT1 Y701 ), a modification associated with activation ( fig. S6 ). We confirmed that dsRNA is localized to the cytoplasm by transfecting rhodamine-tagged dsRNAmi into differentiated human neural cells ( movie S1 ); 24 hours after dsRNAmi transfection, we observed induction of several ISG proteins, including MDA5, PKR, and p-STAT1 Y701 ( Fig. 2A ). By 48h, we observed dose-dependent death of human neural cells ( Fig. 2B ; S7 ; movie S1 ). Transfection of dsRNAmi into glutamatergic cortical-like neurons differentiated from the ReNcell CX human neuroprogenitor line also induced neural death after 48 h ( fig. S7D ). The presence of microglia was not required for death in either setting. To confirm that transfected dsRNAmi was being sensed by intracellular dsRNA PRRs, we generated a knockout of MDA5 by CRISPR-Cas9 ( fig. S8 ). We observed an ~30% decrease in dsRNA-mediated death ( Fig. 2C ), consistent with a role for MDA5 and redundancy of PRR function. The FDA-approved JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and tofacitinib blocked p-STAT1 Y701 and rescued neuronal death in a dose dependent manner ( Fig. 2D ). By contrast, inhibition of the double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase PKR by several small molecule inhibitors did not rescue neuronal death ( fig. S9 ). These data demonstrate that cdsRNA is sufficient to induce an IFN-I response and death in cultured human neural cells and that death can be rescued by either of three FDA-approved JAK inhibitors.

## Cytoplasmic dsRNA evokes inflammation non cell autonomously in neural circuits in vivo
To determine whether the presence of cdsRNA in neurons is sufficient to induce IFN-I signaling and neuronal death in vivo, we introduced antisense GFP RNA using an AAV9 vector ( 20 ) in mice expressing GFP exclusively in mature olfactory sensory neurons ((OSNs); Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP)-Internal Ribosome Entry Sequence (IRES)-GFP mice ( 21 ); fig. 2E ). As a negative control, we used an AAV9 vector of same serotype that expressed sense GFP and instilled it at the same viral titer into OMP-ires-GFP mice. As a second negative control we instilled AA9-anti-sense GFP into mice expressing tetracycline activator protein (TTA) - not GFP - from the OMP locus. Three to four weeks after viral infection, we observed cdsRNA via immunofluorescence in AAV9 antisense-GFP-infected animals, but not in the negative controls ( fig. 2F ). The presence of cdsRNA in a subset of neurons was associated with the induction of OASL2 (an ISG), as visualized by RNA in situ hybridization in both infected and adjacent mature neurons, as well as in immature neurons that had not been infected by the virus. These data show that dsRNA-meditated IFN signaling is transmitted to other cell types ( fig. S10 ). We also observed an ~30% reduction in mature OSNs in mice expressing cdsRNA relative to controls ( fig. 2F - H ). We conclude that cdsRNA encoding a nonpathogenic gene (GFP), but neither sense nor antisense RNA on its own, can induce an IFN-I response and promote cell death of neurons.

Are cdsRNAs encoded by the genome sufficient to elicit neuroinflammation and neuronal death in vivo? To address this we made use of two different transgenic mouse lines that fortuitously express cdsRNA in neurons due to structural rearrangement of an introduced transgene and flanking genomic DNA. The Neurodegeneration 1 (Nd1) ( Fig. 3A ; fig. S11A , C ) ( fig. S11B ) murine line expresses an isoform of human APP (hAPP) that increases production of amyloid Aβ peptide and the Nd2 line ( fig. S11B ) expresses an isoform that reduces Aβ peptide production (relative to wild type). Transgene expression was induced specifically in mature OSNs by crossing the Nd1 and Nd2 lines to an OMP-IRES-TTA background ( 22 ), ( fig S11A , B ). Deep-sequencing on whole genome jumping libraries with ~2kb size-selected DNA inserts ( 23 ) showed that the transgene in Nd1 animals had undergone a complex genetic rearrangement with more than two breakpoints, two deletions, and at least one inversion ( Fig. 3A ). We did not detect structural alterations in the transgene of a related mouse line that overexpresses an hAPP isoform using the same genetic strategy ( 24 ), but does not induce neurodegeneration ( fig. S11E ). Sequencing showed that the Nd2 transgene locus had also undergone complex rearrangements with possible inversions. In contrast, a related mouse line, which carried an uncomplicated simple insertion of the same transgene as Nd2, experienced no neurodegeneration ( 24 ).

We observed cdsRNA in neurons by immunofluorescence in Nd1 and Nd2, but not the related mouse lines with structurally intact (non-rearranged) transgenes ( Fig. 3B ; fig. S12A ). To confirm that the Nd1 transgene gives rise to dsRNA we generated cDNA libraries using dsRNA purified by dsRIP from cytoplasmic extracts of OE tissue. We then amplified inverted regions (which derive from the hAPP-expressing part of the construct) from these cDNA ( 13 ). As controls, we showed that inverted DNA could not be amplified when an isotype control antibody was used for immunoprecipitation or when the antibody against dsRNA was pre-incubated with a dsRNAmi competitor ( Fig. 3C ). Next generation sequencing of the isolated dsRNAome from Nd1 OE revealed sequences that were enriched in the inverted coding regions, identified by Sanger sequencing. Using RNA in situ hybridization, we also detected cytoplasmic expression of both sense and anti-sense mRNA from the Nd1 transgene ( fig. S13 ).

To determine if genomically encoded cdsRNA expression triggered ISGs, we profiled the transcriptomes of OSNs isolated from Nd1 and littermate controls by RNA-seq ( 25 - 27 ). The IFN-I antiviral signaling pathway was the most upregulated pathway in Nd1 relative to littermate control mice ( Fig. 3D - F ; Fig. S14 ; tables S4 - 5 ). We confirmed these results using RNA in situ hybridization against three ISGs, Stat1, Oasl2, and Ifi44, and showed that they were induced across the entire olfactory epithelia (OE; Fig. 3E ). ISG expression was confirmed by Western blotting for p-STAT1 Y701 , PKR, MDA5, and MAVS in Nd1 OE relative to littermate control mice ( Fig. 3F ; fig. S15A ). Stat1, Oasl2, and Ifi44 were also highly expressed in OSNs of Nd2 mice, but not control transgenic mice ( fig. S16 ). While IFNα and IFNγ induced signaling share similar pathways, our RNA-seq data showed that IFNα4 and IFNα12, but not IFNγ or IFNβ, were elevated in Nd1 neurons ( table S6 ), consistent with dsRNA-induced IFN-I induction.

Cytosolic PRRs bind endogenous cdsRNAs ( 28 , 29 ) and activate a positive feedback loop that increases expression of the receptor genes themselves ( 30 ). We found that PKR and MDA5 protein quantities were elevated in the OE of Nd1 mice (relative to littermate controls) and MDA5 and RIG-I mRNA quantities were induced in Nd1 OSNs ( Fig. 3F ; table S4 ). Activation of MDA5 and RIG-I lead to the degradation of the mitochondrial anti-viral signaling (MAVS) protein ( 29 , 31 , 32 ). Consistent with these mechanisms, we found that MAVS protein quantities were reduced by 70% in Nd1 animals compared to littermate controls ( Fig. 3F ; fig. S15A ). These data suggest that cdsRNA expressed from the transgene genomic loci activates PRRs in Nd1 mice.

In addition to IFN-I induction in the OE, we observed robust IFN-I signaling in the olfactory bulb (OB) of the brain, where OSN axons terminate ( Fig 4A ). In the anatomically orderly structure in the OB ( Fig 4A ), elevated Oasl2 expression is present in at least three structures: (i) periglomerular interneurons synapsed by OSNs axon termini; (ii) mitral cells that are a postsynaptic target of OSNs, and (iii) granule interneurons that do not directly synapse with OSNs in either Nd1 ( Fig. 4D ) or Nd2 ( fig. S17A ) mice. We confirmed that the transgene is not expressed in these neuronal types and thus, that it must induce expression in a non-cell-autonomous manner ( Fig. 4A - C ). IFN-I induction in the brain is associated with increased density of microglia ( 33 ), and we observe an increased density of Iba1 staining cells in the OB of Nd1 mice ( fig. S18 ). Thus, genomically encoded cdsRNA expressed exclusively in one class of neurons evoked IFN-I signaling in postsynaptic and other downstream neurons connected in a neural circuit in vivo.

## Non-cell autonomous neuronal death evoked by genomically encoded cdsRNA
In addition to IFN-I induction, both Nd1 and Nd2 mice exhibited profound neuronal death. Cleaved-caspase 3 (CCASP3) was increased ~2-fold relative to littermate controls, ( Fig. 5A ; fig. S12B , C ). The steady-state quantities of OSNs in both Nd1 ( Fig. 5B ) and Nd2 mice ( fig. S12B ) at 90 days of age were reduced by 40% relative to age-matched controls. Remarkably, <1% of OSNs expressed the transgene ( Fig. 3B ; 5C ; fig. S11C , D ). The loss of nearly half of OSNs in mice in which transgene expression is limited to <1% of the population demonstrates a robust non-cell-autonomous neurodegenerative process.

The inducible nature of the transgenes in the Nd1 and Nd2 lines afforded critical controls that supported cdsRNA as essential for neuronal death. First, by repressing transgene expression via oral administration of doxycycline we could demonstrate that transgene expression was necessary and sufficient for neuronal death ( Fig. 5A ). Second, we could rule out that greater quantities of transgene protein products accounted for neuronal death in the Nd lines relative to their non-neurogenerative control lines ( fig. S19 ). Third, we could demonstrate that genomic changes caused by transgene integration, so-called position effects, were not responsible for neuronal loss because mRNA expression was necessary ( Fig. 5A ). Fourth, we could show that transgene expression did not interfere with neurogenesis, as it was elevated in the Nd1 mouse relative to controls as the expected homeostatic response to neuronal death ( fig. S20 ). Fifth, we established that the half-life of OSNs was reduced in Nd1 mice relative to controls ( fig. S20 ).

Since ruxolitinib reversed dsRNA-mediated death of the FDA-approved JAK inhibitor in human neural cells, we tested if ruxolitinib reverse could reverse the non-cell autonomous IFN-I induction and neuronal death in Nd1 mice. After treating adult Nd1 mice with ruxolitinib by oral gavage for 5 days, we found significant reductions in CCASP3 staining in OSNs (p < 0.0002; fig. S21A ) relative to vehicle control treated mice. To confirm that ruxolitinib acted to reduce non-cell autonomous IFN-I signaling, we found marked reductions in phospho-STAT1 immunostaining ( fig. S21B ). Together, reversal of the neuronal death and IFN-I signaling in greater than 1% of OSNs indicates that ruxolitinib blocks the non-cell autonomous propagation of neuronal death mediated by sparse expression of a genomically encoded cdsRNA, and demonstrates the translational potential of ruxolitinib in neurodegenerative disease.

## Propagation of neuronal death and cdsRNA to connected neurons in vivo
Non-cell autonomous death evoked by genomically encoded cdsRNA extended beyond the nose and into the brain. The OBs of Nd1 and Nd2 mice were approximately 20% smaller by weight as compared to littermate controls ( Fig. 5D , E ; fig. S19B , C ). We immunostained fixed tissues for CCASP3 and γH2AX - a marker of damaged DNA that exhibits a pan-nuclear staining pattern (rather than the more common punctate staining) in cells undergoing apoptosis ( fig. S22 ) ( 34 ). We observed an 80% increase in pan-nuclear γH2AX staining and in CCASP3 in neurons in Nd1 bulbs ( Fig. 5F , G ; fig. S22 ). Taken together, these data confirm that both IFN-I signaling and neuronal death taking place in one neuronal subtype within a neural circuit can propagated to connected and neighboring neurons.

Time-course studies of mRNA and dsRNA in the Nd1 mouse revealed the surprising stability of cdsRNA in vivo. Using oral doxycycline, we suppressed the Nd1 transgene in 3 month old mice and found that mRNA and encoded proteins were undetectable within 2-3 days ( Fig. 6A ). In contrast, cdsRNA was present at about half of its original quantity by 30 days after transgene suppression ( Fig. 6B ). We hypothesized that cdsRNA can be transported down axons to connected neurons. Consistent with this idea, we observed detectable expression of MDA5 protein in axon bundles of OSNs of Nd1 mice but not littermate controls ( Fig. 6C ). In the OB, we found cdsRNA in the second order olfactory neurons of Nd1 mice, and we were able to immunoprecipitate dsRNA encoding the Nd1 transgene from the OB ( Fig. 6D , E ), even though the transgene is not expressed in these cells ( Fig. 4A - C ). MAVS protein quantities were also dramatically reduced in Nd1 mouse OBs ( Fig. 6F ), suggestive of dsRNA PRR activation in the OB, although TLR3 activation in response to extracellular dsRNA cannot be excluded. We conclude that genomically encoded dsRNA can also propagate inflammatory signals to connected neurons.

## Discussion
In this paper we show that genomically-encoded cdsRNA in neurons can elicit sterile inflammation resulting in both cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous neural cell death. This mechanism, which involves dsRNA in the cytoplasm, is distinct from the recently reported accumulation of dsRNA in the nucleus in response to overexpression of the PR dipeptide derived from the antisense strand of the C9ORF72 G 4 C 2 expansion ( 35 ). It therefore represents an additional mechanism of G 4 C 2 pathogenesis complementary to repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of dipeptide repeats, RNA foci, and loss of function of the C9ORF72 protein itself ( 36 ). These four mechanisms may act in concert to promote neuronal death. For instance, increased DNA damage and splicing defects may increase the production of dsRNA molecules ( 37 , 38 ), the quantity of cdsRNA might be augmented by dysregulated nuclear cytoplasmic transport or transient nuclear envelope breakdown ( 39 ), and activation of PKR by cdsRNA can increase RAN translation of dipeptide repeat proteins ( 40 ). Derepression of transposons due to loss of nuclear function of TDP-43 ( 14 , 41 ) is another source of genomically encoded cdsRNAs (in addition to G 4 C 2 expansions) in familial and sporadic forms of ALS/FTD with cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions ( 42 ).

Our data nominate cdsRNA as a biomolecule able to propagate neuronal death within a neural circuit, from cells expressing cdsRNA to those that do not. The surprising stability of cdsRNA (as demonstrated in mice), relative to single stranded mRNA, coupled with its ability to activate the innate immune system, is like to contribute to its potency as an activator of pathologic responses in neighboring and connected cells. It is also likely that the cdsRNA found in glial and microglial cells in ALS/FTD brains can be generated both in situ and in neighboring cells. Such a mode of action is consistent with recent studies implicating viral dsRNA as a species responsible for propagated interferon signaling ( 43 ) in Herpes Simplex Virus-1 infections. Secreted cytokines, such as interferon, and prion-like proteins in the IFN-I signaling cascade with low complexity domain proteins ( 44 , 45 ) may also function in concert with cdsRNA to propagate innate immunity and neuronal death characteristic of neural circuit dysfunction.

Our demonstration that genomically-encoded cdsRNA can mediate neurodegeneration implicates neurons as an activator of the neuroinflammatory cascades observed in ALS/FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that cumulative, age-dependent processes, such as genomic instability ( 46 ), latent viral reactivation ( 47 , 48 ), and derepression of endogenous repeat elements, such as retrotransposons and inverted Alu repeats ( 41 , 49 ), may work in concert to raise the quantities of genomically encoded cdsRNA within neurons and other types of CNS cells. At some point, amounts of cdsRNA cross a threshold where activated innate immune signaling triggers neuronal death; this is reflected in dose-dependent induction of STAT1 phosphorylation and right shift of dose-dependent death triggered by cdsRNA in cultured human neural cells. Crossing this threshold via gradual accumulation of cdsRNA over years to decades may require subsequent pathologic impact on astroctyes, microglia, and neurons and may account for the adult onset of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this view, individuals carrying C9ORF72 G 4 C 2 expansions experience accelerated production of cdsRNA relative to non-carriers, and reduced amounts of C9ORF72 in these carriers might lower the threshold where innate immune activation triggers neuronal death ( 50 , 51 ).

Our study has number of limitations. Our analysis of human tissue was limited to a few brain regions and did not include spinal cord tissue. While we amplified sequences adjacent to the C9 G4C2 hexanucleotide repeats from isolated cdsRNA from C9orf72 human brains, our analysis did not include a full characterization of the isolated cdsRNA. Our mouse studies demonstrated that dsRNA encoded by the transgene in olfactory sensory neurons in the nose was present in neurons in the olfactory bulb in the brain, but the mechanisms of propagation between primary and secondary olfactory neurons require further characterization. The absence of microglia in our cell culture model demonstrate that they are not necessary for the inflammation and neuronal death evoked by cdsRNA, their absence precludes understanding how microglia might alter these inflammatory and death phenotypes in vivo.

From a translational perspective, arrest of the neurotoxic arm of the innate immune response triggered by cdsRNA by pharmacologic intervention, with JAK inhibitors or other drugs, may lead to novel therapeutic strategies that slow neuronal death. We speculate that cdsRNA-dependent mechanisms will be relevant to a majority of sporadic and familial ALS patients, and to the substantial subset of AD patients, who have cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions ( 52 , 53 ). Further clarification of the sources of cdsRNA may also lead to RNA-based therapeutic strategies. The development of imaging and CSF biomarkers that detect and predict IFN-I activation has the potential to identify C9ORF72 carrier patients with disease prior to overt motor or cognitive deficiencies, which would enable a clinical trial to determine if asymptomatic patients are more likely to benefit from targeting neuroinflammatory pathways triggered by cdsRNA in the brain relative to patients with advanced disease.
