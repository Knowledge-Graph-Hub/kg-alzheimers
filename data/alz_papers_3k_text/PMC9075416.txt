# Title
L1CAM is not associated with extracellular vesicles in human cerebrospinal fluid or plasma

# Abstract
L1CAM is a transmembrane protein expressed on neurons that was presumed to be found on neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in human biofluids. We developed a panel of single-molecule array assays to evaluate the use of L1CAM for NDEV isolation. We demonstrate that L1CAM is not associated with extracellular vesicles in human plasma or cerebrospinal fluid and therefore recommend against its use as a marker in NDEV isolation protocols.

## Methods
This work was not considered human research and was approved by the Partners IRB and the Harvard University IRB. Biosafety protocols were in compliance with regulations of the Wyss Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Pre-aliquoted human plasma and CSF samples were ordered from BioIVT. For spike-and-recovery and dilution linearity experiments, individual CSF and plasma from BioIVT were used. For all other experiments, pooled CSF and plasma were used. Plasma or CSF was thawed at room temperature. Immediately after the sample had thawed, 100× Protease/ Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology) was added at a final concentration of 1× to the sample. The sample was then centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. Next, the supernatant was centrifuged through a 0.45-μm Corning Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filter (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2,000 g for 10 min to eliminate any remaining cells or cell debris.

Simoa assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Candidate capture antibodies were coupled to carboxylated paramagnetic beads from the Simoa Homebrew Assay Development kit (Quanterix) using EDC chemistry (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Candidate detection antibodies were conjugated to biotin using EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reagents were cross-tested for signal against the following recombinant proteins for CD9, CD63, CD81, L1CAM and albumin: ab152262 (Abcam), TP301733 (OriGene), CD81 OriGene TP317508 (OriGene), TP311601 (OriGene) and ab201876 (Abcam) on a Simoa HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix). The antibody pairs that gave the highest signal-to-background ratio were further validated by two means: first, plasma and CSF were serially diluted in sample buffer to demonstrate endogenous dilution linearity ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Sample buffers used for each assay were as follows: CD9 (30% Quanterix Neuroplex 3A diluent and 70% Quanterix Sample and Detector Diluent), CD63 (Quanterix Diluent E), CD81 (Quanterix Diluent E), L1CAM (Quanterix Sample and Detector Diluent) and albumin (Quanterix Sample and Detector Diluent). Next, the recombinant protein used in the calibration curve was added to diluted plasma and CSF, using the respective assay diluent, at two different concentrations to determine whether spike and recovery was within 70–130% ( Supplementary Table 1 ).

For CD9, CD63, CD81 and L1CAM assays, samples were incubated with immunocapture beads (25 μl) and biotinylated detection antibody (20 μl) for 35 min. Next, six washes were performed using System Wash Buffer 1 (Quanterix), and beads were resuspended in 100 μl streptavidin-labeled β-galactosidase (Quanterix) and incubated for 5 min. The concentrations of streptavidin-labeled β-galactosidase used for each assay were as follows: CD9 (120 pM), CD63 (120 pM), CD81 (150 pM), L1CAM (150 pM) and albumin (10 pM). An additional six washes were performed, and beads were resuspended in 25 μl resorufin β- d -galactopyranoside (Quanterix) before being loaded into the microwell array.

For the albumin assay, samples were incubated first with immunocapture beads (25 μl) for 15 min and then washed six times. Subsequently, 100 μl detection antibody was incubated with the beads for 5 min. Next, six washes were performed, and beads were resuspended in 100 μl streptavidin-labeled β-galactosidase (Quanterix) for a final 5-min incubation. An additional six washes were performed, and the beads were resuspended in 25 μl resorufin β- d -galactopyranoside (Quanterix) before being loaded into the microwell array.

Data collection was conducted using Excel version 16.47.1, while analysis and graphing were conducted using Prism version 8.4.3.

Simoa assays were transferred to a plate-based ELISA for comparison. Capture antibody was diluted in ELISA Coating Buffer (BioLegend) at a concentration of 4 μg ml −1 , and a volume of 100 μl was coated per well on a Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plate (BioLegend). Plates were incubated with capture antibody overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the plate was washed three times with 200 μl PBST (0.5 ml Tween-20 in 1 l PBS). Sample was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The plate was again washed three times with 200 μl PBST. The corresponding detection antibody (100 μl) was added to the plate, which was left to incubate for 1 h. The detection antibody was then removed, and the plate was washed three times with 200 μl PBST. Streptavidin-labeled β-galactosidase (100 μl) from the Simoa Homebrew Assay Development kit (Quanterix) was then added, and the plate was incubated for 30 min. The plate was then washed five times with 200 μl PBST and incubated with 100 μl resorufin β- d -galactopyranoside, also from the Simoa Homebrew Assay Development kit (Quanterix), for 20 min in the dark. Plates were then imaged with a Tecan plate reader using Magellan version 7.2 software at excitation and emission wavelengths of 555 nm and 605 nm, respectively.

Sepharose CL-6B resin (GE Healthcare) was washed with PBS. Briefly, a volume of resin was washed with an equal volume of PBS in a glass jar and then placed at 4°C to let the resin settle completely (several hours or overnight). PBS was then poured off, and new PBS was again added for a total of three washes. Columns were prepared fresh on the day of use. Washed resin was poured into an Econo-Pac Chromatography column (Bio-Rad) to obtain a 10-ml bed volume. The column was allowed to drip out until the column was solid, at which time the top frit was placed securely at the top of the resin but without compression. PBS was then added at 1 ml above the frit until the sample was ready to be added.

Once prepared, all columns were washed with at least 20 ml PBS in the column. When the sample was ready to be loaded, the column was allowed to fully drip out, and, after last drop, plasma or CSF was added to the column. Immediately thereafter, 0.5-ml fractions were collected. As soon as the plasma or CSF completely passed through the frit, PBS was added to the top of the column 1 ml at a time. For plasma and CSF, fractions 6–19 were collected, while, for iNGN, fractions 6–15 were collected. For the comparison of Simoa, ELISA and western blot, one 0.5-ml sample was fractionated by SEC using an Izon qEVoriginal 35-nm column into 0.5-ml fractions (fractions 6–15). Each of the fractions was then divided evenly for use in the three techniques.

For Extended Data Fig. 4 , equal volumes of each SEC fraction were loaded on a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after adding Bolt LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and denaturing at 70°C for 10 min. The gel was run at 150 V for 60 min and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following primary antibodies were used for western blot at the corresponding dilutions in PBS with milk powder overnight at 4°C: MM2/57 for CD9 (MilliporeSigma) at 1:1,000, h5c6 for CD63 (BD Biosciences) at 1:1,000 and M38 for CD81 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1:666. After three washes with PBST, anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) was added for 2 h in PBS with milk powder at 1:2,000. After three more washes with PBST, the SpectraQuant-HRP CL Spray chemiluminescent detection reagent (BridgePath Scientific) was used to develop western blots. Imaging was performed on the Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems).

For Fig. 2c , immunocapture of L1CAM from plasma and CSF was performed using the Dynabeads antibody coupling kit (Invitrogen, 14311D). Following the manufacturer’s instructions, either anti-L1CAM antibody (Abcam, ab272321) or anti-mCherry control antibody (Abcam, ab232341) were used. Four aliquots of 1 ml CSF or 0.375 ml plasma were incubated with beads at 4°C overnight with gentle rotation. Beads were washed four times with PBS and resuspended in LDS with reducing buffer. Immunocaptured plasma and CSF L1CAM as well as human brain lysate and iNGN cell lysate were loaded on a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after adding Bolt LDS sample buffer with reducing buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and denaturing at 70°C for 10 min. The gel was run at 150 V for 120 min and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following primary antibodies were used for western blot at the corresponding dilutions in milk overnight at 4°C: UJ127 (Abcam) at 1:2,000 and 2C2 (Abcam) at 1:500. After three washes with PBST, anti-mouse cross IgG secondary antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) was added for 2 h in milk buffer at 1:2,000. After three more washes with PBST, SpectraQuant-HRP CL Spray chemiluminescent detection reagent (BridgePath Scientific) was used to develop western blots. Imaging was performed on the Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems).

SEC was performed on 1 ml plasma, and fractions 7–10 were pooled. This solution (200 μl) was used for each of four conditions:

No treatment, 2-hincubation, lyse with 1% Triton X-100, 1-h incubation

Application of 100 μg proteinase K (Thermo Fisher), 2-h incubation, lyse with 1% Triton X-100, 1-h incubation

No treatment, 1-h delay, add PMSF to a final concentration of 2.5 mM for 1 h, lyse with 1% Triton X-100, 1-h incubation

Application of 100 μg proteinase K (Thermo Fisher), 1-h incubation, add PMSF to a final concentration of 2.5 mM for 1 h, lyse with 1% Triton X-100, 1-h incubation.

After the final incubation, each sample was diluted in Homebrew Sample Diluent (Quanterix) to a final volume of 800 μl and measured using Simoa assays for ALIX and albumin on the Quanterix HD-X instrument.

For DGC, an OptiPrep (iodixanol) gradient was prepared using the following layers (from top to bottom): 2 ml 5%, 3 ml 10%, 3 ml 20%, 3 ml 40% layers. Each layer of OptiPrep (MilliporeSigma) was diluted in a solution of 0.25 M sucrose (MilliporeSigma) and Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4 (MilliporeSigma). The sample (1 ml) was loaded on top of the 5% fraction. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 r.c.f. for 18 h at 4°C in 13.2-ml polypropylene tubes (Beckman Coulter). Fractions were removed from the top in 1-ml increments. To calculate the density of each fraction, 1 ml PBS was loaded on a gradient instead of sample. The refractive index of each fraction was measured with a refractometer after ultracentrifugation, and then density was calculated based on this measurement.

Plasma fractions 9 and 12 from SEC using a 10-ml Sepharose CL-6B column were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 2% uranyl formate. Samples were added to 400 mesh Formvar/Carbon Film Copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and liquid was wicked away using Whatman filter paper. Samples were imaged using a JEM-1400 120-kV transmission electron microscope (JEOL). Images were acquired using the AMT image capture engine V602 (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).

Excised gel bands around the size of 180–240 kDa were cut from a polyacrylamide gel and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis. Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile, and then acetonitrile was removed. Gel pieces were dried in a Speed-Vac, and a modified in-gel trypsin procedure was performed 13 . Samples were then reconstituted in 5–10 μl HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nanoscale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 2.6-μm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary with a flame-drawn tip 14 . Each sample was loaded with a Famos autosampler (LC Packings) onto the column. Peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), subjected to electrospray ionization and entered into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide sequences were determined by matching information from protein databases with the fragmentation pattern acquired by the software program SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 15 .

Previously described iNGN cells were grown in mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technologies) on Matrigel (Corning)-coated plates. Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in PBS and added to MTeSR1 medium at a final concentration of 0.5 μg ml −1 to initiate differentiation. On day 4 after doxycycline addition, the medium was changed to Gibco DMEM with GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with B-27 Serum-Free Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Gibco penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). On day 6, EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation, as previously described 16 , and resuspended in PBS.

For analysis of data from the Genotype–Tissue Expression database, preprocessed exon–exon junction read counts were obtained from the publicly available version 8 database ( https://GTExportal.org ). The read table was filtered to include only junctions falling within the body of L1CAM , and these counts were analyzed using custom Python scripts available upon request. Reads aligning to L1CAM (chrX:153,859,517-153,888,173) were visually examined using the Integrative Genomics Viewer 17 to assess evidence for the inclusion or exclusion of exon 25.

Experiments included in the figures of this paper represent a single experiment. However, these experiments were reproduced multiple times by different operators using different biological samples, and the same results were observed. Specifically, the SEC results in Fig. 1 were replicated more than six times. The density gradient experiment as well as the western blot experiment in Fig. 2 were each replicated two times with similar results.
