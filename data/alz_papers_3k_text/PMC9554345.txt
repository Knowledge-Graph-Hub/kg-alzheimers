Reversal of synapse loss in Alzheimer mouse models by targeting mGluR5 to prevent synaptic tagging by C1Q

# Abstract
Microglia-mediated synaptic loss contributes to the development of cognitive impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the basis for this immune-mediated attack on synapses remains to be elucidated. Treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) silent allosteric modulator (SAM), BMS-984923, prevents β-amyloid oligomer–induced aberrant synaptic signaling while preserving physiological glutamate response. Here, we show that oral BMS-984923 effectively occupies brain mGluR5 sites visualized by [ 18 F]FPEB positron emission tomography (PET) at doses shown to be safe in rodents and nonhuman primates. In aged mouse models of AD ( APPswe/PS1ΔE9 overexpressing transgenic and App NL-G-F /hMapt double knock-in), SAM treatment fully restored synaptic density as measured by [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 PET for SV2A and by histology, and the therapeutic benefit persisted after drug washout. Phospho-TAU accumulation in double knock-in mice was also reduced by SAM treatment. Single-nuclei transcriptomics demonstrated that SAM treatment in both models normalized expression patterns to a far greater extent in neurons than glia. Last, treatment prevented synaptic localization of the complement component C1Q and synaptic engulfment in AD mice. Thus, selective modulation of mGluR5 reversed neuronal gene expression changes to protect synapses from damage by microglial mediators in rodents.

## INTRODUCTION
Despite the millions of individuals afflicted, there remains no disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Evidence of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide accumulation is required for AD diagnosis ( 1 ); however, other hallmarks are misfolded TAU ( MAPT ) accumulation, phosphorylation and spreading, and microglial and astroglial reactivity ( 2 , 3 ). Genetic evidence from dominant early-onset AD mutations in amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) and presenilins, from Down’s syndrome, and from protective APP alleles are all consistent with a causative role for Aβ ( 4 ). Biomarker studies found Aβ accumulation 2 decades before symptoms, suggesting an early role for Aβ in disease pathophysiology ( 5 ). However, the temporal disconnection between Aβ accumulation and symptoms, as well as the clinical failure of multiple Aβ-lowering therapies have expanded the focus of AD pathophysiology. Genetic studies implicate microglia in AD risk and progression. For example, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) signaling has been shown to exert multiple effects on Aβ-driven pathology ( 6 ). In addition, classic complement cascade components have been directly implicated in phagocytic synaptic removal in AD ( 7 ), although the basis of synaptic selectivity is not defined.

Crucial for clinical AD progression from presymptomatic to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia is the loss of synapses ( 8 , 9 ). Synapse loss was initially documented ultrastructurally at autopsy, although it can now be tracked indirectly with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or directly by synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) PET ( 10 - 12 ). PET tracers targeting SV2A, which is ubiquitously expressed in synaptic vesicles, permit quantification of synaptic density from noninvasive scans, facilitating tracking of neurodegenerative disease progression and drug development. PET imaging with [ 11 C]UCB-J previously demonstrated reduced hippocampal synaptic density of patients with MCI relative to unimpaired controls ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) and was also able to detect drug rescue of synapse loss in a mouse amyloidogenic model [ APPswe/PS1ΔE9 ( 14 ); henceforth, APP/PS1] ( 15 ). The second-generation tracer, [ 18 F]SynVesT-1, with longer half-life, higher resolution, and greater potential for clinical translation, was able to discern differences in synaptic density between APP/PS1 mice and control littermates ( 16 ).

With regard to biochemical events at failing AD synapses, cellular prion protein (PRP C ) was identified as a high-affinity receptor for Aβ oligomers (Aβo) in an unbiased genome-wide expression cloning screen ( 17 ). PRP C exhibits a unique selectivity for oligomeric Aβ ( 17 - 24 ). In amyloidogenic AD mouse models, Aβo binding to PRP C contributes to synaptic plasticity impairment, learning and memory deficits, and synapse loss ( 17 , 25 - 29 ). Fyn and Pyk2 ( PTK2B ) kinases downstream of Aβo and PRP C have been previously linked to TAU ( 30 - 34 ) and implicated in AD risk ( 35 ). A screen for postsynaptic transmembrane proteins linking Aβo and PRP C to intraneuronal signaling identified neuronal metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) ( 23 , 36 - 45 ). Genetic loss and pharmacological inhibition studies have demonstrated that reduced mGluR5 activity alleviated synaptic and memory deficits in multiple amyloidogenic AD mouse models ( 25 , 36 , 37 , 40 - 42 , 46 - 54 ). However, the molecular and cellular bases mediating the role of mGluR5 in synaptic loss in AD, including neuroglial interactions and complement-driven synaptic phagocytosis, remain unclear.

Allosteric mGluR5 modulators have been subdivided into positive (PAMs), negative (NAMs), and silent (SAMs). PAMs enhance and NAMs suppress glutamate-induced G protein–mediated Ca 2+ mobilization and/or shift glutamate efficacy. Multiple NAMs reduce both physiological glutamate signaling and Aβo-PRP C –dependent synaptic deficits. As a dose-limiting side effect, blockade of glutamate at mGluR5 with a NAM impaired learning and memory independently of AD ( 36 , 55 - 60 ). We identified a SAM, BMS-984923, that does not alter basal or glutamate signaling ( 61 - 63 ) but does inhibit the PRP C -mGluR5 interaction to prevent pathological Aβo signaling ( 39 ). This SAM has the potential for expanding the therapeutic window for mGluR5 as a disease-modifying AD target.

Here, we use BMS-984923 to explore the connection between neuronal mGluR5 and glia-dependent synapse loss. We showed that altered expression of neuronal and glial genes modified neuroimmune interaction in murine amyloidogenic (APP/PS1) and AD {homozygous double knock-in strain [ APP NL-G-F /hMAPT ( 64 , 65 )]; henceforth labeled dKI} models, resulting in reduced synaptic density. Treatment with SAM restored synaptic density. Complement tagging of synapses destined for removal is reported to attract microglia and astroglia for phagocytosis of synaptic fragments ( 66 ). We showed here that SAM treatment prevented synaptic localization of C1Q without altering total C1Q amount or overall gliosis, suggesting that targeting mGluR5 might be effective for producing therapeutic effects in AD.

## RESULTS
Our previous data suggested that the mGluR5 SAM, BMS-984923, is able to reduce AD-related phenotypes in cell culture, brain slices, and amyloidogenic transgenic (TG) mice ( 39 ). Here, to assess mGluR5 receptor occupancy, we completed [ 18 F]FPEB PET in rhesus monkeys and in mice. In monkeys, single intravenous doses of SAM (0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) blocked mGluR5 in the brain in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1 , A and B ). Receptor occupancy from Lassen plots ranged from 27% for the 0.03 mg/kg dose to 94.4 ± 0.4% for the 1.0 mg/kg dose ( Fig. 1B ). Plasma total SAM concentrations were measured throughout the course of the scan. The full dose-response curve revealed that SAM bound to mGluR5 with an ED 50 (median effective dose) of 0.11 ± 0.02 mg/kg dose or with an IC 50 (median inhibitory concentration) of 24.8 ± 5.1 ng/ml total plasma concentration. Separate plasma protein binding studies indicated a free fraction of 0.1 to 0.5% in different species ( data file S1A ); therefore, the measured IC 50 value equates to a free drug concentration of about 0.3 nM, closely similar to the measured 0.6 nM K i (inhibition constant) for displacement of [ 3 H]MPEPy for in vitro mGluR5 binding ( 39 ). In mice, a single oral dose of SAM (7.5 mg/kg) administered 2 hours before [ 18 F]FPEB PET blocked brain mGluR5 with an average receptor occupancy of 98% across brain regions ( Fig. 1C ). To further assess occupancy of mGluR5, we tested the ability of SAM pretreatment to prevent PAM-induced seizures in mice ( 39 , 67 ). Doses at 3.75 mg/kg or above completely blocked mGluR5-PAM–induced seizures ( Fig. 1D ; ED 50 = 1.5 ± 0.8 mg/kg), whereas high doses of the chiral enantiomer of BMS-984923 (SAM enantiomer, eSAM, at 30 mg/kg) had no effect on seizures, demonstrating stereoselective receptor binding ( Fig. 1D ).

To evaluate the translational potential of SAM, pharmacokinetic, metabolic, selectivity, and toxicological analyses were pursued. Studies were conducted in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey to measure the plasma kinetics of SAM after intravenous and oral administration. We also assessed the metabolic stability and profile of SAM, and observed reduced stability in dog, which led us to choose monkey rather than dog as the second toxicology species ( data file S1B ). Metabolite profiling of SAM identified unchanged parent compound and 38 tentative minor metabolites across human and preclinical species; metabolic pathways observed in human were also observed in investigated preclinical species, and no major metabolite comprised more than 5% of total ( data file S1B ). Whereas plasma protein binding of SAM was >99% in rat, monkey, and human ( data file S1A ), oral bioavailability was 50 to 90%, and mouse brain concentrations were about twice plasma concentrations ( data file S1C ). Safety evaluation of SAM included a standard Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) mutagenic program, which demonstrated that SAM was not mutagenic ( data file S1D ). In addition, rats tolerated single oral doses of SAM at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg without relevant effects on neurobehavioral function, as evaluated using a modified Irwin test, or on body temperature ( data file S1E ). Repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 7 days in rat and monkey were used to set the dose for the GLP 28-day repeat-dose studies in both species. Rats received 5, 15, or 45 mg kg −1 day −1 , and monkeys received 10, 50, or 200 mg kg −1 day −1 . From the 28-day GLP studies, the no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL, data file S1E ) doses were 15 and 200 mg kg −1 day −1 for rat and monkey, respectively. The 28-day average maximum concentration and area under the curve values at the NOAEL are 10,700 ng/ml and 191,000 ng hour/ml in rat and 15,100 ng/ml and 169,000 ng hour/ml in monkey. The average exposure over 24 hours in monkey at NOAEL was more than 250-fold greater than the plasma IC 50 measured from the receptor occupancy study using [ 18 F]FPEB PET.

To further evaluate the specificity and selectivity of SAM, in vitro assays were completed to evaluate any potential interactions with other targets. SAM was tested in a total of 508 binding and cell-based functional assays in a CEREP panel using a single concentration at 10 μM in duplicate ( data file S1F ). Overall, SAM showed no affinity/potency or a selectivity >300-fold for all targets, with the exception of PAR1 (protease-activated receptor 1) and PR (progesterone receptor) for which there was a selectivity between 100- and 300-fold relative to the mGluR5 K i of 0.6 nM. We assessed the in vitro potential for SAM to be an inhibitor of the human transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic ion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, and BSEP, as well as the potential of SAM to be a substrate of the human transporter P-gp. The IC 50 ’s for each were all far above efficacious SAM concentrations, and SAM showed no evidence to be a P-gp substrate ( data file S1G ). Furthermore, we investigated potential CYP inhibition and activation from SAM parent and metabolite compounds and found that IC 50 ’s were all far above efficacious SAM drug concentration ( data file S1G ). SAM inhibited hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) in a GLP cell culture assay with an IC 50 of 1.14 μM, 1900-fold above efficacious exposure concentration ( data file S1H ). During an in vivo monkey cardiovascular study at doses up to 200 mg/kg, the QT interval corrected for heart rate was unaltered, and there was no observed effect on respiratory, central nervous system (CNS), or cardiovascular function. Thus, oral dosing with SAM occupied brain mGluR5 sites and was well tolerated at exposures more than 250-fold greater than required to occupy 50% of the mGluR5 receptor sites.

We sought to evaluate whether SAM rescue of preexisting synaptic density deficit in aged AD mice was observed by repeated synaptic PET imaging. Mice were aged to the point that synapse loss was detectable using SV2A PET, a tool for monitoring synapse density with clinical utility in AD and other conditions ( fig. S1 , A to C and G ). At 12 to 13 months of age, a comparison of baseline [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 PET found reduced [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 binding in the hippocampus (HC) and cerebral cortex (CX) of APP/PS1 relative to wild-type (WT) mice ( Fig. 2 , A to C ; P < 0.0001). Rescans of the same mice after a 1-month treatment with the mGluR5 SAM showed a significant ( P < 0.0001) increase in hippocampal [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 standardized uptake value ratio minus 1 (SUVR-1) in APP/PS1 compared to WT mice ( Fig. 2 , D to F ).

We also tested whether SAM had a chronic disease–modifying effect after treatment cessation by analyzing synaptic marker immunostaining. Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated for 1 month, followed by 1 month of drug washout, which is more than 60 halflives in mice. After 1 month of treatment, vehicle-treated TG animals exhibited significant ( P < 0.05) reduction of both the presynaptic marker SV2A and the postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), in both dentate gyrus (DG) and CX, compared with the WT, whereas synaptic markers in SAM-treated APP/PS1 animals were restored to WT amounts in all contexts ( P > 0.05), consistent with previously published results ( fig. S2 , A to E ) ( 39 ). This rescue persisted for at least a month after treatment cessation, as SAM-treated TG samples had significantly higher ( P < 0.01) synaptic density (with both SV2A and PSD-95 in both DG and CX) than vehicle-treated TG samples after drug washout ( Fig. 2 , G to K , and fig. S2 , F to H ). Together, the data showed a sustained disease-modifying benefit of blocking the PRP C /mGluR5 synaptic signaling pathway.

As APP mutant mice can have confounding issues resulting from overexpression, competition with endogenous genes, and transgenic promotors, we also tested a homozygous APP NL-G-F /hMAPT dKI strain ( 64 , 65 ). We repeated the mGluR5 SAM treatment from 12 to 13 months of age in dKI mice and assessed SV2A PET and synaptic immunohistology in different cohorts ( fig. S1 , D to G ). Baseline [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 PET found decreased synapse density in transgenic dKI mice compared to WT at 12 months of age ( Fig. 3A ), which was further confirmed by region of interest (ROI)–based analysis to be 19% lower hippocampal SUVR-1 in dKI mice compared to WT ( Fig. 3B , P < 0.01). In addition,1-month SAM treatment increased synaptic density by 17% as detected by posttreatment [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 PET compared to baseline PET in the same dKI mice ( P < 0.05) ( Fig. 3 , C and D ) to a density comparable to WT mice.

We sought to confirm the PET end point by immunohistological analysis. Both hippocampal and cortical sections of vehicle-treated dKI mice exhibited significantly ( P < 0.05) reduced SV2A and PSD-95 punctate staining relative to WT controls ( Fig. 3 , E to I , and fig. S3 , A to C ). In particular, 1-month treatment with SAM restored synaptic markers to amounts equal to that of WT mice. To the extent that the amount of the pre- and postsynaptic markers reflects synapse density, then the changes are expected to be similar in individual animals. SV2A and PSD-95 immunoreactivity strongly correlated with one another in both DG and CX from both APP/PS1 and dKI animal models ( fig. S4 , A to D ; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, SV2A staining in DG was significantly correlated with hippocampal SV2A PET SUVR-1 ( fig. S4E ; P < 0.0001), providing cross-validation of the two methods.

Multiple studies have provided clinical and preclinical evidence supporting an increased incidence of AD in females compared to males. One recent experiment investigating sex differences in AD concluded that the mGluR5 NAM, CTEP, blocked Aβ pathophysiology and improved cognitive declines selectively in male but not female APP/PS1 mice ( 54 ). In contrast, our SV2A PET studies showed rescue of synaptic density loss in females by treatment with SAM in both the APP/PS1 and dKI models of AD. To further investigate a potential sex difference, we carried out a meta-analysis of our SV2A and PSD-95 histology data segregated by sex ( fig. S5 , A to C ). Staining results from both synaptic markers in both DG and CX were compiled into a synaptic score for each individual animal (see Materials and Methods ). In the APP/PS1 cohorts ( fig. S5A ), the dKI cohorts ( fig. S5B ), and in an analysis of the two models combined ( fig. S5C ), both males and females were fully rescued by SAM treatment with highly robust statistical significance (AD-veh versus WT-veh: P < 0.01; AD-SAM versus WT-veh: P > 0.05).

To further confirm that these synaptic markers reflected synaptic density, we assessed the juxtaposition of SV2A and PSD-95 puncta in three dimensions using a modified SEQUIN method ( 68 ). For this purpose, we used super-resolution Airyscan microscopy in confocal Z series of double-stained sections of the CA1 from vehicle- and SAM-treated dKI mice and scored synapses as pairs of puncta stained with pre- and postsynaptic proteins within 250 nm of one another. We observed that SAM treatment significantly ( P < 0.05) increased the density of synaptic loci relative to vehicle-treated dKI ( Fig. 3 , J and K ). Thus, in multiple strains with multiple measures, blocking the mGluR5 pathway with SAM had a disease-modifying effect to support recovery of synaptic density.

We considered the extent to which our primary outcome, synapse density, matched with behavioral deficits in these mouse models. We have previously shown that recovery of synapse density associated with behavioral benefit after treatment with SAM in APP/PS1 mice ( 39 ). SAM rescued spatial memory in the Morris water maze, novel object memory, and passive avoidance learning. We also showed that rescue of APP/PS1 synapse density by the related mGluR5 NAM compound, MTEP, is accompanied by recovery of spatial memory and novel object memory ( 19 , 27 , 36 ). Here, we measured memory performance in the dKI model. At 3 months of age, the dKI mice exhibited no spatial memory deficit ( fig. S6 , A and B ), but 12-month-old dKI mice treated with vehicle for 1 month exhibited significantly impaired learning ( fig. S6C ; P < 0.0001) and could not recall a hidden platform location during a probe trial ( fig. S6D ). In contrast, age-matched dKI mice treated with SAM for 1 month spent significantly ( P = 0.0059) more time in the target quadrant than adjacent areas ( fig. S6C ). These memory phenotypes occurred without any effect of dKI genotype or SAM treatment on the ability to swim to a visual platform ( fig. S6E ). DG SV2A area was also positively correlated with spatial memory performance ( fig. S4F ; P = 0.048). Thus, the ability of SAM compound treatment to restore synapse density in both APP/PS1 and dKI mice correlated with recovery of spatial memory.

TAU hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles are key components of AD pathology and are thought to be driven by upstream Aβ synaptopathology in human brain and to synergize with Aβ for further synapse loss ( 69 - 71 ). However, many mouse amyloidogenic AD models (including APP/PS1) show little or no TAU pathology. The dKI strain inserts human MAPT into the mouse Mapt locus and shows increases in certain phospho-TAU (pTAU) epitopes without tangles ( 65 ). Therefore, we assessed pTAU pathology in the dKI strain and its response to SAM treatment. The dKI mice were previously shown to have higher AT8 immunoreactivity in cortical brain tissue ( 65 ). Here, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry and biochemistry that AT8 amounts were increased in cortical tissue from 12-month-old dKI animals ( Fig. 4 , A to D ; P < 0.0001). One-month SAM treatment significantly reduced AT8 in the CX ( Fig. 4 , C and D ; P < 0.05).

We evaluated two additional disease-associated pTAU markers in dKI brain sections. TAU phosphorylation at S396/S404 has been reported as an early event in AD progression ( 72 ), and the pT217-TAU epitope has been documented as a specific plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of AD tauopathy ( 73 ). pS396-TAU–positive area was significantly ( P < 0.0001) increased in dKI cerebral CX and in CA1, and this signal was decreased significantly ( P < 0.01) in CX by 1-month SAM treatment ( Fig. 4 , E to G ). pT217-TAU–positive area, although less than pS396-TAU, still showed accumulation ( P < 0.0001) in cerebral CX and in CA1, and was significantly decreased ( P < 0.05) by SAM treatment in both regions ( Fig. 4 , H and I ). Thus, rescue of synapse loss by SAM in the dKI model might, at least in part, be mediated by reduced pTAU accumulation; alternatively, reduced pTAU accumulation may be secondary, in part, to synapse recovery with SAM.

To explore the molecular underpinnings linking SAM treatment with synaptic recovery in an unbiased manner, we conducted deep single-nuclei transcriptomic analysis of amyloidogenic and AD models with and without mGluR5 SAM treatment ( Figs. 5 and 6 and figs. S7 to S13 ). We collected brain tissue from aged WT and APP/PS1 TG mice treated twice daily with either vehicle (V) or SAM (3.75 mg/kg) (D) for 1 month from 12 to 13 months of age (WTV, WTD, TGV, and TGD), as well as a separate cohort of similarly aged and treated WT and dKI animals (WTV, WTD, dKIV, and dKID) ( Fig. 5A ). Each group included four mice, and all were on a pure C57/Bl6J background. Cerebral CX and HC from each brain were dissected, and the two regions were processed together for each mouse. Nuclei isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation were processed for mRNA profiles with the 10X Genomics platform (~15,000 per sample). In total, nearly 500,000 nuclei were sequenced to a depth of ~20,000 reads each ( fig. S7 , A to D ). The resulting DNA sequences were processed in Seurat, and no confounding batch effects were observed ( fig. S8 , A and B ). Integrated data were clustered in Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) space ( fig. S8C ). Cell clusters were identified by canonical cell type markers, with at least three for each cell type ( fig. S8D ). The expression of one marker for each is shown ( fig. S8G ). Both models exhibited similar numbers and proportions of each cell type ( fig. S8 , E and F ).

We examined expression profiles for AD-associated and SAM-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across cell types. All cell types showed substantial changes induced by APP/PS1 or dKI compared to WT. For excitatory neurons (ExNs), a “volcano” plot revealed the pattern of up- and down-regulated genes in TGV or dKIV group compared to the WTV group ( Fig. 5 , B and D ). In contrast, many fewer DEGs were present in the comparison of SAM-treated TG or dKI samples with the WTV group ( Fig. 5 , C and E ). Indeed, 83 and 63% of AD-associated expression changes within ExNs of APP/PS1 and dKI samples, respectively, were corrected by SAM treatment ( Fig. 5F ). Expression patterns across the different groups for each DEG revealed that SAM treatment restored both up-regulated and down-regulated genes ( Fig. 5F ). Similar rescue was observed in inhibitory neurons (InNs) ( Fig. 5G ). The list of all SAM-corrected DEGs from ExNs and InNs and from either mouse model was analyzed for pathway enrichment with ClueGO ( 74 ). Differences in enrichment of networks composed of Gene Ontology (GO) cell compartment terms were detected ( fig. S9 , A to C ). Specifically, neuronal SAM–corrected DEGs were strongly enriched in GO terms related to neuronal synapses, with less prominently populated networks related to ribosome, V–adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and glial projection. This analysis is consistent with expected primary action of SAM and mGluR5 at neuronal synapses.

SAM-mediated correction was predominantly neuronal, because SAM treatment failed to correct most DEGs in each glia cell population analyzed ( Fig. 5 , H and I , and fig. S10 , A to C ). Increasing the threshold stringency for differential expression analysis had minimal effect on the proportion of SAM-corrected DEGs across cell types ( fig. S11 ), highlighting not only that SAM-mediated corrections were primarily neuronal but also that treatment corrected at least 73% of neuronal DEGs with the greatest fold-change difference, regardless of model.

To visualize differential expression transcriptome-wide between TGV, TGD, and WTV, the log fold change (logFC) for WTV compared to TGV (AD effect, x axis) was plotted against that for TGD compared to TGV (SAM effect, y axis) ( Fig. 6 , A to I , and fig. S12 , A to F ). In this plot, points along the identity line of slope = 1 are equal in TGD and WTV, indicating that there is complete rescue. Points along the line y = 0 reflect an AD-related phenotype unaffected by SAM treatment. Although the linear regression of all genes showed a highly significant difference from slope = 0 in every cell type examined ( P < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), the effect was much more pronounced in neuronal subtypes. For APP/PS1 ExN, the slope was 0.70 and Pearson R was 0.72, with close to full normalization by SAM ( Fig. 6B ). The regression of expression profiles for DEGs in InNs showed a slope nearly as close to 1. In these neuronal populations, most DEGs were corrected by SAM [colored pink (APP/PS1) or green (dKI)] and largely fell along the y = x identity line. In contrast, although the slopes in microglia and astrocytes were also significantly different from 0 ( P < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), they were substantially shallower than in neurons, because most DEGs failed to be corrected (black dots) ( Fig. 6 , B to I , and fig. S12 , A to F ).

Both the APP/PS1 and dKI models showed a substantial ( P < 2.3 × 10 −50 ) rescue of expression patterns by SAM, in correlation with synapse rescue by immunohistology and PET imaging ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). We compared the AD-related DEGs of all major cell types of the two models and found significant overlap in each context ( P < 4.8 × 10 −4 ) ( fig. S13 ). In ExN, the overlap of DEGs contained 46 genes ( fig. S10 , A and B ). Of these 46 core DEGs, most were expression-normalized by SAM in both models; 36 were rescued in APP/PS1, and 31 in dKI ( fig. S13B ). Thus, single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) profiling methods revealed robust expression changes across multiple cell types and pronounced global rescue by SAM treatment, but the rescue was far more complete in neurons than in glia.

Research into the role of glial cells in AD progression has identified expression signatures of disease-associated microglia (DAM) ( 75 ) and astrocytes (DAA) ( 76 ) in the 5XFAD TG amyloidogenic mouse model, each with unique transcriptomic profiles. Our data here demonstrated conservation of a subset of these characteristic DEGs in both cell types ( fig. S13 , G to I ). Although microglia from dKI animals had a higher number of DEGs relative to WT controls than did APP/PS1 (and thus greater overlap with DAMs), both mouse models had a similar number of overlapping DEGs with DAA.

Although our single-nuclei transcriptomic data revealed minimal glial normalization by SAM, activation of glial cells and C1Q synaptic tagging have been strongly implicated in AD synapse loss ( 7 , 77 , 78 ). We hypothesized that gliosis and complement release may still occur in the presence of SAM but that innate immune mediators might fail to target the expression-normalized neuronal synaptic elements. Specifically, the synapse-rescuing effect of SAM treatment might relate to a prevention of complement tagging of synapses rather than an upstream reduction of microgliosis or complement production. First, we examined whether the synapse-rescuing mGluR5 SAM normalized gliosis, C1Q amounts, or colocalization with PSD-95. We have previously examined astrocyte, microglia, and Aβ area in the hippocampi of treated and nontreated APP/PS1 mice and found that SAM treatment had no effect on gliosis or plaque load ( 39 , 79 , 80 ). Here, we obtained similar results for SAM-treated dKI ( fig. S14 , A to F ). IBA1 (a microglial marker; fig. S14 , A and B ), GFAP (an astrocyte marker; fig. S14 , C and D ), and thioflavin S (amyloid plaques; fig. S14 , E and F ) staining were significantly increased ( P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.0001, respectively) in 12-month-old vehicle-treated dKI animals, relative to WT, and none was affected by SAM treatment. To assess total C1Q protein, we completed C1Q immunoblots in the dKI and APP/PS1 samples with and without SAM treatment. Total C1Q in dKI HC samples was substantially increased in the vehicle-treated samples relative to WT, and this was not altered by the SAM treatment (dKI; Fig. 7 , A and B ; P < 0.0001).

To assess innate immune tagging of synapses by complement, we analyzed DG sections by super-resolution Airyscan microscopy with antibodies against C1Q and PSD-95 ( Fig. 7C ). At 12 months old, the fraction of PSD-95 overlapping with C1Q was significantly increased in both dKI ( Fig. 7D ; P < 0.0001) and APP/PS1 ( Fig. 7E ; P < 0.01) vehicle-treated mice, consistent with published reports in other models ( 7 , 81 , 82 ). In contrast, animals treated for 1 month with SAM exhibited PSD-95/C1Q colocalization that was reduced relative to vehicle-treated animals ( P < 0.05) and was indistinguishable from WT. C1Q overlap with the presynaptic marker SYNAPSIN 1/2 was also significantly elevated ( P < 0.05) in DG of vehicle-treated dKI mice and restored to WT amount in SAM-treated animals ( fig. S15 , A and B ). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that SAM normalization of synaptic signaling and neuronal gene expression in these amyloidogenic and AD models eliminates synaptic tagging by complement, despite persistent glial activation and C1Q production.

After synaptic tagging by C1Q, both astrocytes and microglia are thought to participate in synaptic removal by phagocytic mechanisms. One study highlighted a greater role for astrocytes in clearing synaptic debris and microglia for somatic debris ( 83 ). To assess astroglial engulfment of synaptic elements, brain samples from 12- to 13-month-old WT and dKI animals were costained with SV2A and GFAP after 1 month of treatment with vehicle or SAM ( Fig. 7 , F and G ). SAM-treated dKI samples exhibited significantly ( P < 0.05) lower SV2A signal contained within GFAP-positive astrocytes in CA1, relative to dKI-vehicle samples. Although SAM-treated dKI samples did exhibit reductions in astrocytic engulfment of SV2A, the engulfment was still significantly higher than WT samples ( Fig. 7G ; P < 0.0001). Together, SAM blockade of mGluR5-dependent and AD-selective synaptic signaling normalizes neuronal gene expression and is associated with reductions of both C1Q synaptic tagging and histologic evidence of synaptic engulfment.

## DISCUSSION
In the current study, we showed that synapse loss can be tracked using longitudinal PET imaging in rodents. Using this method, we found that synapse loss was mGluR5-dependent in both a MAPT gene KI AD mouse model and a TG amyloidogenic mouse model. The mGluR5 intervention was initiated after synapse density had declined at 12 months of age, and SAM treatment was able to reverse the deficit in reimaged mice. This disease-modifying benefit persisted for 1 month after washout and was coupled with reduced pTAU accumulation by dKI mice expressing human TAU. Mechanistically, single-nuclei transcriptomic profiling revealed normalization of neuronal signatures, but little change in glial cells. However, this does not imply that glial responses are separable from AD-related synapse loss. In contrast, the mGluR5-mediated neuronal changes eliminated the AD-dependent localization of C1Q to synaptic sites and reduced the AD-associated synaptic fragment engulfment by astrocytes. Our data support the hypothesis that the synapse-depleting neuroglial interaction in these amyloidogenic and AD models is prevented by mGluR5 blockade–dependent normalization of neuronal gene expression. However, we cannot rule out additional effects of SAM treatment on nonneuronal cells that were not detected by extensive expression profiling or immunohistology but contributed to synaptic density restoration. Of translational relevance, a subnanomolar potent and orally available mGluR5 SAM (BMS-984923) blocked this AD process, while preserving physiological glutamate signaling, and had a broad safety margin in toxicology studies. Thus, SAM-mediated correction of neuronal expression blocked C1Q synaptic localization and prevented synaptic engulfment to preserve synapses in rodent models.

Synapse loss is a robust biomarker of AD progression that correlates well with cognitive decline ( 8 - 12 ). Development of a noninvasive in vivo imaging approach to quantify synaptic density is essential for early diagnosis of AD. SV2A, a ubiquitously and homogenously expressed isoform of SV2, is found in synapses throughout the brain. Expanding on recent studies ( 16 , 84 , 85 ), we used longitudinal PET imaging with [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 to first demonstrate decreases in hippocampal synaptic density of two separate mouse models of amyloidogenesis and AD and then to show pharmacological rescue. These findings were confirmed using immunohistochemical staining of SV2A. The successful application of [ 18 F]SynVesT-1 in preclinical evaluation of treatment advances its utility as a tool for development of therapeutic agents of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and supports its development as a tool for diagnosis and assessment of AD disease progression.

Pharmacological rescue of synaptic density in aged APP/PS1 and dKI mice revealed that new synapses are being formed in these animals. It is documented by repeated in vivo two-photon imaging that aged WT mice ( 86 ) and aged APP/PS1 mice ( 87 ) continue to form dendritic spines and stabilize new synapses. Because new dendritic spines are continually gained and stabilized throughout aging, it is potentially possible to restore overall synaptic density by blocking the mechanisms underlying accelerated synaptic loss without an effect on synaptogenesis per se. On the basis of the acute effect of Aβo to drive dendritic spine loss and the ability of SAM treatment to prevent this acute loss ( 19 , 36 , 39 ), we favor the hypothesis that synaptogenesis is not altered by SAM but rather that increased density over time is due to a shift in the balance of gain and loss. The observation that SAM treatment of WT animals did not result in greater synaptic density is also consistent with a specific action to limit AD-related synaptic loss and thereby permit a net increase of synapse density over 1 month in the disease model.

In addition to synapse loss, microscopic pathological hallmarks of AD in humans include Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated TAU ( 2 , 3 ). APP/PS1 mice recapitulate amyloid phenotypes but do not develop TAU tangles. To assess SAM-mediated rescue of pathological TAU phenotypes, we previously treated 3×Tg mice ( 39 ). These mice express the human MAPT (P301L) transgene in addition to the APPswe transgene and a Psen1 transgene with the familial AD (fAD) M146V mutation ( 88 ). SAM treatment of aged 3×Tg mice reduced soluble p(S199/S202)-TAU and insoluble TAU. To extend this finding to a setting without overexpression or FTLD-mutant TAU, we used the homozygous dKI model APP NL-G-F /hMAPT . We confirmed pTAU accumulation and found that pTAU phenotypes were decreased by SAM treatment. We have previously shown that SAM treatment prevents aberrant activation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, PTK2B ) ( 39 ), a kinase linked to AD risk and reported to phosphorylate TAU at Y18 ( 89 ). In the amyloidogenic and AD models studied here, SAM treatment lowered Aβ-triggered TAU phosphorylation, at least in part by normalization of downstream Pyk2. SAM-mediated reduction of pTAU accumulation may contribute to restoration of synaptic density.

Previous studies support sex-dependent differences in AD incidence. Using APP/PS1 mice, a recent study found that negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 selectively improved cognitive decline in male but not female mice. However, our SV2A PET studies and extensive histological data found no difference between sexes in multiple brain regions using the same APP/PS1 background or the dKI model. One explanation for the difference in sex dependency between these studies relates to the use of a SAM in the current study at full receptor occupancy, in contrast to a NAM with attendant toxicity and dose limitation in the previous work. Pharmacokinetic and receptor occupancy were not monitored in the CTEP study ( 54 ). Nonetheless, it is clear that both male and female AD mice of different strains benefit from SAM treatment targeting mGluR5.

The list of genes altered in the AD mouse neurons and corrected by SAM overlaps strongly with data from human AD expression profiling. Nineteen of the 46 SAM-corrected ExN DEGs common to both models are human dorsolateral prefrontal CX ExN DEGs ( 90 ). A number of these genes have also been reported as AD biomarkers. Aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate A (ALDOA) function is down-regulated in AD hippocampal tissue ( 91 ) and is a CSF biomarker discriminating between AD and non-AD cognitive impairment ( 92 ). Calmodulin ( CALM1 ) is part of an intersecting subnetwork from four consensus modules of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CSF t-TAU/Aβ1–42 ratio in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) ( 93 ). CYSC ( CST3 ) correlates with CSF concentrations of Aβ42 and TAU ( 94 ) and is reduced in AD CSF ( 95 ). Prostaglandin D2 synthase/β-trace (PTGDS) is also reduced in AD CSF ( 95 ) and is part of network module with a positive correlation to AD in frontal CX tissue ( 96 ). The ATPase subunit ATP1B1 is included in a network module with a negative correlation to AD phenotypes ( 96 ). Malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) is elevated in AD CSF ( 97 ) and is a hub in gene networks contributing to AD ( 98 ). Heat shock protein 90 alpha family class B member 1 (HSP90AB1), a molecular chaperone, is a subnetwork node within an “amyloid neuropathies” network of AD ( 51 ). Integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) regulates glutamate release and synaptic function ( 99 ), whereas dominant ITM2B mutations cause familial British and Danish dementias, diseases with amyloid angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles ( 100 ). BRI2 (encoded by ITM2B ) binds APP and inhibits Aβ 42 aggregation ( 100 ). BRI2 is also increased in early-stage AD HC, and deposits are associated with Aβ plaques ( 101 ). CAMK2N1 is a potent and specific inhibitor of CAMKII in the postsynaptic density. CAMKII is downstream of the PRP C -mGluR5 signaling complex aberrantly activated by Aβo ( 38 ). Dysregulation of hippocampal CAMKII has been reported in AD ( 102 ).

Despite synapse recovery by SAM treatment, microglial and astrocyte gene expression and histologic changes in the amyloidogenic and AD models were altered by SAM to a minimal extent. Although there was a relative absence of glial changes, we cannot rule out direct effects of SAM on glial action as a potential contributing factor. However, even if SAM directly acts on glial cells, most AD-related transcriptional changes were observed selectively in neurons. This is consistent with glial activation being driven by amyloid accumulation rather than synaptic damage ( 103 ). Subsequent to glial activation in control AD mice, C1Q production tags synapses for engulfment by both astrocytes and microglia ( 7 , 104 ). C1Q and C3 were found to be up-regulated and colocalized to synapses in AD models, whereas inhibition of classic complement components blocked synapse loss. Consistent with these findings, we show here that preventing localization of C1Q to synapses by SAM treatment is sufficient to prevent synaptic engulfment. snRNA-seq analysis demonstrated that SAM treatment had the strongest effect in neurons, with minimal alterations to expression changes in glial cells. Specifically, neuronal SAM–corrected DEGs are enriched in GO terms related to synapses. Biochemical and histological analysis showed that C1Q, IBA1, and GFAP amounts were not altered by SAM treatment, supporting the transcriptomic data. Despite the persistence of gliosis and plaque density in SAM-treated samples, we showed elimination of the synaptic localization of C1Q and a reduction of synaptic engulfment markers in astrocytes. The observed reduction of synaptic engulfment by GFAP-positive cells may be sufficient for synaptic recovery by itself, although it is also possible that SAM treatment reduces engulfment by other glial populations not examined here, including microglia and other GFAP-negative phagocytic cells. Both multiple epidermal growth factor–like domains 10 (Megf10), a C1Q receptor, and MerTk contribute to astrocytic clearance of neuronal debris and synaptic elimination in developing and adult CNS ( 77 , 105 ). However, no expression changes in these receptors were detected in neurons in the current analysis. Among the genes differentially expressed in both amyloidogenic and AD models and rescued by SAM in both ExNs and InNs is CD47, a protein shown to inhibit complement-dependent synaptic pruning ( 106 ). Thus, normalization of the phagocytosis-inhibiting signal CD47 in neurons by SAM may contribute to synaptic protection. Although CD47 is normalized by SAM treatment in both models, the direction of differential expression in the two models is opposite (up-regulated in APP/PS1 neurons, down-regulated in dKI neurons), perhaps due to a later disease stage for APP/PS1 versus dKI. Regardless, rescuing the altered neuronal expression profile prevented synaptic tagging, effectively blocking complement-dependent synaptic loss.

Our study has limitations. Although we used two different strains, the data are derived from murine models that do not fully recapitulate human AD. In particular, the TAU phenotypes and cell death in these models are limited compared to the human condition. Human AD also has a substantially slower progression and much longer course than any murine model. The mouse strains are inbred, and mice were housed in conditions relatively free of pathogens. Thus, the translation of these studies to human requires detailed clinical investigation.

Although our snRNA-seq data were supported by histological evidence, most identified DEGs were not validated. Additional experiments are necessary to confirm the transcriptional changes and investigate whether these changes manifest at the protein level. Such experiments will also shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of synaptic engulfment, including specific C1Q receptors and the responsible cell types.

Although SAM rescue is mediated by mGluR5, we cannot rule out contributions of other Aβ cell surface receptors to neurodegeneration. This could potentially explain the failure of SAM treatment to fully rescue the observed increases in pTAU in the dKI model. Despite this, synaptic density was restored to WT levels in dKI mice, so these contributions must not be essential.

In conclusion, SAM is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Aβo-induced mGluR5 complex. Toxicological studies showed safety and tolerability at doses more than 250-fold above the dose required for 50% receptor occupancy in primate brain and for rescue of pathophysiological TAU, C1Q synaptic localization, synaptic engulfment, and synaptic depletion in mouse amyloidogenic and AD models. This work further reinforces that targeting an Aβo-induced mGluR5 complex can modify the course of AD and supports the advancement of SAM intervention into human testing ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT04805983 ). SAM treatment was shown to have a disease-modifying benefit, because synaptic density is maintained even after a month of drug washout. Because gliosis and plaque density are unchanged by SAM treatment, SAM intervention was still effective even after plaque accumulation. As such, there is potential for synergy with pharmacological treatments that suppress gliosis and/or target Aβ or TAU. Future work should explore the molecular details of C1Q synaptic recruitment, the mechanisms of synaptic engulfment, and the therapeutic development of the SAM compound.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of an mGluR5 SAM (BMS-984923) to restore synaptic density and the underlying molecular mechanisms. For nonclinical pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and toxicology experiments, multiple cell lines and animal models were used ( Supplementary Materials ). To assess synaptic density, rescue, and its mechanisms, we treated amyloidogenic AD mice and subjected them to PET imaging and behavioral assays; after sacrifice, tissue was used for immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, and snRNA-seq.
