Pathogenic tau–induced transposable element–derived dsRNA drives neuroinflammation

# Abstract
Deposition of tau protein aggregates in the brain of affected individuals is a defining feature of “tauopathies,” including Alzheimer’s disease. Studies of human brain tissue and various model systems of tauopathy report that toxic forms of tau negatively affect nuclear and genomic architecture, identifying pathogenic tau–induced heterochromatin decondensation and consequent retrotransposon activation as a causal mediator of neurodegeneration. On the basis of their similarity to retroviruses, retrotransposons drive neuroinflammation via toxic intermediates, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We find that dsRNA and dsRNA sensing machinery are elevated in astrocytes of postmortem brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy and in brains of tau transgenic mice. Using a Drosophila model of tauopathy, we identify specific tau-induced retrotransposons that form dsRNA and find that pathogenic tau and heterochromatin decondensation causally drive dsRNA-mediated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Our study suggests that pathogenic tau–induced heterochromatin decondensation and retrotransposon activation cause elevation of inflammatory, transposable element–derived dsRNA in the adult brain.

## INTRODUCTION
Retrotransposons account for 35% of the human genome ( 1 ). Fully intact, autonomous retrotransposons mobilize within a host genome via a “copy-and-paste” mechanism involving transcription of retrotransposon DNA, translation of the nascent retrotransposon RNA transcript into proteins, reverse transcription of retrotransposon RNA into DNA using retrotransposon-encoded proteins, and subsequent insertion of the new retrotransposon DNA into a new location in the genome [ Fig. 1A , example of a long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon]. In addition to the mutagenic potential of a mobilization-competent retrotransposon, retrotransposon-induced toxicity can also arise from (i) retrotransposon RNA, (ii) retrotransposon-encoded protein, (iii) retrotransposon-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), (iv) episomal retrotransposon complementary DNA (cDNA), and (v) DNA damage from failed genomic retrotransposon integration events ( Fig. 1B ) ( 2 , 3 ).

( A ) Retrotransposons mobilize via a copy-and-paste mechanism, where activation of retrotransposons within genomic DNA involves transcription of retrotransposon RNA, reverse transcription into cDNA, and insertion into a new location within the genome. Depending on the subclass of retrotransposon, the element may encode for proteins needed to facilitate the copy-and-paste mechanism, such as capsid, protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, and envelope proteins ( 2 ). ( B ) While retrotransposition can create novel insertions, toxicity can also result from (i) retrotransposon RNA, (ii) retrotransposon proteins, (iii) dsRNA generated from nascent retrotransposon transcripts, (iv) episomal retrotransposon DNA, and (v) DNA double-strand breaks from failed retrotransposon insertions.

Multiple recent studies suggest that retrotransposons are activated in the context of tau-mediated neurotoxicity and are a causal factor driving neurodegeneration ( 4 – 7 ). Retrotransposons that are elevated at the RNA level have been identified in Drosophila , mouse, and human tauopathy ( 4 – 7 ). Retrotransposon-encoded proteins and increased retrotransposon DNA copy number are also elevated in brains of tau transgenic mice ( 5 ), indicating that retrotransposon RNA is translated and that retrotransposon RNA is actively reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Studies in tau transgenic Drosophila report an increase in somatic neuronal retrotransposition events, a process that is amenable to pharmacological intervention via a reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( 6 ). Mechanistically, pathogenic forms of tau disrupt transcriptional (heterochromatin-mediated) and posttranscriptional [piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)–mediated] retrotransposon silencing ( 6 ). While retrotransposons are known to drive inflammation in other human disorders ( 1 , 8 – 11 ) and studies in the tauopathy field clearly suggest that pathogenic forms of tau activate retrotransposons across model systems, it is currently unknown whether tau-induced retrotransposon activation contributes to neuroinflammation.

In the current study, we sought to determine whether retrotransposon-derived dsRNA is elevated in tauopathy, whether elevation of dsRNA results from failed heterochromatin and/or piRNA-mediated silencing, and whether retrotransposon activation drives neuroinflammation. We find that dsRNA and dsRNA sensing machinery are significantly elevated in astrocytes of postmortem human brain tissue from human patients with Alzheimer’s disease or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a “primary” tauopathy, and in brains of rTg4510 tau transgenic mice. Similarly, we find that dsRNA accumulates in astrocyte-like glia of tau transgenic Drosophila . We further leverage the Drosophila system to identify specific retrotransposons that form dsRNA in the context of tauopathy, to establish that dsRNA causally drives neurodegeneration and activation of an innate immune response, and to discover that deficits in heterochromatin-mediated retrotransposon silencing are sufficient to elevate overall levels of dsRNA and activate the innate immune response.

## RESULTS
Initial, intermediate, and late phases of Alzheimer’s disease are neuropathologically defined via Braak staging, which is based on the degree of neurofibrillary tau pathology in specific areas of the brain ( 12 ). As we have previously identified retrotransposons that are elevated in postmortem human Alzheimer’s disease brain ( 6 ) and retrotransposons are known to form dsRNA in other human disorders ( 8 ), we first determined whether the presence of dsRNA correlates with the degree of pathogenic tau burden in the human brain. To quantify the overall dsRNA levels in human brain tissue at Braak stages 0, II/III and V/VI, we used an antibody (J2) that recognizes dsRNA of 40 nucleotides or longer in a non–sequence-specific manner ( 13 ). To determine whether dsRNA enrichment occurs in a primary tauopathy, we also performed J2 staining in postmortem brains of patients with PSP (table S1). We detect a significant increase in overall levels of dsRNA in brains harboring pathogenic forms of tau compared to controls ( Fig. 2, A and B ). Among tau-affected brains, we noticed a pattern of J2 enrichment that appeared to be astrocytic. Costaining of brains with antibodies detecting astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and dsRNA reveals significant enrichment of dsRNA in astrocytes of brains affected by tauopathy ( Fig. 2, C and D ). Additional costaining of brains with the neuron-specific antibody microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) revealed no significant enrichment of dsRNA in neurons of tau-affected brains (fig. S1, A and B). While costaining human brain tissue with antibodies detecting J2 and the microglia-specific antibody ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) revealed the presence of dsRNA in some microglia, quantification of these data indicated an overall lack of dsRNA enrichment in microglia of tau-affected brains compared to control, except in the case of late-stage human Alzheimer’s disease (fig. S1, C and D).

Human cases are described in table S1.

As dsRNA are a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern sufficient to induce an interferon response, we next determined whether melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5) is elevated in tau-affected human brains. MDA5 is a dsRNA helicase in the retinoic acid–inducible gene I–like (RIG-I) receptor family that detects long dsRNA via its DEAD box domain as part of the antiviral innate immune response ( 14 , 15 ). Costaining of postmortem human brain with antibodies detecting MDA5 and GFAP reveals a significant elevation of MDA5 in astrocytes of tau-affected brains ( Fig. 2, E and F ). Together, these findings point toward an astrocytic increase in dsRNA and dsRNA surveillance machinery in the context of primary and secondary tauopathy.

Having found that dsRNA is elevated in human tauopathy, we next investigated dsRNA accumulation in brains of tau transgenic mice. The rTg4510 mouse model features overexpression of a disease-associated ( 16 ) mutant form of human tau, tau P301L , under control of the Camk2a promoter ( 17 , 18 ). rTg4510 mice recapitulate aspects of human tauopathy including but not limited to gliosis, neuronal loss, tau tangle formation, and transposable element activation ( 17 – 20 ). Using J2-based immunofluorescence, we find a significant elevation of dsRNA in the frontal cortex of tau transgenic mice compared to controls at 6 months of age ( Fig. 3, A and B ). On the basis of our finding that dsRNA is particularly enriched in astrocytes in human tauopathy, we analyzed dsRNA burden in astrocytes of tau transgenic mice by costaining brains with antibodies detecting dsRNA and astrocytes. Similar to our analyses in human tauopathy, we find a significant increase of dsRNA in astrocytes ( Fig. 3, C to E ) but not microglia (fig. S2, A to C) or neurons (fig. S2, D and E) in brains of tau transgenic mice aged 6 months compared to control. Having also found increased levels of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 in astrocytes of human tauopathy, we analyzed astrocytic MDA5 in tau transgenic mice. Again, we find a significant elevation of MDA5 in astrocytes of tau transgenic mice aged 6 months ( Fig. 3, F to H ). Similarly, we detect a significant elevation of overall levels of dsRNA and astrocytic dsRNA in brains of rTg4510 aged 12 months (fig. S3, A to C), along with significantly elevated levels of total MDA5 and astrocytic MDA5 (fig. S3, D to F).

As gliosis begins as early as 2 months in the rTg4510 model ( 19 – 21 ), we extended our analyses of dsRNA and dsRNA sensing machinery to control and rTg4510 mice aged 2 months. While 2-month-old rTg4510 mice do not have significantly elevated levels of dsRNA or astrocytic dsRNA compared to controls (fig. S4, A to C), we detect significant elevation of MDA5 in astrocytes of rTg4510 mice at 2 months (fig. S4, D to F). Similar to our findings in human tauopathy, overall levels of dsRNA are unchanged in microglia (fig. S4, G to I) or neurons (fig. S4, J and K) of rTg4510 mice compared to control at 2 months of age. Together, these data indicate that the presence of pathogenic tau is sufficient to drive elevation of dsRNA and dsRNA sensing machinery in the mouse brain in an age-dependent manner. In addition, these data suggest that the astrocytic elevation of dsRNA and MDA5 detected in human Alzheimer’s disease and PSP is a consequence of pathogenic tau.

To investigate mechanistic links among tau, retrotransposons, dsRNA, and neurodegeneration, we turned to a well-described Drosophila model of tauopathy ( 22 , 23 ). This model is based on pan-neuronal transgenic expression of human tau harboring the human disease-associated ( 16 ) R406W mutation, tau R406W (hereafter referred to as “tau transgenic Drosophila ”) ( 22 ). We first determined whether elevation of dsRNA observed in human and mouse tauopathy is conserved in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila. We used flies at day 10 of adulthood, an age at which a moderate level of neurodegeneration can be detected in this model but before exponential decline in survivorship ( 22 , 24 ). To quantify overall levels of dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila , we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-dsRNA antibodies J2 and K2. The K2 antibody is a mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM) counterpart to J2 that also detects dsRNA species of 40 nucleotides or greater ( 13 ). ELISA-based quantification of dsRNA reveals a significant increase in total head lysates of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to controls ( Fig. 4A ). Similarly, we observe overall higher levels of dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to control based on J2 immunofluorescence ( Fig. 4, B and C ).

To determine the cell types harboring dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila , we costained control and tau transgenic Drosophila brains with antibodies detecting either elav (neurons) or repo (glia) and dsRNA. While we detect dsRNA in elav-positive neurons ( Fig. 4D ) and in repo-positive glia ( Fig. 4E ) of tau transgenic brains, presence of dsRNA in glia appeared to be more abundant than in neurons. Drosophila harbor several types of glia, including but not limited to ensheathing glia, cortex glia, and astrocyte-like glia ( 25 , 26 ), all of which express repo. Drosophila astrocyte-like glia are similar to mouse and human astrocytes in that they provide trophic support to neurons ( 25 , 27 ). In Drosophila , astrocyte-like glia can be differentiated from other types of glia by their distinct morphology ( 25 , 28 , 29 ). On the basis of morphological analysis of repo-positive cells, we find that dsRNA is enriched in astrocyte-like glia of tau transgenic Drosophila ( Fig. 4F ). As the elav protein is restricted to the nucleus, while dsRNA is predominantly cytoplasmic and thus cannot be confidently assigned to a particular nucleus, we did not quantify overall levels of neuronal dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila .

Having found an increase of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 in both human and mouse tau-affected brains, we next determined whether increasing the detection and clearance of dsRNA ameliorates dsRNA elevation and neurotoxicity in tau transgenic Drosophila . While vertebrate systems have several mechanisms of dsRNA detection and clearance, the recognition and clearance of long dsRNA is completed by Dicer-2 in Drosophila ( 30 ). Dicer-2 is a dsRNA-specific endonuclease of the ribonuclease (RNase) III family that cleaves long dsRNA into smaller fragments during RNA interference (RNAi), particularly in the context of viral infection. While Drosophila Dicer-2 is not a direct homolog of human MDA5 , both are equipped with DEAD box helicase function ( 31 ). On the basis of the conserved dsRNA detection and helicase activity between MDA5 and Dicer-2, we determined whether pan-neuronal overexpression of Dicer-2 was sufficient to decrease dsRNA levels in tau transgenic Drosophila. We find that pan-neuronal expression of Dicer-2 significantly decreases dsRNA levels in tau transgenic Drosophila compared to tau expressed alone ( Fig. 4G ). In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) reveals that overexpression of Dicer-2 is sufficient to reduce neurodegeneration in tau transgenic Drosophila ( Fig. 4H ), suggesting that the tau-induced increase in dsRNA causally mediates neurotoxicity. Together, these data indicate that pathogenic forms of tau cause an elevation of dsRNA in astrocytes of human, mouse, and Drosophila tauopathy and that dsRNA elevation occurs in the context of toxic forms of wild-type tau (Alzheimer’s disease and PSP) and from mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT ) gene that cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [rTg4510 mice ( P301L ) and tau transgenic Drosophila ( R406W )].

We have previously identified retrotransposon transcripts that are elevated in tau transgenic Drosophila and have developed and validated a custom NanoString code set consisting of probes that recognize these elements ( 6 ). Having found that dsRNA elevation is conserved among human, mouse, and fly tauopathy, we next leveraged the Drosophila system to identify retrotransposons that form dsRNA species. We first immunoprecipitated dsRNA from heads of control and tau transgenic Drosophila using the J2 antibody and confirmed the specificity of the J2 antibody for dsRNA via immunoprecipitation with a mouse IgG2A isotype control (fig. S5A). We then quantified retrotransposon transcripts in J2-immunoprecipitated dsRNA relative to total RNA (input) using our custom NanoString retrotransposon code set. We detect an overall trend toward increased retrotransposon-derived dsRNA in tau transgenic Drosophila , with a modest but statistically significant increase in 1731{}2219 and Het-A{}6270 , alongside a robust elevation of Tabor{}77 ( Fig. 5, A and B , and fig. S5B). Together, these data support a model in which pathogenic tau induces formation of retrotransposon-derived dsRNA.

A positive log 2 fold change ( x axis) indicates increased dsRNA formation of that retrotransposon in tau transgenic Drosophila .

Code set probe sequences are included in table S2. * P < 0.05, multiple unpaired two-sample t test with Welch correction.

Having found that dsRNA causally mediate neurodegeneration and identified retrotransposons that form dsRNA in tau transgenic Drosophila , we next investigated cellular mechanisms that might underlie tau-induced dsRNA formation. We have previously reported that pan-neuronal expression of human tau in Drosophila disrupts two arms of transposable element control: heterochromatin-mediated silencing of retrotransposon transcription and piRNA-mediated posttranscriptional degradation of retrotransposon RNA ( 6 ). Genetic rescue of tau-induced deficits in heterochromatin silencing and piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing decrease retrotransposon transcript levels and suppress tau-induced neurotoxicity ( 6 , 24 ).

To determine whether heterochromatin decondensation is sufficient to elevate dsRNA in the adult Drosophila brain, we quantified dsRNA in heads of Drosophila with pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated depletion of Su(var)205 or Su(var)3-9 . Su(var)205 encodes heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) ( 32 ), while Su(var)3-9 encodes a histone methyltransferase responsible for adding silencing methyl groups to lysine-9 of histone-3 ( 33 ). J2/K2 ELISA indicates that pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated depletion of these heterochromatin regulators is sufficient to elevate dsRNA in the fly brain ( Fig. 6, A and B ). We additionally quantified dsRNA in heads of Drosophila with pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated depletion of rhino , a fly ortholog of HP1 ( 34 , 35 ). As rhino is most well known for its role in the germ line, we first confirmed that rhino RNA could be detected in total brain lysates and that pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated knockdown of rhino significantly depletes rhino transcript levels (fig. S6A). Again, J2/K2 ELISA indicates that pan-neuronal knockdown of rhino is sufficient to elevate dsRNA in total head lysates ( Fig. 6C ). Similar to previous studies in which pan-neuronal knockdown of Su(var)205 or Su(var)3-9 is sufficient to drive neurodegeneration ( 6 ), we find that pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated reduction of rhino is sufficient to drive neurodegeneration in the adult Drosophila brain based on TUNEL (fig. S6B).

All experiments were performed in heads of 10-day-old adult flies; n = 20 biological replicates, each biological replicate is a pool of three female and three male heads. n.s., not significant; * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01, unpaired t test.

We next quantified dsRNA in heads of Drosophila with genetic disruption of factors that are critical for piRNA biogenesis. We find that pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated reduction of piwi or aubergine ( aub ) is insufficient to significantly elevate dsRNA in the adult Drosophila brain ( Fig. 6, D and E ). Drosophila carrying a loss-of-function mutation in Argonaute 3 ( AGO3 ), however, has significantly elevated levels of dsRNA ( Fig. 6F ). Together, these data suggest that loss of heterochromatin-mediated silencing is causal for increased dsRNA production and that loss of piRNA-mediated posttranscriptional retrotransposon silencing likely plays a more minor role in dsRNA regulation.

On the basis of mechanistic links between dsRNA and the innate immune response in other human disorders ( 36 , 37 ), we next determined whether dsRNA formation is a causal factor driving neuroinflammation. We designed a custom NanoString code set consisting of probes that detect an array of RNAs related to the three major immune responses in Drosophila including the Toll, immune deficiency (IMD), and Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways as well as three genes associated with RNAi ( Fig. 7A and tables S3 and S4). When compared to control, we find that pan-neuronal expression of mutant human tau elevates transcripts of innate immune genes across the Toll, IMD, and Jak/Stat pathways ( Fig. 7B ). In all three pathways, we observe a trend toward increased antimicrobial peptide expression, an indicator of persistent immune activation. In addition, we find elevated transcript levels of the Jak/STAT ligand upd1 and decreased transcript levels of transcription factor Stat92E. Furthermore, we also find that transcripts of the Jak/STAT-regulated gene vir-1 are elevated in tau transgenic Drosophila , indicating activation of the Jak/STAT response. In the RNAi-mediated response to viral nucleic acids in Drosophila , AGO2 loads small dsRNA species onto the RNA-induced silencing complex immediately following Dicer-2–dependent degradation of long dsRNA ( 38 ). We find that transcript levels of AGO2 are significantly decreased in tau transgenic flies compared to control, suggesting a dysfunctional response to dsRNA. On the basis of our discovery that overexpression of Dicer-2 is sufficient to reduce dsRNA levels and decrease tau-induced neurotoxicity, we quantified changes to tau-induced neuroinflammation in tau transgenic flies pan-neuronally overexpressing Dicer-2 . Among significant reduction of various other transcripts associated with innate immune activation ( Fig. 7C ), tau transgenic Drosophila overexpressing Dicer-2 have reduced transcript levels of the Toll pathway receptor Toll , the IMD pathway gene Fadd , and the Jak/STAT-regulated gene vir-1 , suggesting that tau-induced formation of dsRNA is a causal factor driving innate immune activation in the Drosophila brain.

With the knowledge that tau drives heterochromatin decondensation in the Drosophila brain and that pan-neuronal heterochromatin decondensation activates transposable elements ( 6 ) and elevates dsRNA, we next determined whether similar inflammatory changes result from pan-neuronal heterochromatin decondensation. We find that pan-neuronal RNAi-mediated depletion of Su(var)205 is sufficient to increase activation of the three major immune pathways ( Fig. 7D ). Su(var)205 RNAi increases transcript levels of Toll- and IMD-related antimicrobial peptides, as well as hop (the Drosophila homolog of human Jak) and Stat92E , suggesting that the Jak/STAT pathway is activated in response to heterochromatin decondensation in the brain. To further investigate the consequences of heterochromatin decondensation on neuroinflammation, we analyzed the immune response profile of flies with RNAi-mediated depletion of Su(var)3-9 or rhino . We detect significant elevation of transcripts in the Toll, IMD, and Jak/STAT pathways, similar to tau transgenic Drosophila ( Fig. 7, E and F ). Overall, these data provide compelling evidence that the adult Drosophila brain mounts an innate immune response as a consequence of genetic manipulations that elevate dsRNA.

## DISCUSSION
Retrotransposon activation is a consequence of physiological aging and pathogenic tau and causally contributes to neurotoxicity ( 4 – 7 , 9 , 38 , 39 ). In addition, retrotransposons and other repetitive elements are known to form immunogenic dsRNA in various human disorders ( 8 , 40 , 41 ). In the current study, we link pathogenic tau–induced retrotransposon activation to dsRNA formation by investigating the extent of dsRNA elevation across multiple models of tauopathy as well as the source and mechanism of dsRNA production and consequent neuroinflammation.

We detect significant dsRNA accumulation in postmortem brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease and PSP and in brains of mouse and Drosophila models of tauopathy. These findings are consistent with previous reports that cellular detectors of dsRNA such as protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) are elevated in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease ( 42 – 45 ). While dsRNA has never before been analyzed in the context of tauopathy, recent bioinformatic analyses of microglial transcriptomic changes in human Alzheimer’s disease, FTD, PSP, and rTg4510 mice propose a model in which tau-induced changes in chromatin structure cause activation of dsRNA receptors to trigger a microglial type I interferon response ( 46 ). Our finding that dsRNA and MDA5 are elevated in tau-affected brains and that reduction of dsRNA suppresses tau-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila supports a causal link between dsRNA and an innate immune response but points toward astrocytes as a mediator of this effect. It appears that increased dsRNA production is an early event in the course of tau-induced toxicity, as dsRNA is significantly elevated in brains of patients at Braak stage II/III compared to Braak 0, as early as 6 months in brains of rTg4510 tau transgenic mice, and before the exponential decline in survivorship of tau transgenic Drosophila . While dsRNA are highly stable RNA species ( 40 ), we acknowledge that use of postmortem human tissue may present variability due to differences in tissue collection and storage. Our use of a multisystem approach, however, decreases the inherent limitations of any one model system.

Our analyses of tau-affected human, mouse, and Drosophila brains reveal significant deposition of dsRNA in astrocytes. Astrocytes provide metabolic support for neurons, regulate neurotransmitters, and maintain blood-brain barrier integrity ( 47 ). In physiological aging and disease, astrocytes respond to injury and dyshomeostasis of the neuronal environment, a process known as “gliosis” ( 48 , 49 ). In tauopathies, astrocytes play a key role in responding to pathogenic tau and neurotoxicity ( 47 , 50 ), and transplantation of isogenic control astrocytes into brains of hTau.P301S mice prevents tau-induced neuronal death ( 51 ). While Drosophila do not have bona fide astrocytes, astrocyte-like glial cells provide similar trophic support to neurons as astrocytes do in vertebrates ( 25 ). Cultured human astrocytes treated with a dsRNA mimetic up-regulate the dsRNA receptor Toll-like receptor 3 ( 52 ), indicating that astrocytes respond to extracellular dsRNA. While the astrocytic accumulation of dsRNA in tauopathy suggests that this glial type produces, sequesters, or fails to properly degrade dsRNA in the context of tau pathogenicity, our finding that overexpression of Dicer-2 in neurons of tau transgenic Drosophila is sufficient to reduce overall levels of dsRNA supports a model in which retrotransposon transcripts form dsRNA in neurons harboring pathogenic forms of tau and that resulting dsRNA is secreted from neurons and taken up by astrocytes.

Leveraging the fly system, we find that members of the 1731 , Het-A , and Tabor subfamilies of retrotransposons form dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila . 1731 and Tabor belong to the LTR subclass of retrotransposons ( 53 ). Het-A is a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)–like non-LTR retrotransposon involved in Drosophila telomere maintenance ( 54 ). While we have previously identified LTR and LINE elements with increased transcript levels in mouse ( 5 ) and human tauopathy ( 6 ), we do not currently know whether these elements form dsRNA in the context of vertebrate tauopathy. Although our NanoString-based approach to identify dsRNA-forming retrotransposons in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila was effective, we acknowledge that this approach is biased toward identifying dsRNA-forming retrotransposon transcripts already known to be overexpressed in tau transgenic Drosophila. Furthermore, because our NanoString analyses use a total brain lysate from Drosophila heads and because astrocyte-like glia make up a small fraction of cells within the Drosophila brain, this approach is likely an underestimation of the magnitude of changes in dsRNA-forming retrotransposon transcripts in astrocyte-like glia of tau transgenic Drosophila . In addition, while we have identified retrotransposons that form dsRNA in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila , there are a variety of additional endogenous sources of intracellular dsRNA ( 55 ) that could contribute to the burden of dsRNA in tauopathy. In future studies in vertebrates, we recommend a more agnostic approach in which dsRNA are isolated from brain tissue via J2 immunoprecipitation and then subject to RNA sequencing.

Mechanistically, we find that RNAi-mediated depletion of heterochromatin regulators impacts dsRNA formation in the Drosophila brain. These findings are consistent with previous studies in which tau-induced heterochromatin decondensation drives retrotransposon transcription ( 5 , 6 ) and work in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrating that global loss of HP1 is sufficient to elevate dsRNA ( 56 ). Our findings also align with studies of C9ORF72 expansion in which alterations in H3K9 posttranslational modifications deplete HP1α and drive repetitive element transcription and dsRNA formation ( 57 ). Our findings are consistent with a model in which tau-induced, retrotransposon-derived dsRNA drive neuroinflammation. We find that genetic overexpression of Dicer-2 ameliorates dsRNA elevation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila . Development of new approaches to elevate or deplete transposable element-derived dsRNA would greatly facilitate our ability to assess dsRNA as a therapeutic and anti-inflammatory target in a variety of human disorders that involve dsRNA production.

Our investigation into the effects of heterochromatin decondensation on dsRNA formation included RNAi-mediated depletion of rhino, a protein involved in heterochromatin maintenance that has been extensively characterized in the Drosophila germ line ( 34 , 58 ). We did not expect to detect such substantial effects of rhino depletion on dsRNA formation, neurotoxicity, and neuroinflammation, as this factor is expressed at low levels in the adult Drosophila brain. Our findings were nevertheless highly significant and consistent with consequences of genetic manipulation of Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-9 . To genetically disrupt piRNA-mediated transposon silencing, we reduced overall levels of piwi or aub in neurons via RNAi and also introduced a loss-of-function mutation in AGO3 . While neuronal knockdown of piwi and aub did not elevate dsRNA in the Drosophila brain, we do detect significant elevation of dsRNA in the context of AGO3 loss of function. We acknowledge that there is cross-talk between heterochromatin regulators and piRNA biogenesis factors that may underlie the effects of AGO3 loss of function on dsRNA production. For example, studies in the Drosophila germ line report a direct interaction between HP1 and piwi ( 59 ) and also report that mutations in rhino are sufficient to deplete piRNAs originating from dual-strand piRNA clusters ( 34 ). In general, we find that the effects of dysfunctional piRNA control on dsRNA formation are less profound than loss of heterochromatin-mediated silencing. While it remains to be tested, we speculate that piRNAs cannot recognize and bind to these transcripts because of the double-stranded nature of dsRNA.

We find that both pathogenic tau– and RNAi-mediated heterochromatin decondensation are sufficient to drive neuroinflammation in Drosophila , with shared induction of the Toll, IMD, and Jak/STAT pathways. An accumulating set of data suggest that retrotransposon activation is consistently immunogenic in a variety of human disorders, a process initiated by the detection of retrotransposon-derived nucleic acids via dsRNA-sensing machinery RIG-I/MDA5, PKR, and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) ( 1 , 8 – 11 , 60 ). In models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia, decondensation of LINE elements triggers RIG-I–mediated immune responses ( 8 , 11 , 61 ). Alu - and LINE -derived dsRNA initiate innate immune responses in models of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) ( 10 ) and multiple sclerosis ( 14 , 37 ). In patients with AGS, mutations in ADAR result in elevated type I interferon response ( 11 ), suggesting that deficits in dsRNA editing by ADAR drive inflammation. Similarly, studies in C9ORF2 ALS-FTD brain find that C9ORF72 -derived dsRNA accumulates in the cytoplasm of neurons, activates interferon signaling, and mediates cell-autonomous and nonautonomous neuronal death ( 40 ). In addition, depletion of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) increases levels of repetitive elements and dsRNA and elevates proinflammatory gene expression-associated dsRNA surveillance proteins ( 41 , 56 , 57 , 61 , 62 ). These previous reports are consistent with our finding that neuroinflammation in the Drosophila brain is in part due to the elevation of dsRNA and support our finding that MDA5-dependent dsRNA surveillance is elevated as a consequence of pathogenic tau accumulation. In the context of recent reports that retrotransposon activation is a feature of pathogenic tau and physiological brain aging ( 1 , 4 – 7 , 9 ), our findings provide the first evidence, suggesting that neuroinflammatory dsRNA elevation mediated by retrotransposon activation is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common human neurodegenerative disorder, and PSP, a primary tauopathy.

## METHODS
Human postmortem brain tissue was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank (Jacksonville, FL). Deidentified patient information can be found in table S1.

rTg4510 and nontransgenic control mice (mixed 129S6, FVB genetic background) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (IMSR_JAX:024854). Controls harbor the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) element but lack transgenic human MAPT P301L . Female mice were group-housed in a pathogen-free mouse facility on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Following anesthesia with 2% isoflurane, cardiac perfusion was performed with 2× PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All experimental procedures in mice were performed according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

All Drosophila melanogaster crosses, stocks, and aging were maintained at 25°C on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with males and females housed in the same vial. Fresh standard diet (Bloomington formulation) was provided every 4 days. Full Drosophila genotypes are listed in table S5. All constructs were driven pan-neuronally in Drosophila using the galactose-responsive transcription factor (GAL4)/upstream activating sequence (UAS) system with the elav promoter driving GAL4 expression. Su(var)205 RNAi , rhi RNAi , Su(var)3-9 RNAi , and aub RNAi ( 63 ) were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center ( www.vdrc.at ). The AGO3 LOF and UAS-Dcr-2 stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537).

For immunofluorescence analyses of postmortem human brain, 10-μm frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min and ultraviolet photobleached for 4.5 hours at 4°C. Sections were blocked with 2% milk in PBS plus 0.2% Triton‐X 100 (PBS Tr ) for 30 min and incubated with J2 (Scicons/Exalpha Biologicals) and GFAP (Abcam), MAP2 (Millipore), or Iba1 (Wako) antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. After two washes in PBS Tr and one in PBS, sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature in blocking solution. For detection of MDA5 in GFAP-positive astrocytes, sections were incubated with anti-MDA5 (Abcam) and anti-GFAP (Abcam), followed with goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated antibodies. All incubations were performed in a humidified chamber.

Immunofluorescence in mouse tissues was performed on coronal control and rTg4510 mouse MultiBrain sections that were cryoprotected, embedded in a solid matrix, and sectioned at a thickness of 35 μm by Neuroscience Associates Inc. (Knoxville, TN). Following removal from storage and three washes in PBS, floating sections were incubated with J2 and GFAP, MAP2, or Iba1 antibodies overnight at 4°C in a blocking solution of 2% normal goat serum in 1× PBS Tr . After three washes in PBS Tr , sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antibodies in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. For detection of MDA5 in GFAP-positive astrocytes, sections were incubated with MDA5 and GFAP antibodies, followed with goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated antibodies. Sections were mounted to slides and a coverslip was set with Fluoromount G + DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).

For immunofluorescence in flies, Drosophila were anesthetized, and whole brains were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min. After blocking with 2% BSA in PBS Tr for 30 min, brains were incubated with J2 anti-dsRNA antibody diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer overnight. After washing twice in PBS Tr and once in PBS, brains were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 for 2 hours at room temperature. Brains were washed once again as above, and coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G + DAPI (SouthernBiotech). All incubations were completed in a humidifying chamber. For colocalization experiments, after initial secondary incubation, brains were blocked with 10% normal goat serum diluted in PBS Tr . The primary incubation in blocking buffer was repeated for elav and repo with Alex4 Fluor 88– and Alex Fluor 555–conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. All Drosophila , mouse, and human tissue samples were visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss 880, Zeiss 780, and Zeiss 710). Image analysis was completed for all immunofluorescence samples using Fiji (NIH). All antibodies and concentrations are listed in table S6.

ELISA was used to detect dsRNA levels as modified from ( 13 , 64 – 66 ). A 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4°C with 1 μg/μl concentration of the anti-dsRNA antibody J2. The next day, the ELISA plate was washed with wash buffer (1× PBS with 0.5% Tween 20) three times. Following RNA isolation by TRIzol, total RNA of biological replicates of six pooled samples (three males and three females) were loaded in triplicate on the J2-coated ELISA plate and incubated overnight at 4°C. Poly polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) was used as a standard in each run and loaded in duplicate from a range of 0 to 100 ng/μl. Samples were removed after incubation, and the plate was washed three times with wash buffer. The K2 anti-dsRNA antibody (Scicons/Exalpha Biologicals) was then added to the ELISA plate at a 1:4 dilution and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Following three washes with wash buffer, anti-mouse IgM antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (EMD Millipore) was added at a dilution of 1:5000 and incubated for 1 hour. The ELISA plate was washed four times with 1× tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20, and samples were developed with 100 μg of p -nitrophenylphosphate (EMD Millipore).

TUNEL-positive neurons in Drosophila brains were quantified with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase FragEL kit for TUNEL staining (Calbiochem). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Drosophila heads were sectioned at 4 μm, and staining was completed according to the manufacturer protocol. Secondary detection of biotin-labeled deoxynucleotides at exposed ends of DNA fragments was completed with diaminobenzidine. Bright-field microscopy was used to count TUNEL-positive neurons throughout the entire fly brain.

To quantify rhino RNA transcripts, six biological samples (six Drosophila heads per sample) were homogenized in TRIzol for RNA extraction (Invitrogen). Total RNA concentrations were quantified on a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed (cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems). cDNA was mixed with a rhino -specific TaqMan gene expression assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), loaded on to a digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) chip, sealed, and amplified. Amplified chips were read and analyzed on the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR system, and the absolute concentration in copies per microliter was determined. The TaqMan gene expression primer and probe for rhino was predesigned by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

RNA was isolated from six pooled heads per genotype, composed of three males and three females, with TRIzol extraction. Total isolated RNA was then used for ELISA and immune gene expression NanoString experiments. For NanoString-based analysis of dsRNA identity, immunoprecipitation of dsRNA was performed on the basis of previously described protocols ( 41 , 66 , 67 ). Briefly, 10 fly heads per sample were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM tris-HCL, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 1.5 mM MgCl, 140 nM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) with 1 μg of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and precleared with 40 μl of protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. After bead clearance, precleared lysate was split in two and diluted to a volume of 200 μl with cold binding buffer (0.0025% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS). Precleared lysate (200 μl) was stored at −80°C for “input.” A 1 μg of J2 anti-dsRNA antibody was added to precleared lysate and incubated at 4°C overnight. After incubation with J2, 50 μl of prewashed protein A Dynabeads were added and incubated for 4 hours at 4°C. Following incubation, the incubated lysate was removed, and beads were washed with cold binding buffer five times. Isolated dsRNA bound to beads and total RNA from input were extracted with TRIzol. All concentrations were measured by Qubit. To ensure that the anti-dsRNA antibody was specific to dsRNA isolation, an antibody control was first performed using mouse IgG2A (Sigma-Aldrich).

For NanoString-based analysis of dsRNA identity, the custom retrotransposon code set was based on a slightly modified version of a previous code set developed for the detection of tau-induced retrotransposons ( 6 ). The retrotransposon code set consists of three internal control genes and 25 probes. A full description of the retrotransposon code set can be found in table S2. Input RNA and dsRNA (50 ng) isolated by J2 immunoprecipitation were hybridized to the retrotransposon code set. For NanoString-based analysis of immune gene expression, the custom immune response code set was designed on the basis of previously identified innate immune genes differentially expressed in tau transgenic Drosophila from two independently generated total RNA sequencing datasets ( 6 , 68 ). The immune response code set consists of probes for 50 innate immune genes, covering all isoforms transcribed and four internal control genes. A full description of the immune response code set can be found in table S4. Following RNA isolation with TRIzol, 10 ng of total RNA was hybridized to the code set as described in the NanoString nCounter XT CodeSet Gene Expression Assay manual. All assays and samples were analyzed following code set hybridization on the SPRINT Digital Analyzer, and normalization was completed using nSolver4 software (NanoString Technologies Inc.).

For all pairwise comparisons, Student’s t test was used, with Welsh correction for SD where applicable. When performing multiple comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test was applied. For NanoString-based analysis of retrotransposon dsRNA, dsRNA and input counts were normalized to the geometric mean of all retrotransposon transcripts across samples, and dsRNA for each retrotransposon were normalized to input for each sample. In all NanoString analyses, a multiple unpaired two-sample t test with Welch correction was used. For all statistical tests, a confidence interval of 95% was assumed. G*Power software was used for determining sample size in the dsRNA ELISA. All analyses were performed using Prism8 software (GraphPad). Samples were randomized, and investigators were blinded to genotype in all immunofluorescence when possible.
