Heat shock chaperone HSPB1 regulates cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation and liquid-to-gel transition

# Abstract
While acetylated, RNA binding deficient TDP-43 reversibly phase separates within nuclei into complex droplets (anisosomes) comprised of TDP-43-containing liquid outer shells and liquid centers of HSP70 family chaperones, cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are hallmarks of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Here we show that transient oxidative stress, proteasome inhibition, or inhibition of HSP70’s ATP-dependent chaperone activity provokes reversible cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing and transition from liquid to gel/solid, independent of RNA binding or stress granules. Isotope labeling mass spectrometry is used to identify that phase separated cytoplasmic TDP-43 is bound by the small heat shock protein HSPB1. Binding is direct, mediated through TDP-43’s RNA binding and low complexity domains. HSPB1 partitions into TDP-43 droplets, inhibits TDP-43 assembly into fibrils, and is essential for disassembly of stress-induced TDP-43 droplets. Decrease of HSPB1 promotes cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing and mislocalization. HSPB1 depletion is identified within ALS-patient spinal motor neurons containing aggregated TDP-43. These findings identify HSPB1 to be a regulator of cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation.

## Introduction
TDP-43, a predominantly nuclear RNA/DNA binding protein with a prion-like domain, is mis-localized to and aggregated within the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all (97%) patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 1 . It has been reported to similarly accumulate cytoplasmically in other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) 2 , 3 , Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 4 , and a newly recognized dementia found in the oldest population and named l imbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) 5 .

ALS/FTD-associated RNA binding proteins (e.g., FUS 6 , hnRNPA1 7 , and TDP-43 8 - 13 ) have been shown to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Work from us 8 and others 6 , 7 has demonstrated that TDP-43-containing, liquid-like, phase separated droplets can convert into gel/solid structures with prolonged stress, or even into amyloid-like fiber structures in vitro . Fibril-induced stress in turn can induce cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets which provoke inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport (accompanied by mislocalization of RanGap1, Ran, and Nup107), clearance of nuclear TDP-43, and cell death 8 . These findings identify a neuronal cell death mechanism that can be initiated by transient stress-induced cytosolic de-mixing of TDP-43.

In normal cells, phase separation of these RNA binding proteins appears to be tightly controlled, with a proportion of each de-mixed into a liquid droplet within nucleoplasm or cytoplasm. While post-translational acetylation can drive intranuclear phase separation into complex droplets (called anisosomes) comprised of liquid outer shells of TDP-43 and liquid centers of HSP70 family chaperones 14 , the mechanisms that mediate cytoplasmic phase separation have not yet been determined.

Some RNA binding proteins can phase separate when cells are challenged by stresses, including oxidative stress 8 or proteasome inhibition 15 , 16 . Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining proteostasis and safeguarding proteins from misfolding and aggregation 17 - 19 . In agreement with this, a variety of chaperones (e.g., HSP60, HSPB1, HSPB3, HSPB8, BAG3, and DNAJB2) have been reported to harbor pathogenic mutations in neurodegenerative diseases 20 , 21 , while expression of the HSP70 family has been reported to be transcriptionally downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease 22 . Moreover, studies using model organisms and human brain samples have proposed an age-dependent decline of proteostasis capacity, including decrease of heat shock proteins during normal aging and in different neurodegenerative diseases 22 , 23 .

Using a proximity labeling approach, our recent work has identified that nuclear RNA-binding deficient TDP-43 interacts with HSP70 family members to enable its phase separation into anisosomes which require the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of the HSP70 family for maintaining liquidity of the shells and cores 14 . Here we adopt a similar proximity labeling approach to identify that when phase separated in the cytoplasm, TDP-43 binds to the small heat shock protein HSPB1 (also known as HSP27 in human), an ATP-independent chaperone belonging to the small heat shock protein family 24 , 25 . We also determine that HSPB1 de-mixes with TDP-43 in vitro , delays the aging of TDP-43 droplets into gels, inhibits aggregation/assembly of TDP-43’s low complexity domain (LCD) into fibrils, and plays a critical role in disassembly of stressed-induced, gel/solid-like structures formed from phase separated cytoplasmic TDP-43.

## Results
Recognizing that nuclear transport declines during aging 26 , 27 and that RNA binding of TDP-43 can be modulated by its post-translational acetylation of lysines in each of its RNA binding motifs (RRMs) 14 , 28 , 29 , we tested how cytoplasmic TDP-43 (with or without ability to bind RNA) is affected by the proteomic stress accompanying age-dependent reduction in proteasome 30 , 31 or HSP70 chaperone 22 , 23 activity. Induction of RNA binding competent cytoplasmic TDP-43 ( Figure 1a ) produced concentration-dependent phase separation into many rounded droplets of varying diameters ( Figure 1b ). RNA binding incompetent TDP-43 (generated by mutating five phenylalanines to leucines to block pi-pi interactions with RNA bases 32 , 33 ) phase separated into several larger spherical particles ( Extended Data Fig. 1a , b ) when TDP-43 concentration exceeded a diffuse cytoplasmic concentration (~3 μM) ( Extended Data Fig. 1c - e ).

A lower level of initially diffusely positioned RNA binding competent TDP-43 was induced by transient reduction in proteasome activity (by addition of the inhibitor MG132) to phase separate into many small, rounded cytoplasmic particles ( Figure 1c ). Proteasome inhibition induced a proportion of RNA binding incompetent TDP-43 (TDP-43 2KQ with acetylation mimicking conversion of lysines K145 and K192 to glutamine 14 , 28 , 29 [ Figure 1c ] or TDP-43 5FL [ Extended Data Fig. 1a , f ]) to phase separate into nearly spherical, cytoplasmic droplets. Inhibition of HSP70 activity also efficiently induced de-mixing but only of RNA-binding incompetent, cytoplasmic TDP-43 ( Figure 1d , Extended Data Fig. 1f ), consistent with our prior finding that HSP70 is preferentially bound to RNA-free TDP-43 14 .

While an even stronger oxidative stress (sodium arsenite) produced robust de-mixing of multiple other RNA binding proteins (including EIF3n and UBAP2L) into polyadenylated mRNA-containing stress granules ( Extended Data Fig. 1g - i ), arsenite exposure induced phase separation of both RNA binding competent and incompetent TDP-43 ( Figure 1e , Extended Data Fig. 1g - i ) into cytoplasmic droplets that were clearly distinct from stress granules ( Extended Data Fig. 1g - i ). A close examination of the droplet size and roundedness revealed that greater than 2/3rds (69%) of TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover droplets had circularity of 0.80 or more, but this decreased to only 49% after 4 hours of arsenite exposure ( Extended Data Fig. 1j ) accompanied by an increase in droplet size ( Extended Data Fig. 1l ). A similar trend of changes was seen for the droplets formed by RNA binding deficient TDP-43 ΔNLS/2KQ-Clover ( Extended Data Fig. 1k , m ).

Use of f luorescence r ecovery a fter p hoto-bleaching (FRAP) validated that most molecules of TDP-43 (RNA binding competent or RNA binding incompetent) in cytoplasmic droplets formed by a high level of cytoplasmic TDP-43 had liquid-like character, with ~70% fluorescence recovery with a t 1/2 of 12.8 seconds ( Figure 1g , j , Extended Data Fig. 2a , d ), as we reported previously 8 . Phase separated, liquid-like TDP-43 droplets displayed viscoelastic properties that included deformation of their shapes as they moved through cytoplasm ( Supplementary Movie 1 ). While at cytoplasmic levels below the saturation concentration TDP-43 was diffusely localized, within 2 to 4 hours after addition of an applied stress [i.e., an inhibitor to reduce proteasome activity ( Figure 1h , j , Extended Data Fig. 2b , d ) or exposure to sodium arsenite ( Figure 1i , j , Extended Data Fig. 2c , d )], the apparent dynamic arrest of initially phase separated TDP-43 produced rounded, cytoplasmic gels/solids, for which there was essentially no fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and no deformation when moved through cytoplasm ( Supplementary Movie 2 ).

Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane (with digitonin) without disruption of the nuclear envelope lowered the diffuse cytoplasmic pool of TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover and provoked rapid droplet dissolution in unstressed cells, but not in after exposure to arsenite stress ( Extended Data Fig. 2e - h ). Phase separation into initially liquid TDP-43 droplets 8 upon exposure to sodium arsenite was followed by a gradual, time-dependent decrease (by 2-4 fold) in saturation concentration (i.e., diffuse TDP-43) ( Figure 1k - m , Extended Data Fig. 2i ) and correspondingly increased recruitment of TDP-43 into the rounded droplets ( Extended Data Fig. 2j ), consistent with stress-induced dynamical arrest after phase separation. Correlative light and electron microscopy confirmed that the cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets induced by arsenite contained electron dense components closely packed within a membraneless organelle ( Figure 1n ).

Additionally, in non-stressed cells, accumulation of increasing levels of TDP-43 initially produced small, rounded TDP-43 droplets that, with recruitment of additional TDP-43 coupled with occasional droplet fusion, converted into bigger, brighter, elongated droplets ( Extended Data Fig. 2k - m ). FRAP analysis revealed that the small, rounded droplets were liquid-like with rapid recovery, while the bigger, elongated ones were gel-like, with less than 10% of TDP-43 molecules within individual droplets rapidly exchanging with the diffuse pool ( Extended Data Fig. 2n ). Liquid-like and gel-like droplets were present within the same cell ( Extended Data Fig. 2i , n ). Collectively, this evidence supports phase separation-aided percolation 34 as an underlying mechanism for gelation in the absence of an acute proteotoxic stress.

We next tested if continuing cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing was sufficient to sequester nuclear TDP-43 so as to produce a nuclear TDP-43 loss of function (as is seen in surviving neurons in postmortem analyses of ALS tissues 2 , 35 ). Cells in which fluorescently tagged wild type TDP-43 replaced endogenous TDP-43 8 (mediated by the known TDP-43 auto-regulation mechanism 36 , 37 ) were cell cycle arrested in G0/G1 (by a combination of serum reduction and addition of the Cdk4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib) and then induced to express cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover ) ( Figure 2a ). Increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 drove concentration dependent formation of liquid TDP-43 droplets which sequestered a proportion of nuclear TDP-43 within 24 hours, with almost complete nuclear clearing of TDP-43 within 40 hours ( Figure 2b ). Continuous addition of a low level of sodium arsenite for a final 4 or 8 hours exacerbated depletion of nuclear TDP-43 and conversion of de-mixed cytoplasmic TDP-43 into larger gel/solid droplets ( Figure 2c , d ). At all timepoints, TDP-43 phase separation in the cytoplasm was independent of stress granule proteins (e.g., G3BP1) in the absence ( Figure 2e , g ) or presence ( Figure 2f , g ) of arsenite.

While TDP-43 without both RNA binding domains (TDP-43 ΔNLS/ΔRRM1&2-Clover ) formed round, liquid-like droplets when expressed in cytoplasm ( Extended Data Fig. 2o ) (in line with an earlier report 38 ), added stresses (e.g., proteasome inhibition or exposure to arsenite), did not induce additional droplets ( Figure 3a - b ) or liquid-to-gel conversion of cytoplasmic TDP-43 variants without both RRMs ( Figure 3c - d ). The reversible liquid character of these RRM-free TDP-43 droplets was further validated by their fast dissolution (within 1 minute) after cell membrane permeabilization with nonionic detergent digitonin. In contrast, arsenite-induced TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover droplets were highly resistant to similar cell permeabilization ( Figure 3e - h ), yielding gelled droplets that were sedimentable ( Extended Data Fig. 2p ). While after arsenite exposure full-length RNA binding deficient TDP-43 co-phase separated with RRM-deleted TDP-43, the RRM-deficient TDP-43 remained liquid-like even when the full-length protein had been dynamically arrested into a gelled state ( Figure 3k ), evidence supporting that the RNA binding domains of TDP-43 are critical for liquid-to-gel/solid transition of initially liquid TDP-43 droplets. Tests of variants missing either RRM revealed RRM1, but not RRM2, is essential for this liquid-to-gel transition ( Figure 3i - j , Extended Data Fig. 2p ).

Proximity labeling allows identification of close interactors at ~20 nm spatiotemporal resolution 39 - 42 . As we have done for nuclear TDP-43 phase separated droplets 14 , the components of de-mixed cytoplasmic TDP-43 were identified using proximity labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry. Cell lines were generated that express fluorescent, APEX2-tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover-APEX2 ) or fluorescent, cytoplasmic APEX2 (APEX2 Clover-NES ) alone. Cytoplasmic RNA binding competent TDP-43 phase separation was induced with addition of sodium arsenite or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Extended Data Fig. 3a , b ). To enable direct comparisons, proximity labeling was done in six groups: cells with diffuse cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover-APEX2 ) or cytoplasmic APEX2 (APEX2 Clover-NES ), cells with predominantly de-mixed cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover-APEX2 ) or APEX2 following exposure to sodium arsenite, and cells with partially de-mixed cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover-APEX2 ) or APEX2 after exposure to MG132 ( Figure 4a ).

Binding partners of TDP-43 in each condition were identified using six-plex t andem m ass t ag (TMT) labeling ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS3-based). Comparing the combined intensity of all peptides belonging to each protein in cells expressing TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover-APEX2 and APEX2 NES-Clover from three biological replicates (each with two technical replicates), 27 proteins were reproducibly labeled by APEX tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 under no stress conditions, 19 proteins after cell exposure to sodium arsenite, and 53 proteins after proteasome inhibition ( Figure 4b , Extended Data Fig. 3c , Source data Fig. 4 ).

While 15 proteins were both found in no stress and sodium arsenite groups (including RNA binding proteins, translation factors, and β-tubulins - Figure 4b ), arsenite-induced TDP-43 phase separation significantly increased proximity labeling more than 3-fold only for one: the small heat shock protein folding chaperone HSPB1 ( Figure 4c ). Immunostaining for endogenous HSPB1 (in U2OS cells and iPSC-derived cortical and motor neurons - Extended Data Fig. 3d - e ) and direct detection of mCherry-tagged HSPB1 ( Figure 4d ) validated that HSPB1 was recruited to and enriched in cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets. These HSPB1-positive TDP-43 droplets were independent of stress granules and their constituents ( Figure 4e ), consistent with decreased labeling of stress granule proteins TIAR and UPF1 by APEX-tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 after arsenite-induced stress granule assembly ( Figure 4c ). Use of FRAP revealed that the phase separated droplets of TDP-43 induced by sodium arsenite rapidly converted from liquid to gels in which TDP-43 did not exchange with soluble TDP-43 despite continuing dynamic exchange of half of the de-mixed HSPB1 (45% fluorescence recovery with a t 1/2 of 7.5 s) ( Figure 4f - g ).

To determine whether, and if so how, HSPB1 affected TDP-43 phase separation, we affinity purified bacterially expressed full-length maltose binding protein (MBP) tagged TDP-43 and HIS tagged HSPB1 ( Figure 5a , Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Each was then fluorescently-labeled with NHS-Alexa 488 or NHS-Alexa 555, respectively ( Figure 5b ). MBP-tagged TDP-43 or MBP tag-cleaved TDP-43 spontaneously phase separated into droplets upon addition of a crowding reagent (dextran added to 7.5% final concentration) ( Figure 5b , Extended Data Fig. 4b - c ). FRAP revealed that freshly prepared TDP-43 droplets exhibited rapid, nearly complete (80%) intensity recovery with a t 1/2 of 52 s ( Figure 5c ). Aging TDP-43 droplets in vitro for as little as 2 h dramatically decreased interior dynamics, with the proportion of recovery after photobleaching diminished (only 20% recovery within 200 s) ( Figure 5c , d ), consistent with time-dependent gelation after phase separation.

HSPB1 did not form droplets on its own, but efficiently phase separated into TDP-43 droplets ( Figure 5b ). Remarkably, HSPB1 co-phase separated with both the amino terminal half of TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔLCD , aa 1-273) and the LCD containing carboxy-terminus of TDP-43 (aa 274-414) ( Figure 5e , f ). HSPB1 co-de-mixing with TDP-43 altered the properties of TDP-43 droplets, delaying their maturation into gels/solids ( Figure 5c , d ). Additionally, HSPB1 inhibited phase separation of TDP-43 when present at molar concentrations two-fold or higher above the TDP-43 concentration ( Extended Data Fig. 4d - f ). After extended incubation, the LCD of TDP-43 spontaneously formed amyloid fibrils (as previously shown 43 - 48 ) whose presence could be visualized by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence ( Figure 5g ) and negative-stain electron microscopy ( Figure 5h ). HSPB1 prevented this fibril assembly in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5g , h ).

NMR spectroscopy was then used to determine which region(s) of TDP-43 directly bind HSPB1. Since titration of HSPB1 into 15 N-labeled TDP-43 LCD induced co-precipitation of it with the TDP-43 LCD (consistent with the known tendency of HSPB1 to precipitate at high concentration), we mimicked the known stress-induced phosphorylation of HSPB1 49 - 51 by converting serines 15, 78, 82 to aspartates (to produce HSPB1 3D ). The resultant phosphorylation-mimicking HSPB1 exhibited behavior similar to wild type HSPB1 in TDP-43 de-mixing and fibrillation assays ( Extended Data Fig. 5a - c ). Titration of HSPB1 3D with 15 N-labeled TDP-43 LCD enabled acquisition of high-resolution NMR spectra. HSPB1 3D produced a dose-dependent global decrease in TDP-43 LCD signal intensities ( Extended Data Fig. 5d - f ) that were most prominently clustered in a highly conserved 20 amino acid region 52 , 53 (aa 320-340) of TDP-43 ( Extended Data Fig. 5e - g ) previously reported 52 to transiently adopt an α-helical conformation and to be essential in mediating phase separation of TDP-43. Therefore, HSPB1 binding to this conserved sub-domain of the TDP-43 LCD can act to prevent amyloid fibril formation by TDP-43. Beyond the LCD domain, examination by immunostaining and immunoprecipitation of TDP-43 deleted in RRM1 revealed that this domain also plays an important role in binding with HSPB1 ( Extended Data Fig. 5h - j ).

The small heat shock proteins, like HSPB1, have been shown to hold client substrates in a folding-competent state and to work in concert with the ATP-dependent chaperone HSP70 to facilitate efficient substrate refolding 54 - 57 . HSP70, along with the small heat shock protein HSPB8 and the HSP70 nucleotide exchange factor BAG3, have been reported to cooperatively maintain the reversibility of stress granule assembly 51 . Recognizing this, we tested if members of the HSP70 family, its HSP40 co-chaperones, and the known HSP70 n ucleotide e xchange f actor s (NEFs) are recruited to cytoplasmic droplets of TDP-43. For this, we chose: 1) the two abundant members of the HSP40 family (DNAJA1 and DNAJB1); 2) four ubiquitously expressed NEFs (BAG1, BAG2, BAG3 and HSPH1); and 3) HSPB8, a small heat shock protein implicated in stress granule disassembly 15 ( Extended Data Fig. 6 ).

HSPB1 phase separated into arsenite-induced TDP-43-containing droplets at early times, with the amount de-mixed increasing in a time-dependent manner ( Extended Data Fig. 6a , b ). HSP70-HSC70 ( Extended Data Fig. 6c ) and BAG2 ( Extended Data Fig. 6d ) were enriched in TDP-43 droplets at early times (with diminishing amounts at later stages). Stress-induced TDP-43 droplets did not recruit HSPB8 ( Extended Data Fig. 6e ), HSPH1 ( Extended Data Fig. 6f ), BAG3 ( Extended Data Fig. 6g ), DNAJA1 ( Extended Data Fig. 6h ), DNAJB1 ( Extended Data Fig. 6i ), or BAG1 ( Extended Data Fig. 6j ).

Stress-induced assemblies of RNA binding proteins, like stress granules, typically dissolve after removal of stress 15 . Consistent with this, live cell imaging revealed that in approximately half of our cells, arsenite-induced cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separated droplets/gels dissolved within 8-12 hours after arsenite removal ( Figure 6a , b ; Supplementary Movie 3 ). Cells that failed to resolve the TDP-43-containing condensates also failed to recover, instead undergoing cell shrinkage, detachment from the dish, and death.

We next tested if depletion of HSPB1, BAG2, or HSPA1A (a major inducible HSP70 family member) affected resolution of stress-induced TDP-43 droplets/gels. For this, we suppressed HSPB1, BAG2, or HSPA1A by transfection of the corresponding siRNAs ( Extended Data Fig. 7a - c ) and then induced expression of fluorescently tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover - Figure 6a ). While decrease of HSPB1, HSPA1A, or BAG2 did not affect arsenite induction of cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation, reduction in any of the three sharply slowed disassembly after stress removal ( Figure 6c - g ). Likewise, depletion of HSPB1 strongly inhibited the disassembly of arsenite-induced droplets/gels of RNA binding deficient TDP-43 ( Extended Data Fig. 7d , e ), while reduction of HSPA1A ( Extended Data Fig. 7f ) [and to a lesser extent BAG2 ( Extended Data Fig. 7g )] delayed their disassembly. Strikingly, partial inhibition of HSP70 family chaperone activity [by addition of the HSP70/HSC70 ATPase inhibitor VER155008 at a level too low to induce TDP-43 de-mixing ( Extended Data Fig. 7h )] blocked disassembly of arsenite-induced cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets ( Extended Data Fig. 7i ). In addition, increase of HSPB1 in cells by 2-6 fold inhibited arsenite-induced TDP-43 de-mixing and promoted cell recovery ( Figure 6h - i ).

Although reduction in HSPA1A strongly inhibited disassembly of TDP-43 droplets ( Figure 6d ), depletion of HSPA8, the constitutive HSP70 family member originally referred to as HSC70, led to induction of HSPA1A ( Extended Data Fig. 8a - c ) [as previously reported 58 ] and acceleration of disassembly of cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets/gels ( Extended Data Fig. 8d - f ). Increased accumulation of HSPA1A (following depletion of HSPA8) also inhibited arsenite induced cytoplasmic droplets of both TDP-43 RNA binding competent ( Extended Data Fig. 8d , f , g ) and RNA binding deficient TDP-43 ( Extended Data Fig. 8h ), consistent with a higher chaperone activity of HSPA1A versus HSPA8 for inhibiting TDP-43 phase separation and accelerated resolution of de-mixed droplets/gels ( Extended Data Fig. 8i ). After stress removal there was enhanced recruitment of HSP70 and stress-inducible co-chaperones of HSP70 (i.e., BAG3 and DNAJB1, but not DNAJA1) to stress-induced TDP-43 droplets ( Extended Data Fig. 9a ), further supporting the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of HSP70 in the disassembly of TDP-43 droplets. In addition, disruption (by nocodazole addition) of the normal assembled microtubule array did not measurably affect formation and fusion/coalescence of arsenite-induced cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets, but it did inhibit their disassembly after stress removal ( Extended Data Fig. 9b - e ).

Taken together, the combined activities of HSPB1, BAG2, and HSPA1A facilitate disassembly of stress-induced, stress granule-independent, phase separated cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets.

Recognizing that HSPB1 has been implicated to affect neuronal differentiation 59 , 60 , neurite growth 61 , and axon regeneration 62 , 63 , we determined HSPB1 expression level in motor neurons. Examination of cell type specific translation profiling data from motor neurons 64 and single cell transcriptomic data 65 identified HSPB1 to be expressed at moderate levels in normal motor neurons (the 509 th most expressed mRNA in the translation profiling data 64 ), with ~8 times lower levels in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes ( Figure 7a - c ), features confirmed by in situ hybridization data of adult mouse spinal cord 66 .

We tested if HSPB1 amount or subcellular localization changed in motor neurons in ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology ( Figure 7d - e ). Examination of spinal cord sections from three patients with sporadic ALS and one familial ALS individual with a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene ( Supplementary Table 2a - b ) revealed that a large majority (between 59% (patient #81) and 90% (patient#107)) of the remaining motor neurons had cytoplasmic TDP-43 pathology, with many (44%-78%) displaying obvious loss of nuclear TDP-43 ( Figure 7f - g , Source Data Fig. 7 ). Most remarkably, HSPB1 levels were markedly and reproducibly reduced in the surviving ALS patient motor neurons ( Figure 7f - h , Source Data Fig. 7 ). The fraction of motor neurons accumulating a normal level of HSPB1 decreased to between 13% and 31% in ALS patient motor neurons ( Figure 7f - h , Source Data Fig. 7 ). This was most strongly seen in comparing the level of HSPB1 in ALS patient motor neurons with nuclear TDP-43 to those with TDP-43 pathology ( Figure 7i , Source Data Fig. 7 ). In non-ALS control individuals, no motor neurons had cytoplasmic TDP-43 abnormalities, with almost all (>90%) of them containing both nuclear TDP-43 and high levels of HSPB1.

Transfection of siRNA to HSPB1 ( Figure 8a ) was used to determine that depletion of HSPB1 promoted phase separation of cytoplasmic, RNA binding incompetent TDP-43 (TDP-43 ΔNLS-5FL-Clover ) into droplets in both cycling ( Figure 8b ) and G1/G0 arrested ( Extended Data Fig. 10a - d ) cells. HSPB1 reduction also induced nuclear TDP-43 (TDP-43 Clover-APEX2 ) mis-localization to the cytoplasm ( Figure 8c - e ). A similar trend of increased cytoplasmic mis-localization was observed for endogenous TDP-43 ( Extended Data Fig. 10e - f ) (with the increased size [102 kD for TDP-43 Clover-APEX2 versus 43 kD for TDP-43] making it a more sensitive marker for a nuclear import defect).

Another nuclear protein with a classical nuclear-localization sequence (e.g., hnRNPU – Figure 8e ) was also mis-localized when HSPB1 was reduced, while the PY-NLS-containing FUS was not, suggestive of a potential role for HSPB1 in facilitating import of at least some classical NLS-containing proteins. RanGAP1, which maintains cytoplasmic Ran in a GDP bound form thereby enabling nuclear import by importins 67 , 68 , has been reported to be mis-localized in neurodegenerative diseases 69 , 70 , including ALS 71 - 73 . Indeed, beyond decrease in HSPB1 promoting cytoplasmic TDP-43 mis-localization and induction of its cytoplasmic de-mixing, RanGAP1 was mis-localized when HSPB1 level was reduced ( Figure 8f ), consistent with reduction in Ran-dependent nuclear import.

HSPB1 variants have previously been reported in ALS patients 74 - 76 ( Supplementary Table 3a ), including mutation in a heat shock response element sequence in the promoter region and missense mutations in the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain. Recognizing this, we examined four large human genome projects, including the Project MinE 77 ( http://databrowser.projectmine.com/ ), the ALS Variant Server 78 ( http://als.umassmed.edu/ ), the ALS Data Browser 79 ( http://alsdb.org/ ), and the ALS Knowledge Portal 80 ( http://alskp.org/ ), which in total have currently collected complete genome sequences from 8625 ALS patients and 9671 non-ALS individuals. Our search identified a probable enrichment in HSPB1 missense or frameshift variants in ALS patients (p = 0.068 77 ), with 22 variants overall, 14 of which were not found in controls - Supplementary Table 3a - b ).

## Discussion
Discovery that neurodegenerative disease-causing RNA binding proteins (like TDP-43 and FUS) have intrinsically disordered low complexity domains that can spontaneously undergo de-mixing and subsequently convert into amyloid fibrils in vitro 6 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 43 - 48 , 53 , 81 , highlights the unresolved question of how the de-mixed liquid-like state is maintained in normal cells. Prior work has identified reversible acetylation of TDP-43 and the activity of the HSP70 protein folding chaperone family to modulate intranuclear phase separation of TDP-43 into anisosomes comprised of a liquid outer shell of TDP-43 and an inner liquid core of HSP70 14 . When accumulated into cytoplasm TDP-43 also forms liquid-like phase separated droplets which under stress are dynamically arrested to form gel/solid-like structures. Here we have identified HSPB1, along with HSP70 chaperone activity, to be required for maintaining the liquid state of phase separated TDP-43 droplets in the cytoplasm. Binding of HSPB1 is direct, mediated through TDP-43’s RNA binding and low complexity domains, with HSPB1 partitioning into TDP-43 droplets and inhibiting droplet aging and assembly of TDP-43 into fibrils.

Accumulating evidence points to the importance of the chaperone system for maintaining the neuronal proteome 20 - 23 , 82 - 92 . A decreased or impaired heat shock protein system leads to the formation of protein aggregates in models of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease 22 and Parkinson’s disease 83 , 84 . An increase in HSPB1 has been reported to be beneficial in the early disease stage of a model for SOD1 mutant-mediated ALS 90 , albeit the benefit was not maintained at later disease stages. Our study suggests that HSPB1 functions together with the HSP70 chaperone machinery to regulate the phase separated state of TDP-43. Recognizing that cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusion is the most common characteristic feature of ALS and related disorders 2 , approaches to increase levels of heat shock chaperones and other components of the protein quality control machinery could therefore hold promise for therapy.

HSPB1 is an ATP-independent chaperone predominantly localized within the cytoplasm 93 , 94 and with a central α-crystalline domain flanked by two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at N- and C-termini 24 , 51 , 95 . It normally forms a range of oligomers (12 to 30-mers, ~500-1100 kDa) mediated by its IDRs, with the most common form in cells thought to be the 24 mer 93 which is in rapid, reversible equilibrium with monomers, dimers, and other higher order oligomers 93 , 94 . This dynamic behavior of HSPB1 is thought to render it an efficient chaperone when ATP is limited (like after exposure to sodium arsenite 96 , 97 ). In line with this, we have identified increased recruitment of HSPB1 to cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets, along with the recruitment of ATP-dependent HSP70 and its BAG2 co-chaperone, evidence supporting a central role of HSPB1 in maintaining TDP-43 proteostasis under oxidative stress.

HSPB1 has previously been shown (using in vitro phase separation and NMR) to prevent aging of phase separated FUS LCD into fibrils 51 . To this, we have shown that HSPB1 interaction with TDP-43 is through a region of the LCD which prior NMR efforts had demonstrated to transiently convert into a helical structure 81 . We also have detected an interaction of HSPB1 with the TDP-43 RRM domain, especially RRM1 ( Extended Data Fig. 5h - j ). These data are in line with reports of RNA binding inhibiting TDP-43 phase separation 98 , 99 , disease-causing mutations in RRM1 enhancing TDP-43 phase separation 100 , and TDP-43 RRM1 having two cysteine residues (Cys173, Cys175) that are sensitive to oxidative stress 101 - 103 . Oxidation of these cysteines results in disulfide bond formation and a conformational change that facilitates TDP-43 aggregation 102 , 103 , consistent with our demonstration in cells that liquid-to-gel transitions of TDP-43 droplets rely on the RRMs of TDP-43. While HSPB8, another small heat shock protein implicated in neuromuscular disease 104 , has been recently reported to bind to the unfolded RRM of FUS and delay the aging of FUS condensates 105 , we did not find HSPB8 recruited to cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separated droplets.

To prior efforts of how de-mixed RNA/RBP condensates are disassembled in cells 15 , 106 , 107 , our demonstration that HSPB1 facilitates disassembly of TDP-43 de-mixed droplets ( Figure 6 ) offers what we believe is strong evidence for the proposal that binding of HSPB1 to TDP-43 in gel/solid structures acts to maintain TDP-43 in a refolding-capable state that facilitates its refolding. After removal of a provoking stress and restoration of ATP levels, HSPB1 enhances droplet resolution ( Figure 8g ; Extended Data Fig. 9a ) acting in conjunction with the HSP70 family chaperones, BAG2, BAG3, and HSP40 (e.g., DNAJB1 but not DNAJA1 [in line with recent report of the unique function DNAJB family proteins 108 ]), whose expression is induced to facilitate ATP-fueled substrate refolding ( Figure 8g ). Decrease of HSPB1 also leads to mis-localization of RanGAP1, partial inhibition of nuclear import, and a corresponding increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation ( Figure 8c , f ).

HSPB1 mutations have been reported in multiple motor neuron diseases, including Charcot-Marie tooth (CMT) disease 109 , 110 , distal hereditary motor dystrophy 111 - 113 , and ALS 74 , 76 , with sequence variants scattered throughout HSPB1 and an enrichment in the α-crystallin domain 111 , 113 . Some CMT mutations (R127W, S135F, and R136W) in this domain have been shown to increase chaperone activity, with mutation in the C-terminus (P182L) enhancing aggregation of HSPB1 114 . How the HSPB1 sequence variants found in ALS affect chaperone activity and binding to TDP-43 is not established, although some have been reported to have increased binding to tubulin, thereby disturbing microtubule dynamics 115 , 116 . Indeed, we not only determined that retention of an assembled microtubule array was necessary for rapid TDP-43 droplet disassembly, but also in our proximity labeling dataset we identified an increased proximity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 to β-tubulins. These findings raise a future direction to determine whether cytoplasmic TDP-43 affects HSPB1 function in tubulin folding/refolding.

## Methods
All experiments performed in this study were approved by the institutional ethical review committee of University of California, San Diego.

Plasmid information is listed in Supplementary table 4 . The vectors are built by Gibson assembly or double-restriction digestion cloning method.

Cell lines used in this paper are: HEK293T (ATCC: CRL-11268), U2OS (ATCC: HTB-96) and the human inducible Ngn2 iPSC line (ALSTEM, iP11N), and the human inducible NGN2, ISL1, and LHX3 iPSC line 117 , a gift from Dr. Michael Ward’s group at NIH. Routine maintenance of these model cell lines follows the guideline posted on ATCC. In brief, U2OS and HEK293T cells were cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. iPSC cells are cultured on Matrigel-coated plates in mTeSR ™ plus medium.

Lentivirus is produced in HEK293t cells by transfection of lentiviral plasmid and packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 using TransIT-VirusGEN ® Transfection Reagent (Mirus, MIR6705). After two days of transfection, the culture medium containing the lentivirus was passed through a 0.45 μm filter and was used to infect U2OS cell line. After two days of infection, the medium is exchanged to medium containing 20 μg/μL blasticidin or 2 μg/μL puromycin for selection. Single clones are sorted by SH800S Cell Sorter (Sony).

iPSCs are first induced to differentiate to neural precursor cells 117 by culturing into induction medium (DMEM/F12, 1x N2 supplement, 1x GlutaMAX, 1x non-essential amino acids, 0.2 μM compound E (only for iPSC-motor neurons), 2 μg/mL doxycycline, 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632) for 1 day and then replaced with induction medium (no ROCK inhibitor) for 1 day. Then neural precursor cells are treated with Accutase and plated onto 8-well chamber slide (iBidi, 80827) coated with poly-L-ornithine and laminin with neural culture medium (Neurobasal, 1xN2 supplement, 1xB27 supplement, 1x GlutaMAX, 1x non-essential amino acids, 10 ng/mL BDNF, 10 ng/mL GDNF, 1 μg/mL laminin). Medium is replaced 50% every two days.

Before labeling, U2OS cells were treated with the indicated reagents and biotin phenol (Iris-Biotech, 41994-02-9) containing medium was further added to 250 μM final concentration and treated for 30 min. Then 1 mM hydrogen peroxide was added to the medium to activate APEX labeling reaction for 1 min, followed by immediate quenching of reaction with ice-cold quenching buffer (1xPBS, 10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 2.5 mM Trolox). After four washes with cold quenching buffer, the cells were collected from plates with scrapers. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mM NaPO4, PH 8.0, 8 M Urea, 1% SDS, 10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox, 10 mM TCEP) and passed through an insulin syringe for 15 times to break DNA. After sonication at water bath sonicator for 10 mins, protein lysates are cleared by centrifuge. Protein concentration was measured using 2-D quant kit (GE healthcare, Cat# 80648356), by following manufacturer’ instruction. After alkylation with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min, 0.5 mg of protein samples were aliquoted and equilibrated to the same volume with lysis buffer. After dilution with equal volume of ddH2O to reduce the concentration of urea to 4 M and SDS to 0.5%, the samples were incubated with streptavidin magnetic AccuNanobeads (Bioneer, Cat# TA-1015-1) at 4 °C overnight.

After three washes with wash buffer 1 (100 mM TEAB, PH 8.0, 4 M Urea, 0.5% SDS) and four washes with wash buffer 2 (100 mM TEAB, PH 8.0, 4 M Urea), the beads were resuspended in 100 mM TEAB, 2 M Urea supplemented with 10 ng/uL Trypsin, 5 ng/uL Lys-C for pre-digestion at 37 °C on a thermomixer shaking at 1,000 rpm. The pre-digested products were collected, and an additional 10 ng/uL Trypsin were added to digest overnight at with 1% 37 °C. Digested peptides from each sample are labeled with TMT six-plex labeling reagents (Thermo, Cat# 90061) following manufacture instruction. Briefly, TMT reagents are solubilized in anhydrous acetonitrile and add to peptides from each sample according to the labeling design in Supplementary Table 1 . After 1-hr reaction at RT, 5% hydroxylamine was added and incubated for 15 mins to quench the reaction. Then equal volume of peptides of each sample in the same group are pooled together and speedvac to remove acetonitrile. The samples are acidified with formic acid (1%, final concentration) and desalted using Pierce C18 spin columns (89870).

The TMT labeled samples were analyzed on a Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo). Samples were injected directly onto a 25 cm, 100 μm ID column packed with BEH 1.7 μm C18 resin (Waters). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min on a nLC 1200 (Thermo). Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile and 80% acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 0–25% B over 75 min, an increase to 40% B over 30 min, an increase to 100% B over another 10 min and held at 100% B for a 5 min was used for a 120 min total run time.

Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and nano-sprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.5 kV voltage at the back of the column. The Eclipse was operated in a data dependent mode. Full MS1 scans were collected in the Orbitrap at 120k resolution. The cycle time was set to 3 s, and within this 3 s the most abundant ions per scan were selected for collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry in the ion trap. MS3 analysis with multi-notch isolation (SPS3) was utilized for detection of TMT reporter ions at 7.5k resolution 118 . Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled, and dynamic exclusion was used with exclusion duration of 60 s.

The raw data was processed by Rawconverter 119 to extract MS2 and MS3 spectra with a correction of each precursor ion peak to its monoisotopic peak when appropriate. MS2 and MS3 mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a complete human protein database downloaded from Uniprot with the addition of APEX2 and Clover protein sequence using the search algorithm ProLuCID 120 . The searching parameters are: precursor mass tolerance of 50 ppm, fragment ion tolerance of 500 ppm for CID spectra and of 20 ppm for HCD spectra; minimum peptide length of 6 amino acids; static modifications for carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N-termini (+229.162932 Da). The identified peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were filtered to an FDR of ≤1% at a PSM level with DTASelect2 121 . The FDR was calculated based on the number of PSMs that matched to sequences in the reverse decoy database. TMT quantification of reporter ions from MS3 spectra is done by Census2 122 with the filter of over 0.6 for isobaric purity. The normalized intensity based on weighted normalization were used to calculate the ratio of reporter ions corresponding to the indicated groups. The ratios of each protein from three forward labeling groups and three reverse labeling groups ( Supplementary Table 1 ) were used to calculate P-value through one sample t-test. The volcano plot was generated with R package.

Human tissues were obtained from the UCSD ALS tissue repository that was created following HIPAA-compliant informed consent procedures approved by Institutional Review Boards (either Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA IRB# 10058 or University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA IRB# 120056) and de-identified at time of acquisition. Informed consent was obtained on all subjects and there was no compensation.

Tissue samples were obtained from patients who met the modified El Escorial criteria for definite ALS. Control nervous systems were obtained from non-neurological patients when life support was withdrawn, or from patients on hospice. Tissues were acquired using a short-postmortem interval acquisition protocol usually under 6 hours. Tissues were immediately dissected in the autopsy suite, placed in labelled cassettes and fixed in neutral buffered formalin for at least 2 weeks before being dissected and paraffin embedded for indefinite storage.

On day one, sections were deparaffinized with Citrisolv (FISHER brand #04-355-121) and hydrated through a serial dilution of ethanol. Sections were permeabilized with 1% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals #511150) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma #65H2616). Following permeabilization, antigen retrieval was performed in a high pH solution (Vector # H- 3301) in a pressure cooker for 20 min at 120 °C. Next, sections were blocked with 2% FBS in 1 × PBS for 60 min and were incubated with primary antibody overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% FBS in 1X PBS. On day two, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 2% FBS in 1X PBS for 60 min at room temperature. We quenched CNS auto-fluorescence with 0.1% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol for 15 seconds. Slides were cover slipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with or without DAPI. We analyzed two to four 8-μm sections per patient. Motor neurons were identified by their large size, multipolar cytoplasm, presence of lipofuscin, and large nucleus with a less dense DAPI staining in IF studies.

ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs (Horizon Discovery) targeting HSPB1 (L-005269-00-0005), HSPA1A (L-005168-00-0005), BAG2 (L-011961-00-0005) or HSPA8 (L-017609-00-0005) are transfected to U2OS cells at a concentration of 3 fmol/5,000 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermofisher, 13778075) for three or four days before the experiment.

U2OS cells are plated onto SCREENSTAR 96-well microplate (Greiner, #655866) at 10,000 cells/well with normal medium and after 1 day are changed to 1% FBS-supplemented DMEM with 1 μM palbociclib. After three days of treatment, cells are trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A and stained with propidium iodide (PI) solution. Then DNA contents are analyzed by BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer. The plot was generated with Flowjo; the gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Figure S1 .

U2OS cells are plated onto the 96-well plate (Greiner, #655866) with DMEM medium, no phenol red, and treated as indicated. Images are taken by CQ1 benchtop high-content analysis with a 40x/1.2 objective under a constant CO 2 flow.

U2OS cells for FRAP experiments were cultured on an 8-well chamber slide (iBidi, 80827) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermofisher, 15240062). Expression of TDP-43 variants was induced 24 hour or 48 hours as indicated by adding 1 μg/mL doxycycline to the culture medium. FRAP analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM880 Aryscan microscope with 40x/1.2 W objective using Zen software. The intensity of the fluorescent signal is controlled in the detection range through changing the laser power, digital gain and off-set. For green and red fluorescent channels, bleaching was conducted by 488-nm or 561-nm line correspondingly and the laser power and iteration of bleaching are optimized to get an efficient bleaching effect. Fluorescence recovery was monitored at 1 second intervals for 2 minutes. In the focal-bleach experiment, roughly half (partial bleach) or all (full bleach) of de-mixing structures was photobleached to determine the molecular mobility with diffuse pool or inside a condensate.

The FRAP data were quantified using ImageJ. The time series of the fluorescence intensity of condensates were calculated. The intensity of the droplet during the whole experiment was normalized to the one before bleaching and the intensity of the droplet just after bleaching was normalized to zero. At least 6-10 images were analyzed per condition to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The averaged relative intensity and standard error were plotted to calculate dynamics.

For immunofluorescence, U2OS cells were cultured on 8-well chamber slides (iBidi, 80827) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermofisher, 15240062). After treatments of the cells as indicated, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking with 2% BSA in PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100 for 2 hours, cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with primary antibody in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa647-labeled, Cy3-labeled or Alexa488-labeled secondary antibody at 1:500 dilution or Alexa647-streptavidin at 1:1000 dilution for APEX labeling experiment in blocking solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. After three washes with PBS and DAPI staining, cells were kept in PBS for imaging. Dilutions for primary antibodies used in this study are 1:300 for anti-HSPB1 (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-1048; rabbit polyclonal, Stressmarq, SPC-106B, Lot#1201), 1: 100 for anti-HSP70/HSC70 (mouse monoclonal, Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-SPA-820),anti-HSP70 (mouse monoclonal, Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-SPA-810), anti-HSC70 (rat monoclonal, Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-SPA-815), 1:500 for anti-BAG1 (mouse monoclonal, Novus Biologicals, H00000573-M02, Lot#F8031-2D3), anti-BAG2 (Rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, NB100-56087, Lot# AR99-091613), anti-BAG3(Rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, NBP2-27398, Lot#102119), anti-DNAJB1 (rabbit polyclonal, Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-SPA-400, Lot# 07051758), anti-DNAJA1 (rabbit polyclonal, Proteintech, 11713-1-AP), anti-HSP110 (rabbit polyclonal, Proteintech, 13383-1-AP) and anti-HSPB8 (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, NBP2-67836). 1: 300 for anti-EIF3η (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-16377).

U2OS cells were plated on gridded coverslips (Mattek, P35G-1.5-14-CGRD-D), induced by doxycycline to express TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover or Clover alone and pre-incubated with SPY-650 DNA dye for 24 hr. After 1 hour treatment with sodium arsenite, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 20 min at RT and then changed to 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for imaging. High resolution imaging is taken by DeltaVision Elite microscope (Cytiva) with 100x objective at 0.1 μm Z interval for the whole cell volume. Then the cells are fixed by 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate for 4-5 min at RT and then overnight at 4°C. After fixation, cells were washed five times with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and stained with 1% OsO4 in 0.1M SC buffer for 45 minutes on ice. Then OsO4-stained cells were washed with 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer five times and MilliQ water for 2 times. After that, coverslips were stained in 2% uranyl acetate buffer for 45 minutes and then rinsed with Milli-Q water. Samples were dehydrated with 20%, 50%, 70%, 90% ETOH followed by two times with 100% ETOH, 1 min each time, and then dried with acetone for 2x1min. After dehydration, samples were incubated at RT in Ducurpan:Acetone=50/50 for 1 hour, and in fresh 100% Durcupan for two times, 1 hour each time. Coverslips were then embedded in Durcupan resin, and the regions of interest navigated by the grid network were cut into 60nm ultrathin sections by diamond knife. Sections were mounted on 300 mesh grids for TEM imaging on FEI Tecnai Spirit G2 BioTWIN. Fluorescent image and TEM image of the same cell are manually correlated with Image J.

All hybridization steps were performed following the Stellaris RNA FISH protocol for adherent cells. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 minutes and then permeabilized with ethanol 70% overnight at 4°C. Then, cells were washed once with wash buffer A (Biosearch Technologies, SMF-WA1-60) supplemented with 10% deionized formamide (Sigma, F7503) for 5 min, and incubated with Hybridization Buffer (SMF-HB1-10) supplemented with 10% deionized formamide and 1ng/ml Cy5-labeled Cy5-(d)T20 oligonucleotides (gift from Dr. J. Paul Taylor, St. Jude Children Hospital) in the dark at 37°C for 4 hours in a humidified chamber. After cells were washed with wash buffer A in the dark at 37°C for 30 minutes, cells were stained with DAPI in wash buffer A, and then washed once with wash buffer B (Biosearch Technologies, SMF-WB1-20) before imaging.

U2Os cells were cultured at 6-well plate and each well of cells were lysed in 300 μL of RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris•HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1000 unit/mL Benzonase (Millipore, 70746) and 1x Halt ™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermofisher, 78440). The cell lysates were passed through 28G Insulin Syringe (Fisher Scientific, 14-829-1A) for eight times and lysed on ice for 20 min. Then cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 g for 20 min and supernatants were collected as the soluble fraction. The pellet fractions were washed once with 500 μL of RIPA buffer and solubilized in 100 μL of 1xLDS (Thermofisher, B0007) running buffer as the insoluble fraction.

U2OS cells were treated with 250 μM sodium arsenite for 2 hr before collected with cell scraper. Cell pellets from one 10-cm dish were lysed in 1 mL of 1xIP lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 and 5% glycerol) supplemented with 1000 unit/mL Benzonase (Millipore, 70746) and 1x Halt ™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermofisher, 78440). Cell lysates were passed through 28G Insulin Syringe (Fisher Scientific, 14-829-1A) for eight times and lysed on ice for 20 min. The release of TDP-43 droplets in cell lysates were checked under microscope. Then cell debris were removed by 20 min centrifuge at 1,500 g. The droplets containing supernatant were collected and incubated with GFP-Trap Magnetic Particles M-270 (Chromotek) at 4 °C for 4 hours. After incubation, 5 μL of samples were taken to examine the efficiency of GFP binding on the beads under fluorescence microscope. Then, the beads were collected by magnet stand and washed with 1 mL lysis buffer for 4 times before eluted with 1xLDS (Thermofisher, B0007) running buffer at 80 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer. One percent of input and ten percent of IP sample were used for western analysis.

Protein samples were loaded onto 12% Criterion ™ TGX ™ Precast Midi Protein Gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Immobilon ® -FL PVDF Membrane (Millipore). Then membrane was blocked with Intercept Blocking Buffer (LICOR) and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution for HSPB1 monoclonal antibody, StressMarq, 5D12-A12; 1:2000 dilution for GAPDH polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling 14C10; 1:1000 dilution for TDP-43 C-terminal antibody, Proteintech, 12892-1-AP) overnight at 4 °C. After four washes with TBST, membrane was incubated with secondary antibody (1:20,000 for IRDye ® 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse, LICOR 926-32212, and IRDye ® 680RD Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG, LICOR 926-68073 or 1:5,000 for HRP Donkey anti-Mouse, Invitrogen). Then membrane was imaged by LICOR Odyssey ® Imager.

A plasmid encoding MBP (maltose binding protein)-H3C-TDP-TEV-COVER-His6 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain LOBSTR (Kerafast) which were cultured at 37 °C in 2XYT media in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol an optical density value 0.8 at 600 nm, induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and then cultured for a further 16 h at 20 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM NaN 3 ) plus 1 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. For purification, cells were lysed by sonication, then clarified lysates were loaded onto a Ni 2+ affinity column (Ni-NTA Superflow; Qiagen), washed in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, and eluted in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 400 mM imidazole. For cleavage of MBP, proteins were buffer exchanged to buffer A plus 300mM NaCl and 40mM imidazole, then incubated 48 hours at 4 °C with GST-tagged Prescission protease (human rhinovirus 3C protease). Cleavage reactions were passed through a Ni 2+ affinity column again to remove MBP and GST-tagged Prescission protease. Elution fractions containing TDP-TEV-COVER-His6 were concentrated in centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Ultra, EMD Millipore) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL; Cytiva) in gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Purified proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C for analysis.

TDP-43 LCD and its variant A326P were overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) chemically component cells (Transgene, Beijing). After the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h to induce the expression of the protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended with buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl), following sonication in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride buffer. The supernatant of cell lysate was loaded onto a Ni 2+ column (GE Healthcare, USA) after filtration with a 0.22 μm filter. Proteins were then eluted by the denatured elution buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, and 100 mM imidazole. The eluted fraction was concentrated to a concentration above 30 mg/mL, and proteins were desalted into the buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.0) for further experiment.

TDP-43 ΔLCD was overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) chemically component cells. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG at 25 °C for 12 h. Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and 2 mM PMSF. After filtration, the cell lysates were load onto the Ni column and eluted by elution buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were stored at −80 °C, and they were desalted into the buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) before the experiment. Full-length MBP tagged TDP-43 (TDP-43-MBP) was overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS Chemically Competent Cells (Transgene, Beijing). Proteins were induced by adding 1mM IPTG, and cells were cultured at 16 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM PMSF. The cell lysates were centrifuged and filtered before loading onto the MBP Trap HP column. Proteins were then eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM maltose. Eluted fractions were further purified over the size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 pg, GE, USA) in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT.

HSPB1 wild-type (HSPB1 WT) and its point mutant HSPB1 3D were overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) chemically component cells and proteins were induced by 0.5 mM IPTG. After cultured at 25 °C for 16 h, cells were collected and lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol. The cell lysates were centrifuged and filtered before loading onto the Ni column. Following elution with the elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol), the collected fraction was further purified by the size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 pg, GE, USA) in buffer containing 50 mM PB, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.

Proteins for NMR spectroscopy were expressed with E. coli , incubated in the M9 minimal medium with 15 N-labeled NHCl 4 (1 g/L) as the sole nitrogen source. Purification of 15 N-labeled proteins followed the same procedures as that for the unlabeled proteins.

For fluorescence labeling, Alexa-488 (A10254, Invitrogen, USA) was for TDP-43-MBP, Alexa-647 (A20347, Invitrogen, USA) was for TDP-43 ΔLCD, OregonGreen488 (Invitrogen, O6149) was for TDP-43 LCD and Alexa-555 (A20346, Invitrogen, USA) was for HSPB1 WT and 3D. All the labeling experiments were performed as described by the manufacturer.

For in vitro co-liquid-liquid phase separation assay, purified TDP-43 LCD and HSPB1 were diluted into the buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) at final concentrations of 50 μM (TDP-43 LCD) and 10 μM (HSPB1), respectively. And the phase separation of TDP-43 ΔLCD (50 μM) and HSPB1 (10 μM) were induced in the buffer containing 60 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. In the co-LLPS system of TDP-43 (MBP-tagged or MBP tag-removed by adding TEV protease) TDP-43 and HSPB1, 50 μM TDP-43 and 10 μM HSPB1 were performed in the buffer with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 7.5% Dextran 70. For fluorescence imaging, a 1/50 molar ratio of fluorescence-labeled protein was added to the system. Images were collected by Leica TCS SP8 microscope with a 100 × objective (oil immersion, NA= 1.4) at room temperature.

A titration of TDP-43 Clover-HIS was imaged by CQ1 confocal microscope to get the standard curve of fluorescence intensity and concentration. The same setting was used to image U2OS cells expressing TDP-43 ΔNLS-Clover or TDP-43 ΔNLS/5FL-Clover . The concentration of diffuse TDP-43 was calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity of the region of the cytoplasm subtracted of droplets’ region (recognized by auto threshold method) done by Image J.

All NMR titration experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe in an NMR buffer of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 10% D 2 O. Each NMR sample was made with a volume of 500 μL, containing 10 μM 15 N labeled TDP-43 LCD. We performed the titration experiment by addition of 5 μM or 10 μM HSPB1 and its variant respectively. Bruker standard pulse sequence (hsqcetfpf3gpsi) was used to collect the 2D 1 H- 15 N HSQC spectrum with 32 scans, and 2048 × 160 complex points were used for 1 H (14 ppm) and 15 N (21 ppm) dimension, respectively. Backbone assignment of TDP-43 LCD was accomplished according to the previous publication 12 . All NMR data were processed by NMRPipe 123 and analyzed by Sparky 124 .

ThT fluorescence kinetic assay was performed with 10 μM TDP-43 LCD HIS in the buffer containing 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT, 50 mM ThT and 0.05% NaN 3 . The mixture was applied to a 384-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ThT fluorescence was monitored by a FLUO star Omega Rational Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH) with excitation at 440 nm and emission at 485 nm at 37 °C, and the plate was shaken at 900 rpm with orbital shaking mode.

After agitation in orbital shaker for 36 hours, TDP-43 LCD and TDP-43 LCD/HSPB1 samples from the ThT assay are loaded on the charged carbon film grids. The uranyl acetate (2%, v/v) is used to stain the samples for 45 s. Then, the grids were washed with ddH 2 O twice before the experiment. The TEM images are captured by the Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope. The accelerating voltage of TEM was set to 120 kV, which could avoid the irradiation damage of samples.

Statistical analyses of quantification result were performed using GraphPad Prism. The statistical significance of the differences between two groups was investigated by two-tailed unpaired t test. The number of cells analyzed per experiment is provided in the corresponding figure legends.
