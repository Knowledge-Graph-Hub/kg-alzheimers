Perivascular cells induce microglial phagocytic states and
synaptic engulfment via SPP1 in mouse models of Alzheimer’s
disease

# Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic loss,
which can result from dysfunctional microglial phagocytosis and complement
activation. However, what signals drive aberrant microglia-mediated engulfment of
synapses in AD is unclear. Here we report that secreted phosphoprotein 1
(SPP1/osteopontin) is upregulated predominantly by perivascular macrophages and, to
a lesser extent, by perivascular fibroblasts. Perivascular SPP1 is required for
microglia to engulf synapses and upregulate phagocytic markers including C1qa , Grn and Ctsb in presence of amyloid-β
oligomers. Absence of Spp1 expression in AD mouse models results in prevention of
synaptic loss. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and putative
cell–cell interaction analyses reveal that perivascular SPP1 induces
microglial phagocytic states in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. Altogether,
we suggest a functional role for SPP1 in perivascular cells-to-microglia crosstalk,
whereby SPP1 modulates microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in mouse models of
AD.

## Main
The integrity of neurons and synapses is critically dependent on
brain-resident macrophages, which include microglia and perivascular macrophages
(PVMs) that continuously monitor and clear phagocytic targets across the
lifespan 1 , 2 . Microglia, tissue-resident macrophages of brain
parenchyma, contribute to circuit refinement through engulfment of synapses and axon
tracts during postnatal development, whereas PVMs associate with the perivascular
space where they represent the first responders to toxic agents and pathogens that
may cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) into the brain
parenchyma 3 – 7 . Microglia and PVMs both share similar
yolk-sac origin and reside on the parenchymal side of the BBB, yet occupy distinct
microenvironments and express unique cell-type-specific
markers 8 – 13 . Because of the immediate juxtaposition of
perivascular space with the brain parenchyma, we reasoned that microglia and PVMs
could potentially influence each other to coordinate phagocytosis in response to
central nervous system perturbations. For example, in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), many of the identified risk variants point toward defective phagocytic and
endolysosomal pathways in microglia and PVMs; however, intercellular and
intracellular mechanisms governing this impairment remain
unclear 14 . In line, microglia mediate regional synapse
loss in AD, but environmental cues that modulate potential microglial functional
states are poorly understood 15 .

Here we uncovered secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1/osteopontin),
predominantly derived from PVM, as an extrinsic modulator of microglial
phagocytosis. We observed that SPP1 is required for activation of
complement-initiator C1q and synaptic engulfment by microglia in AD mouse models.
SPP1 has been shown in multiple peripheral tissues to regulate phagocytosis by
macrophages 16 – 20 . In AD patients, secreted SPP1 levels are
increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma; further, SPP1 is found on
plaque-associated microglia and has been suggested as a conserved disease-associated
marker among mice and human 21 – 27 . However, the role of SPP1 in the brain or its
relevance in AD is unknown. Here we found a region-specific activation of SPP1 in
the hippocampal perivascular space of AD mouse models as well as in AD patient
tissues. Super- and ultra-structural examination revealed that SPP1 is expressed
predominantly by PVMs, and to a lesser extent, by perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) in
the adult hippocampus. In mouse models of AD, we found that perivascular SPP1 is
upregulated in a region-specific manner at onset of synaptic elimination by
microglia. Genetic ablation of SPP1 ameliorated microglial phagocytic states in AD
mouse models as well as C1q activation, leading to the prevention of
microglia–synapse engulfment and synapse loss in these mice despite
amyloid-β (Aβ) challenge. Using single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) and computational ligand–target predictions
(NicheNet 28 ), we noted multiple autocrine and paracrine
signaling pathways to be potentially modulated by perivascular SPP1, with many of
these pathways converging on microglial phagocytic functional states. Altogether,
our data suggest a functional crosstalk between PVMs and microglia and propose
perivascular SPP1 as an extrinsic signal that modulates synapse phagocytosis by
microglia.

## Results
To address whether SPP1 is dysregulated at a time point when
synapses are vulnerable to microglial engulfment in an AD-relevant context, we
used the slow-progressing App NL-F mouse model, where control by
the endogenous App promoter allows for
physiological cell-type specific and temporal regulation of Aβ
production 15 , 29 , 30 . We first assessed phagocytic
microglia–synapse interactions in the App NL-F hippocampus at the age of
6 months, an age that precedes robust plaque deposition in the
hippocampal parenchyma 30 . We quantified internalized level of
Homer1-immunoreactive synaptic puncta within
CD68 + P2Y12 + microglial lysosomes and observed
an approximate sevenfold increase in synaptic engulfment by microglia in App NL-F mice
as compared to those of age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 1a,b ). We also observed upregulation
of C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade that mediates
microglial phagocytosis of synapses 3 , 15 , 31 (Fig. 1c,d ). C1qa expression was
contained within Tmem119 + microglia as
assessed by single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH),
confirming microglia as the main producers of C1q in the adult hippocampus (Fig. 1c , insert) 15 , 32 . We next assessed potential
cross-regulation between synaptic engulfment and SPP1, a glycoprotein associated
with phagocytosis in peripheral macrophages, in the 6-month App NL-F hippocampus 18 . Using 3D-stimulated emission depletion
(3D-τ-STED) super-resolution imaging, we found an approximately
threefold increase of punctate SPP1 protein immunoreactivity in the CA1
hippocampus of App NL-F mice as compared to age- and
sex-matched WT controls (Fig. 1e,f ). The
SPP1 upregulation was region-specific, that is, in hippocampus but not
cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b ). In
line with increased SPP1 production, we found an approximate threefold increase
of Spp1 mRNA expression levels in hippocampal
CA1 sections of App NL-F mice compared to WT mice by
smFISH in intact tissue, which was further confirmed by qPCR analysis on brain
homogenates (Fig. 1g,h ). The specificity
of SPP1 antibody and Spp1- targeting smFISH
probes was validated by absence of signals in Spp1 KO/KO mice (Extended Data Fig. 1c ). Fig. 1 SPP1 upregulation at onset of microglia–synapse

Interestingly, Spp1 mRNA
expression in the hippocampal CA1 was specifically enriched within the stratum
lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) layer and Spp1 + cells displayed an elongated
vascular-like pattern (Extended Data Fig. 1d ). Costaining with pan-endothelial marker GLUT1 showed
cellular zonation of Spp1 mRNA expression
adjacent to vascular structures, whereas outside of the endothelial membrane, no Spp1 mRNA was detected (Extended Data
Fig. 1d , inset). Using high-resolution
confocal imaging and 3D surface rendering, we confirmed the close association of
cytosolic SPP1 protein expression with GLUT1 + vasculature (Fig. 1i ). Similar to the
murine App NL-F hippocampus, we also found a striking presence of SPP1 immunoreactivity along
the vasculature in the hippocampus of postmortem AD patient tissues (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Table 1 ). Altogether, these data suggest
that SPP1 expression is enriched along the vasculature in App NL-F mice and AD
patients. Further, we found negligible levels of Aβ oligomers
(oAβ) or plaques at this early time point in the parenchyma of App NL-F hippocampus
(Extended Data Fig. 1e ) 30 . In contrast, however, we observed
oAβ deposition along the hippocampal vasculature at 6 months,
assessed by the oAβ-specific NAB61 + immunostaining juxtaposed to GLUT1 + vasculature (Extended Data Fig. 1f ) 33 . The latter was confirmed using two
other anti-Aβ antibodies, the 4G8 and HJ3.4, which recognize
Aβ17-24 and Aβ1-13, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1g ) 34 . The vascular
oAβ deposition was more pronounced in 15-month App NL-F mice, in contrast to
age-matched WT controls in which no positive NAB61 staining was found (Extended
Data Fig. 1h ). These data suggest early,
preplaque vascular Aβ deposition in the App NL-F , coinciding with SPP1
activation in the perivascular space.

Spp1 expression in 6-month App NL-F hippocampus was remarkably
restricted to cells along the perivascular space (Fig. 1 ). Given the role of SPP1 as a marker of macrophage subsets
in peripheral tissues, we assessed whether Spp1 is expressed by brain-resident
macrophages associated with the vascular space, that is Cd163 + CD206 + PVM 35 . Spp1 mRNA expression predominantly colocalized with
pan-PVM markers Cd163 and CD206 juxtaposed to
GLUT1 + hippocampal vasculature (Fig. 2a,b ). In contrast, we failed to
observe Spp1 expression in Tmem119 hi P2Y12 + microglia of 6-month App NL-F animals
(Extended Data Fig. 2a ). Of note, Spp1 expression in microglia was detected
only at later stages, that is, in 6E10 + plaque-rich 15-month App NL-F hippocampus (Extended Data
Fig. 2b ), likely reflecting
SPP1 + disease-associated
microglia 25 , 36 . Further, immunophenotypic characterization
revealed restricted expression of SPP1 within
CD206 + CX3CR1 + cells, and Spp1 + cells were found
positive for PVM-specific platelet factor 4 ( Pf4 ) and Cd163 (Extended Data
Fig. 2c,d ) 11 , 13 , 37 . Interestingly, we also found rare Spp1 + Cd163 − Pf4 − cells in the hippocampal
perivascular space (Extended Data Fig. 2d ). Spp1 mRNA has been
suggested by scRNA-seq to be expressed by vascular leptomeningeal cells, also
known as PVFs, which are located within parenchymal arteries (Extended Data Fig. 2e ) 37 . Indeed, the second
cluster of Spp1 + cells coexpressed the
pan-PVF marker Pdgfra (encoding CD140a),
suggesting PVFs as a second cellular source of SPP1 surrounding
GLUT1 + vasculature in the hippocampus,
albeit much less abundant compared to PVMs (Extended Data Fig. 2f,c ). Fig. 2 SPP1 is expressed by PVMs and fibroblasts. a – c , Representative images of Spp1 mRNA expression juxtaposed to

To further assess in vivo SPP1 expression, we developed Spp1 -IRES-TdTomato (TdT) ( Spp1 TdT ) reporter mice, which carry
an IRES-TdT cassette in Spp1 exon 7 retaining
endogenous SPP1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c ). Flow cytometric analysis of naïve
animals revealed the expression of Spp1- TdT
within 25.9% of pregated CD45 hi CD206 + PVM, in contrast to
CD11b + CD45 int CX3CR1 hi microglia that were almost devoid of TdT
expression (0.9% of which were TdT + ) (Fig. 2d–f ). Further, only
approximately 6% of total live TdT + cells
were CD140a + (gene product of Pdgfra ), in contrast to 23.9% for
CD206 + , highlighting PVMs as a
predominant cellular source of SPP1 (Fig. 2e,f ). Using high-resolution confocal imaging, we found that
the distribution of SPP1-TdT was comparable to the SPP1 immunoreactivity
detected by IHC (Fig. 1i ), that is,
along GLUT1 + vasculature of the hippocampus
(Extended Data Fig. 3d ). Further, we saw
similar cellular localization of SPP1-TdT within
CD206 + PVMs in the Spp1 TdT hippocampus
(Fig. 2g ). Finally, we used correlative
light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to target and visualize the ultrastructure
and environmental context of SPP1-TdT positive cells in the hippocampus (Fig. 2h , Extended Data Fig. 3e and Supplementary Video 1 ). CLEM identified SPP1-TdT expressing cells
as lysosome-rich PVMs located within the basement membrane of the perivascular
space (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 3e ). CLEM and mRNA in situ
localization identified PVMs as a source for SPP1 in mice, which translated to
human tissue, where we found enrichment of SPP1 within the perivascular space of
AD patients, occasionally overlaying with
CD206 + cells (Fig. 2i ). Collectively, our data suggest that SPP1 is
predominantly expressed by CD206 + Cd163 + Pf4 + PVMs and Pdgfra + /CD140 + PVFs in the mouse hippocampus during onset of microglia–synapse
engulfment. Similar to perivascular SPP1 upregulation in mice, we also found
perivascular SPP1 expression in CA1 hippocampus of AD patient brains.

We next addressed the functional consequences of the SPP1 increase
that spatiotemporally coincides with onset of microglia–synapse
engulfment. To determine whether SPP1 has a role in microglial phagocytosis of
synapses, we first performed intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of
oAβ in WT versus Spp1 -deficient 20 ( Spp1 KO/KO ) mice. As we have previously shown,
oAβ triggers microglia- and complement-mediated synapse
engulfment 15 (Fig. 3a ). Concurrently, we observed a robust upregulation of SPP1
in the contralateral hippocampus of WT mice 18 h after ICV injection of
oAβ (Fig. 3b ). This upregulation
coincided with microglial C1q activation and peak engulfment of
Homer1-immunoreactive synapses by microglia in contralateral hippocampus of
oAβ-injected WT mice (Fig. 3c,d,h ). In contrast, oAβ failed to upregulate C1q or
induce microglial synaptic engulfment in Spp1 KO/KO mice, suggesting that SPP1 is necessary for
microglia–synapse engulfment. Fig. 3 Spp1 modulates
complement activation and microglial synaptic engulfment upon
acute oAβ challenge. a , Scheme illustrating

To test whether Spp1 deficiency
altered phagocytic signature in microglia in 6-month App NL-F mice, we crossed the Spp1 KO/KO mice to App NL-F mice ( App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO ). Using smFISH-IHC and 3D
reconstruction, we observed upregulation of Grn and Ctsb , encoding for
progranulin and Cathepsin B, respectively, key components of the endolysosomal
processing machinery in P2Y12 + microglia of App NL-F animals (Fig. 4a–d ) 14 . However, in the App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO hippocampus, we found substantially
decreased levels of Grn and Ctsb mRNA
expression by P2Y12 + microglia (Fig. 4a–d ). In fact, Grn and Ctsb expression levels were similar to WT and Spp1 KO/KO mice. These results suggest that microglia
fail to adopt phagocytic states in App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice as compared to those of App NL-F mice, despite
oAβ production. Further, we observed a sharp reduction of engulfed
synapses inside P2Y12 + microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice (Fig. 4e,f ). These data altogether suggest that the absence of SPP1
prevents microglial phagocytosis as well as synaptic engulfment in response to
amyloidosis (Figs. 3 – 4 ). We next
tested whether microglia in Spp1 KO/KO mice display intrinsic defective phagocytic
capacity. We assessed the ability of microglia to engulf synaptosomes in vitro
using isolated primary microglia from postnatal WT versus Spp1 KO/KO mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). We found that engulfment of
oAβ-bound synaptosomes was similarly performed by microglia isolated
from either genotype (Extended Data Fig. 4b–e ). This suggests that diminished
microglia–synapse engulfment in Spp1 KO/KO mice in vivo is not due to an inability of
microglia to phagocytose or respond to oAβ, but likely results from
defective extrinsic SPP1 signaling in the brain. Corroborating this hypothesis,
the application of extracellular SPP1 was sufficient to promote
microglia–synapse engulfment in Spp1 KO/KO primary microglia, demonstrating similar
efficiency in engulfing synaptosomes compared to their WT counterparts upon SPP1
pretreatment (Extended Data Fig. 4d–f ). Fig. 4 SPP1 drives microglial engulfment of synapses in AD

Finally, to determine the consequence of Spp1 deficiency on synapse numbers in 6 mo App NL-F animals, we used
super-resolution microscopy to analyze presynaptic and postsynaptic markers
(Bassoon and Homer1, respectively) in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum of
6 mo App NL-F mice (Fig. 4g,h ). While we observed synaptic loss in
colocalized Bassoon and Homer1-immunoreactive synaptic puncta density in App NL-F versus
WT mice, Spp1 deficiency restored this
synapse loss (Fig. 4h ). Likewise, we
observed that acute oAβ challenge failed to induce synapse loss in Spp1 KO/KO mice as it did in WT mice, suggesting
that SPP1 is required for oAβ-induced synapse loss (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Altogether, these results
suggest that SPP1, likely secreted from PVMs in vivo in response to oAβ
vasculature deposition, acts as an extrinsic signal to promote microglial
engulfment of synapses and synapse loss in 6-month App NL-F animals.

To obtain insight into how SPP1 may regulate interactions between
perivascular cells, that is PVM and PVF, and parenchymal microglia in the App NL-F hippocampus, we dissected hippocampi from 6-month WT, Spp1 KO/KO , App NL-F , and App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO animals and sorted
CD45 high CD11 int CD206 + PVMs, CD140a + PVFs and
CD45 int CD11 int CX3CR1 high microglia for scRNA-seq analysis using the 10× Genomics platform. After
quality control, we ran unsupervised clustering and annotated cell types based
on expression of known marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Table 2 ). Microglia expressed exclusive pan-markers
such as Sall1, Tmem119 and P2ry12; PVMs showed enrichment in Mrc1 , Pf4 and Cd163 (Extended Data Fig. 6b ) 11 . Of note, the sorted
CD140a + cells also included
oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs), which were discerned according to expression
of OPC-specific markers including Lhfpl3 , Sox6 and Bcan (Extended Data Fig. 6b ). Further, PVFs were positive for Cdh5 , Lama1 and Dcn that distinguished them from OPC.
Interestingly, we did not observe Spp1 mRNA
expression levels in the sorted PVMs (Extended Data Fig. 2d ). This conforms with previous scRNA-seq
datasets from homogenized and isolated tissues 35 ; however, translatome
analysis of PVMs of brains of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin challenged Cx3cr1 ccre :Lyve1 ncre :RiboTag mice have demonstrated the presence
of Spp1 in
Lyve1 + PVMs (Extended Data Fig. 6c ) 11 , 37 . Indeed, comparative RiboTag analysis of
challenged split-Cre animals that target PVMs and microglia,
respectively 11 , confirmed prominent Spp1 expression in PVMs as compared to microglia (Extended Data
Fig. 6d ). The discrepancy of detected
expression levels between scRNA-seq of isolated cells versus the RiboTag
approach, which bypasses cell isolation and sorting 38 , 39 , and the highly sensitive smFISH methods
suggest that Spp1 signature within PVMs is
highly regulated and closely associated to changes in its microenvironment, as
earlier demonstrated for many other microglial
transcripts 40 . It further suggests that Spp1 + PVMs
likely do not survive isolation and highlights the relevance of studying SPP1 in
an intact spatial context.

Next, we used NicheNet on the scRNA-seq datasets to predict
ligand–target links between interacting cells 28 . Specifically, we
applied NicheNet to investigate how intercellular communication between PVM/PVF
(ligand) and microglia (target) is altered by Spp1 deficiency in 6-month App NL-F mice (Fig. 5 ). We hypothesized SPP1 to function through
paracrine and/or autocrine mechanisms, that is, modulating microglial function
through direct or indirect signaling within the perivascular space. Among top
predicted ligands affected in PVMs and PVFs by Spp1 deficiency in 6-month App NL-F hippocampus is transforming
growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), a cytokine critical for microglial
development and previously shown to be modulated by SPP1 within
fibroblasts 41 , 42 (Fig. 5a–c ). Other ligands include A Disintegrin and
Metallopeptidase Domain 17 (ADAM17) and calreticulin, the latter being reported
as an ‘eat-me’ signal driving macrophage phagocytosis of
apoptotic cells 43 . Further, expression of Itgb5, Itgb1 and Itgav , encoding integrin receptors
and subunits of the SPP1 receptor, were affected in microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO versus App NL-F mice, as
expected 44 . Other top affected receptors in microglia
were Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn6 (Fig. 5b,c ) 45 , 46 . We further validated these results via
smFISH-IHC; as suggested by NicheNet, Tgfbr1 and Itgb5 expression levels were dysregulated
in microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO versus App NL-F mice (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f ). In addition, we confirmed decreased
expression of CD29 ( Itgb1 ) and CD321
( F11r ) in hippocampal microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO compared to App NL-F animals by flow cytometry
(Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6f ). Altogether, NicheNet revealed
evidence for paracrine and autocrine crosstalk signals between the perivascular
space and microglia in App NL-F mice in the context of SPP1
signaling, with the majority of the top hits implicating potential alterations
of microglial phagocytic states. Fig. 5 Spp1 regulates

## Discussion
Microglia–synapse engulfment has been demonstrated to be
relevant to synaptic loss and dysfunction in a wide variety of neurologic diseases
across the lifespan, including neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders,
acute injury and virus-induced cognitive impairment, and multiple sclerosis and
neurodegeneration 15 , 29 , 47 – 56 . Genetic studies in sporadic AD further
highlight the importance of understanding microglial
phagocytosis 14 . Therefore, our study demonstrating a functional
role for SPP1 in microglia–synapse phagocytosis will likely have broad
relevance to understanding neuroimmune mechanisms of synapse vulnerability in AD and
other neurologic diseases involving synaptopathy.

Here we report a role for perivascular SPP1 as an upstream mediator of
microglia–synapse engulfment in both genetic ( App NL-F ) and acute oAβ challenge
mouse models. SPP1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein that was originally identified
as a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by T cells and later found to be expressed in
distinct tissue-resident macrophages linked with active clearance of apoptotic
cells, chemotaxis and macrophage migration 18 , 57 . In the brain, SPP1 expression appears to be
highly regulated in a spatiotemporal and cell type-specific manner, depending on
context, age and brain region. In the perinatal and prenatal brain, Spp1 is expressed by microglia and associates with axon
tracts of the corpus callosum, in contrast to the adult brain where SPP1 expression
is thought to be restricted to glutaminergic and GABAergic neurons in adult
hindbrain 11 , 37 , 58 – 60 . Using various imaging tools including
smFISH-IHC and CLEM in Spp1 TdT mice, we demonstrate that SPP1
expression in the hippocampus of healthy adult WT animals is restricted to the
perivascular space, that is, Pf4 ,
CD163 + and
CD206 + PVM and to a much lesser extent, the
closely neighboring PVFs. The finding that PVMs act as a major source of SPP1 upon
oAβ challenge is consistent with the enrichment of ribosome-attached Spp1 transcripts in
Lyve1 + PVMs compared to
Sall1 + microglia and is consistent with our
earlier study that shows Spp1 upregulation in
Lyve1 + PVMs upon LPS challenge in adult
mice 11 . Further, we found PVMs as the predominant
cellular origin for SPP1 activation in early App models coinciding with Aβ aggregation along the vasculature. Of note, a
recent study demonstrated early Spp1 upregulation
in spinal cord PVFs in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, preceding
microglial activation and onset of motor neuron loss 61 . This suggests that SPP1
activation might represent a conserved molecular response to perturbed perivascular
homeostasis, potentially beyond Aβ pathology.

We further recapitulated the perivascular localization of SPP1 in
postmortem human brains of AD patients. These results are in line with a recent
single-nucleus transcriptomic study in vessel-associated structures of the human
cortex that found SPP1 expression in perivascular
myeloid cells 62 . Our study thus raises an intriguing question of
what could possibly trigger SPP1 elevation within the perivascular space. In AD
patients, SPP1 levels are elevated in CSF 21 – 23 , which flows via the perivascular space toward
the subarachnoid space. The cellular origin or the functional relevance of SPP1
increase, however, has been unclear. PVMs are distributed along the perivascular
space and may have a critical role as sentinels in amyloidosis (our data here and
ref. 63 ).
Clearance of Aβ across the BBB represents an important homeostatic function,
the impairment of which has been linked to exacerbated vascular as well as
parenchymal deposition of Aβ 64 , 65 . Blood vessels therefore may represent a
frequent, early and vulnerable site for Aβ deposition. In support of this,
vascular pathology is commonly observed in AD, afflicting approximately 80% of
patients 66 . Our findings of oAβ deposition along
the vasculature in early stages of amyloidosis in App NL-F mice further support this view.
Indeed, it was postulated that early failure of perivascular drainage could
contribute to parenchymal Aβ deposition and associated neuronal
toxicity 67 . Furthermore, SPP1 has been linked to the
clearance of vascular Aβ deposits in mice 68 . Altogether, these and our
studies highlight Aβ deposition along the vasculature as a possible trigger
for SPP1 upregulation in PVMs and PVFs. Future studies allowing cell-type specific
fate mapping and mutagenesis of SPP1 in hippocampal PVM and PVF subsets will be
needed to provide insight into the origin and fate of SPP1-expressing perivascular
subsets.

Our observation that SPP1 signaling promotes synaptic engulfment by
microglia in the hippocampus of AD models suggests that SPP1 functions to regulate
phagocytic cell states. Indeed, in the absence of Spp1 , microglia fail to upregulate key phagocytic and AD-relevant
genes such as progranulin and Ctsb in 6-month App NL-F mice. Of
note, phagocytosis induced by microglial progranulin as well as complement proteins
including C3 has been considered protective against Aβ plaque load and
neuronal loss in plaque-rich mouse models of AD. In line with our data, this
suggests that the timing of phagocytic activity in different stages of disease might
be critical to determine the protective versus detrimental nature of the
outcome 15 , 69 , 70 . Another interesting question raised is how SPP1
modulates microglial phagocytosis in the presence of Aβ pathology. SPP1
functions as a secreted or intracellular isoform 71 . Based on our data, a
direct effect of intracellular SPP1 on microglia function seems unlikely in our
experimental setting. First, we found that microglia-intrinsic Spp1 signaling is not required for the engulfment of
Aβ-treated synaptosomes, where primary microglia derived from WT and Spp1 KO/KO mice exhibit similar engulfment capacities
of synaptosomes in the presence of extracellular SPP1. This is consistent with work
in primary gut macrophages from Spp1 -deficient
mice, whereby low doses of recombinant SPP1 restored phagocytic function toward
opsonized bacteria, akin to what we observed for primary microglia and
synaptosomes 72 . Second, we did not observe mRNA or protein SPP1
expression localized inside hippocampal microglia at the age of 6 months,
yet the same cells fail to engulf synapses in App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice or Spp1 KO/KO mice challenged with synaptotoxic Aβ.
Third, we found increased protein levels of SPP1-immunoreactive puncta within the
SLM parenchyma using super-resolution imaging, suggesting that the observed punctate
signals are mostly extracellular. Altogether, these results suggest that SPP1 is
secreted by PVMs and PVFs and influences microglia phagocytosis.

Precise mechanisms of how microglial engulfment is initiated by SPP1
are to be investigated. SPP1 could opsonize neuronal material for example damaged
synapses for microglial phagocytosis 73 . It could also engage directly with the
canonical receptors,
α v β 3 , which are
expressed on microglia 37 , to trigger downstream signaling pathways.
Indeed, using NicheNet, we observed Itgb3 and Itgav , which encode
α v β 3 , to be
downregulated in microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice. Our NicheNet analysis further shows
reduced expression levels of both Tgfb1 in PVMs
and its receptor Tgfbr2 in microglia from App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice, suggesting that SPP1 potentially
coordinates perivascular–microglial crosstalk via autocrine TGF-β
signaling. Indeed, SPP1 has been identified to promote autocrine TGF-β
signaling in fibroblasts in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, thereby promoting
fibrosis by neighboring fibroblasts and macrophages 41 . Further, TGF-β is
a major determinant of microglia maturation and homeostasis, and Tgfbr2 deficient microglia demonstrate dysregulated
expression of transcripts related to phagosome formation and immune
activation 42 , 45 . In contrast to decreased Tgfbr2 , we observed increased Tgfbr1 signaling in microglia of App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO versus App NL-F animals. It is tempting to
speculate that this paradoxical down- and upregulation reflects compensatory
mechanisms to counteract microglia phagocytosis induced by SPP1. Finally,
TGF-β1 has been shown to be increased in CSF and perivascular space of AD
patients, where its levels positively correlate with Aβ deposition along
blood vessels, and TGF-β1-overexpressing mice show enhanced microglial
phagocytosis and plaque amelioration in a complement-dependent
manner 74 , 75 . Further studies are needed to gain better
insight into the role of TGF-β signaling in governing autocrine and
paracrine PVM-microglial crosstalk in AD. Other predicted Spp1 -specific pathways in microglia of App NL-F mice include Calr , encoding for calreticulin, a multifunctional
chaperone protein that has been described as an ‘eat-me’
signal 43 . Altogether, our results suggest multiple
mechanisms by which microglial phagocytosis could be modulated by perivascular SPP1
signaling. Determining molecular mechanisms of how these pathways may contribute to
synaptic engulfment will be important to better understand multicellular events and
crosstalk between perivascular space and the brain parenchyma.

Altogether, our study nominates perivascular SPP1 as a modulator for
microglial phagocytosis, impacting microglia–synapse interactions and
synaptic homeostasis. In peripheral tissues, insight into stroma–macrophage
interactions demonstrates intricate and functionally relevant immune crosstalk that
underlies critical tissue remodeling and homeostasis 76 . Likewise, our results
highlight a potential role for perivascular–microglia interactions in the
brain, and the presence of an SPP1-producing perivascular niche may offer
opportunities to specifically manipulate and block microglia-mediated synaptic
engulfment.

## Methods
All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animal
(Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and following local ethical advice.
Experimental procedures were approved by the UK Home Office and ethical approval
was granted through consultation with veterinary staff at University College
London (UCL).

For all experiments, C57BL/6J (WT) mice were obtained from Charles
River UK. Spp1 KO/KO (B6.129S6(Cg)-Spp1 tm1Blh /J; stock 4936) and
CX 3 CR-1 GFP (B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1 tm1Litt /J; stock 5582) mice
were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. App NL-F/NL-F mice were obtained from
F. A. Edwards (Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology,
UCL, UK) 30 . Cx3cr1 ccre :Sall1 ncre (split-Cre) R26-LSL-tdTom: Rpl22 HA (RiboTag) and Cx3cr1 ccre :Lyve1 ncre R26-LSL-tdTom: Rpl22 HA homozygous animals were
maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions and handled according to
protocols approved by the Weizmann Institute Animal Care Committee as per
international guidelines. All animals were housed under temperature-controlled
(temperature, 23.1 °C; humidity, 30–60%) and
pathogen-free conditions with 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with an
ad libitum supply of food and water. Both male and female age-matched mice were
used in this study: WT males and females, Spp1 KO/KO males,
CX 3 CR-1 GFP males, Spp1 tm1(tdTomato)Msasn males, App NL-F/NL-F males and App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO males.

All animal work was approved by the Jackson Laboratory Animal Care
and Use Committee and adhered to the standards of the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals set forth by the NIH. The Spp1 tm1(tdTomato)Msasn mouse allele was generated
using direct delivery of CRISPR–Cas9 reagents to mouse zygotes. An
IRES-tdT construct was introduced in the mouse Spp1 gene (Ensembl Gene UID,
ENSMUSG00000029304; Extended Data Fig. 3a ). Analysis of genomic DNA sequence surrounding the target
region, using the Benchling ( www.benchling.com ) guide RNA (gRNA) design tool, identified a gRNA sequence
(AACAAGAAAAAGTGTTAGTG) with a suitable target endonuclease site at the stop
codon of exon 7 of the mouse Spp1 locus. Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) V3
protein and gRNA were purchased as part of the Alt-R CRISPR–Cas9 system
using the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex format as the gRNA species (IDT). Alt-R
CRISPR–Cas9 crRNAs (1072532, IDT) were synthesized using the gRNA
sequences specified in the DESIGN section and hybridized with the Alt-R tracrRNA
(1072534, IDT) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. A plasmid
construct with a 2 kB 5′ homology arm ending 62 bp past
the Spp1 stop codon in exon 7, IRES, tdT coding sequence, bGH poly(A) signal and
1.5 kB 3′ homology arm was synthesized by Genscript (Extended
Data Fig. 3b ). To prepare the gene
editing reagent for electroporation, SpCas9:gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes
were formed by incubating Alt-R–SpCas9 V3 (1081059, IDT) and gRNA
duplexes for 20 min at room temperature in embryo tested
Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 7.5). Fertilized mouse embryos were generated
via natural mating and cultured as described previously 77 . C57BL/6J (Stock
000664, The Jackson Laboratory) donor female mice (3–4 weeks of age)
were superovulated by administration of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum
gonadotrophin via intraperitoneal (ip) injection (HOR-272, ProSpec) followed
47 h later by 5 IU (ip) human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (HOR-250,
ProSpec). Immediately postadministration of hCG, the female was mated 1:1 with a
C57BL/6J stud male and 22 h later checked for the presence of a
copulation plug. Female mice displaying a copulation plug were sacrificed, the
oviducts excised and embryos collected. Electroporation was performed as
described in ref. 77 . In brief, zygotes were treated with the
acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788, Millapore-Sigma) for 10 s and
washed extensively in prewarmed M2 media (M7167, Millapore-Sigma). Zygotes were
then placed in 10 μl drops of Opti-MEM media (3198570, Thermo
Fisher Scientific–Gibco). Ten microliters of gene editing reagent
solution, including the SpCas9/gRNA and the ssDO, was mixed with the Opti-MEM
drops with the embryos and deposited into a 1 mm electroporation cuvette
(45-0124, Harvard Apparatus). Electroporation was performed in an ECM830 Square
Wave Electroporation System (45-0661, BTX). The electroporation setting was a
1 ms pulse duration and two pulses with 100 ms pulse interval at
30 V. Following the electroporation, a prewarmed 100 μl
aliquot of M2 media was deposited into the cuvette with a sterile plastic
pipette to recover the embryos. The zygotes were removed from the cuvette and
washed in prewarmed M2 media. Embryos were immediately transferred into B6Qsi5F1
pseudopregnant female mice, an F1 hybrid strain produced by breeding C57BL/6J
female mice with the inbred Quackenbush Swiss line 5 mouse
strain 78 .

Founders were first assayed by short-range PCR with primer SR-FF
5′-TAATAATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGA-3′ and reverse primer SR-RR
5′-CTTTGATGACGGCCATGTTGTT-3′ within the reporter construct (see
schematic). Positive founders were then screened by PCR: across the 5′
homology arm with primer 5′LR_F
5′-GAAAGTGCCTACTCGTGCCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′LR_R:
CACATTGCCAAAAGACGGCA-3′; across the 3′ homology arm with primers
8431 GCATCGCATTGTCTGAGTAGGT and 3′LR_R: ccatcatggctttgcatgac; and for
the presence of plasmid backbone with primers 8431: GCATCGCATTGTCTGAGTAGGT and
9581: AGCGCAACGCAATTAATGTG. Sanger sequencing was performed across the homology
arm junctions and portions of the knocked-in reporter gene (Extended Data Fig. 3c ).

Founders were selected that were positive by short-range PCR
assays, had appropriate sequence across the homology arm junctions, were
negative for the plasmid backbone and had correct sequence of the inserted
construct. These were bred to C57BL/6J.

Once the line was established, mice were genotyped using a Taqman
qPCR protocol run on a real-time PCR instrument (Roche LightCycler480). Forward
primers for the wild-type allele (AAACACAGTTCCTTACTTTGCAT producing a
94 bp product) and the mutant allele (AGGATTGGGAAGACAATAGCA in the bGH
poly A producing an 84 bp product) were combined with a common reverse
primer (CACTGAACTGAGAAATGAGCAGT) using an annealing temperature of
60 °C. The wild-type probe (5′ HEX fluorophore label)
used was TGTTAGTGAGGGTTAAGCAGGAATA and the knock-in probe (5′ FAM
fluorophore label) used was ATGCGGTGGGCTCTATGG, each utilizing a black hole
quencher on their 3′ end. These were run with an EndPoint protocol,
imaging negative (quenched) fluorescent values at the completion of the cycling
protocol.

This new line of Spp1 -IRES-TdT
mice is available as B6J. Spp1 tm1(tdTomato)Msasn /J (stock 33731) from The
Jackson Laboratory.

S26C Aβ(1–40) 2 dimers were
purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals 15 . Adult
(2–3 months) mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane followed
by maintenance at 1.5–2% isoflurane during surgery. Surgery was
performed after head fixing in a stereotaxic frame (World Precision
Instruments). Marcaine (0.025%) was applied locally, the skull was exposed by a
single incision along the midline and a unilateral craniotomy was drilled with a
0.9-bit drill burr (Hager and Meisinger). Pulled long-shaft borosilicate
pipettes (Drummond Scientific) were backfilled with mineral oil before loading
with oAβ
(1 ng µl −1 ) or
sterile PBS vehicle. Four microliters total volume was injected into the right
lateral ventricle (stereotaxic coordinates in millimeters from Paxinos and
Franklin’s The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, Fourth Edition;
AP: −0.40, ML: 1.00, DV: −2.50) using a Nanofil 10 ml
syringe (World Precision Instruments) connected to an UltraMicroPump-3 (World
Precision Instruments) at a flow rate of
400 nl min −1 . The pipette
was left in place for 5 min after complete substance injection and
slowly withdrawn to avoid backflow along the pipette track. The incision on the
scalp was closed with Vetbond tissue adhesive (3 M). Subcutaneous
carprofen (Carprieve,
5 mg g −1 body weight) and
buprenorphine (Vetergesic,
0.1 mg g −1 body weight)
diluted in 0.9% saline were administered perioperatively. Animals received
carprofen (33.33 mg ml −1 ) in
their drinking water until tissue collecting. The left hemisphere, contralateral
to the injection site, was analyzed.

Deeply anesthetized mice were transcardially perfused with
25–30 ml of filtered PBS, followed by 20 ml of 4%
ice-cold ultrapure PFA (Generon, 18814-20). Brains were removed from the skull
and fixed in 4% PFA (Generon) for 24 h at 4 °C. For
cryoprotection, brains were rinsed in PBS for at least 2 h to remove
excess PFA and placed in 30% sucrose for 48 h before embedding in
optimal cutting compound. Fresh cryosections were blocked with 5% BSA, 0.2%
Triton X-100 and 5% Donkey serum in PBS at room temperature for 90 min
before incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. All
primary antibodies were diluted in a blocking buffer. After 4X PBS washes for
15 min each, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies in
blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature and then washed again with
PBS. All secondary antibody aliquots were centrifugated at 15,000 g for 15 min before being diluted in
blocking buffer. The sections were then incubated for 5 min in DAPI
diluted in PBS before being mounted either in Prolong Gold Antifade Mounting
Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930 ) for confocal imaging or in Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant ( P36982 ) for STED imaging.

For immunostaining of C1q and synapses, 30 µm
free-floating tissue sections were washed in PBS, followed by pretreatment in 1%
Triton X-100 for 20. Sections were then blocked in 20% NGS, 1% BSA and 0.3%
Triton, in PBS for 2 h followed by standard primary antibody incubation
overnight at 4 °C. Sections are washed in 0.3% Triton X-100 in
PBS for 30 min followed by secondary incubation for 4 h at room
temperature and wash for 30 min before mounting.

Brains were donated to the Queen Square Brain Bank (QSBB) for
neurological disorders (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology). All tissue
samples were donated with full, informed consent. Accompanying clinical and
demographic data of all cases used in this study were stored electronically in
compliance with the 1998 data protection act and are summarized in Supplementary
Table 1 . Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the NHS research ethics committee and in accordance with
the human tissue authority’s code of practice and standards under
license number 12,198, with an approved material transfer agreement. The cohort
included pathologically diagnosed cases of AD ( n = 6) and neurologically normal controls
( n = 6). The level of AD
pathology in all cases was assessed using current diagnostic consensus
criteria 79 , 80 . The APOE genotype was also determined for each case as previously
described 81 . Information regarding sex is included in
Supplementary Table 1 ; however, sex
was not taken into consideration when including patient samples. Findings did
not apply to only one sex .

Slides with 8 µm mounted tissue sections from the
frontal cortex were incubated at 60 °C overnight. Sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing grades of alcohol. Slides
were incubated in methanol/hydrogen peroxide (0.3%) solution for 10 min
to block endogenous peroxidase activity. For heat-induced antigen retrieval,
slides were then transferred to a boiling solution of 0.1 M citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) and pressure cooked at maximum pressure for 10 min.
Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating slides in 10% nonfat milk for
30 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated in anti-SPP1
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three gentle 5 min
washes in tris-buffered saline with tween (TBS-T); slides were incubated for
45 min in biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories, BA-9200, 1:200). Slides were washed and incubated in
avidin–biotin complex (ABC; Vector Laboratories) for signal
amplification. The slides were then washed for a final time and
3,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen and counterstained in
Mayer’s hematoxylin (BDH). Finally, slides were dehydrated in increasing
grades of alcohol (70%, 90% and 100% industrial methylated spirits), cleared in
xylene and mounted.

Double immunofluorescence staining was carried out on the frontal
cortex. Sections were prepared as detailed above up to the incubation of the
anti-SPP1 antibody, secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse and ABC. Antibody
binding was visualized using a TSA Cyanine 3 amplification kit (PerkinElmer),
which was applied to sections for 20 min at room temperature. After
TBS-T washing, sections were incubated with anti-CD206 antibody for 1 h
at room temperature and species-appropriate Alexa Fluor 658 secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen, 1:1,000) for 2 h at room temperature to visualize the
antibody. Sections were washed a final three times in TBS-T and mounted using
Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).

Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope
(×40 objective, 1.3NA oil, ×20 objective 0.8-NA and
63×0.8-NA oil). Settings were kept constant for all sections in the same
comparison group. Step size was determined using the optimal interval adjustment
on the Zen blue software with a stack size of 10–14 µm
for all on-slide IHC experiments and 6–10 µm for
RNAScope experiments.

For quantification of secreted SPP1, Triton X-100 was excluded from
the blocking buffer to retain signals of secreted and membrane-bound protein
immune reactivity. To quantify SPP1 protein expression, images were processed in
Fiji ImageJ (NIH) 82 . An automated ImageJ macro was created to
analyze the signal intensity of each slice in the z stack and select the plane with the highest signal intensity.
Background was subtracted with a rolling ball radius of 10 pixels. Images were
thresholded with consistent thresholding parameters and made into binary images
based on intensity. As pixel intensity information has been translated into
area, the particle analysis function was used to quantify the total
immune-reactive area.

For immunostaining, all the antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse

(1/400, Jackson ImmunoResearch and Thermo Fisher Scientific) chosen from goat
anti-rabbit, goat anti-rat, goat anti-mouse, donkey anti-goat, donkey anti-rat,
donkey anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit secondaries. For flow cytometry, BUV395
CD45 (BD Biosciences, 564279; 1/400), Pe-Cy7 CD11b (BD Biosciences, 552850;
1/400), BV421 CX3CR1 (Biolegend, 149023; 1/400), PE CD140a (Miltenyi,

102205; 1/200) and BV711 CD321 (BD Biosciences, 745405; 1/200) were used.

Engulfment analysis was performed as previously
described 15 . Thirty micrometers of free-floating tissue
sections were immunostained with IBA1, CD68 and Homer1. For each mouse, four to
six regions of interest within CA1 SLM were acquired using a
63 × 1.4-NA objective on a Zeiss 800 microscope. Next,
60–80 z -stack planes were taken with
0.27-μm spacing and raw images were processed in Imaris (Bitplane) for
analysis, after background subtraction of Homer1 channel.
P2Y12 + cells and CD68 lysosomes were
surface rendered with 0.25-μm and 0.1-μm smoothing,
respectively. A mask was applied within
P2Y12 + CD68 + reconstructed lysosomes for Homer1,
and the percentage engulfment of Homer1 within lysosomes was calculated using
the following formula: volume of engulfed material (Homer1 within CD68)/total
microglial volume × 100.

Super-resolution synapse images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880
microscope with Airyscan detector using a 63x, 1.4-NA oil immersion
Plan-Apochromat objective (theoretical maximum resolution—140 nm
lateral, 350 nm axial). A zoom factor of 1.8× and a
37 × 37 × 144 nm voxel
pixel size. The Airyscan detector was aligned before imaging each new slide.
Three regions of interest of 1.15 µm were acquired in the center
of the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum for each brain section. Super-resolution
synapse images were processed in Zen Black using 3D Airyscan Processing. Imaris
software was used for presynaptic and postsynaptic puncta detection, using
intensity centers to maximize the detection of immunoreactive spots. Presynaptic
and postsynaptic spots were colocalized using a MATLAB colocalization script
(Colocalize Spots XTension), using a colocalization distance of
0.25 μm between spot centers. Synapse density is shown as App NL-F mice
normalized to WT mice, and App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO normalized to Spp1 KO/KO mice.

To detect single RNA molecules, the RNA probes for Spp1 (435191), C1q (441221), Bin1 (529541), Ctsb (561541), Grn (422861), Cd163 (406631), Pdgfra (480661), Pf4 (502391), Tmem119 (472901), Tgfbr1 (406201) and Itgb5 (404311) were purchased from advanced cell
diagnostics. RNAscope was performed following the manufacturer’s
protocol in RNAscopeFluorescent Multiplex Assay (320293). 15 μm
frozen brain sections were collected on Superfrost Plus GOLD Slides (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, K5800AMNZ72) and dried overnight at 40 °C.
Briefly, slides were incubated in
H 2 O 2 for 4 min at room
temperature and washed in RNAse-free water. Slides were placed in boiling target
antigen retrieval for 4 min, dehydrated in 100% ethanol for
5 min and treated with Protease Plus for 15 min at room
temperature before probe incubation. Further protocol as described by the
manufacturer, and post-RNAscope immunostaining as standard immunohistochemistry
procedure.

Mice were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold PBS. Next, fresh
cortex and hippocampus were dissected and homogenized with TissueLyser II
(QIAGEN) using the mRNA easy mini kit (QIAGEN) as described by the manufacturer.
Next, RNA purity and concentration were assessed by Nanodrop. mRNA was converted
to cDNA using the qScript cDNA SuperMix reverse transcription kit as described
by the manufacturer (95048, Quantabio). For RT-qPCR, 12 ng of cDNA was
loaded in triplicates per gene in a total volume of 20 μl using
the SYBR green PCR master mix as described by the manufacturer (4309155, Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The reaction was run using a LightCycler 96 Instrument
(Roche) with white 96-well plates (04729692001, Roche). Triplicate Ct values
were averaged and data are shown as respective to the geomean of three
housekeeping genes ( Actb, Gapdh and Rpl32 ) using the Ct delta method
(2–∆∆Ct). Primers purchased from IDT were used at a
concentration of 200 nM. Actb ,

PBS-perfused brains were quickly isolated from the skull and the
hippocampus was dissected on ice using chilled instruments. For scRNA
sequencing, brains were perfused with inhibitor cocktail including Actinomycin D
(5 μg ml −1 ) and
triptolide (10 μM). Next, single-cell suspension was prepared
using the Adult Brain Dissociation kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany), according manufacturer’s instructions and ref. 25 . Afterwards, cell suspension was filtered
through a 70 μM cell strainer before mixing with debris removal
solution. Cells were centrifuged (300 g for
10 min), washed with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 0.78 mM
EDTA) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with FACS buffer
containing Fc block (BD Biosciences) and primary antibody mix. Flow cytometry
data were analyzed using FACSDiva software 4.0 and FlowJo 10 software
(Treestar).

For generation of microglial primary cultures, P0 WT or Spp1 KO/KO mice were decapitated, the brain was
dissected from the skull and meninges were removed in ice-cold HBSS with 5% FBS.
Eight to ten mice were pooled per culture preparation. Tissue was homogenized
first with 2 ml pipettes (15 strokes) in 15 ml falcon tube and
subsequently transferred to a prewet 50 ml tube with
70 μM strainer. The 15 ml tube was washed with HBSS and
then put through filter to ensure all tissues were collected. The supernatant
was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 35% isotonic
percoll. The interface was carefully created with HBSS. The samples were
centrifuged for 40 min at 4 °C at 2,800 g with no break and with slow acceleration and
deceleration. The myelin layer and supernatant layers were aspirated, and the
cell pellet was washed in HBSS. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in
1 ml microglial media (DMEM F12 (Gibco), 5% FBS (Gibco), 1% pen-strep
(Gibco), 50 ng ml −1 CSF1
416-ML-010/CF (RnD Systems),
50 ng ml −1 TGFb1
7666-MB-005/CF (RnD Systems) and
100 ng ml −1 CX3CL1
472-FF-025/CF (RnD Systems)) for cell counting. Cells were used within
7–10 d of plating.

Three to five 8-week-old animals were pooled per experiment. In
brief, mice were intracardiac perfused with 10 ml ice-cold PBS. The
hippocampi and cortices were dissected on ice. Tissue was weighed and
homogenized in five volumes of sucrose homogenization buffer (5 mM HEPES
pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA) using a Dounce homogenizer
with 15–20 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and
the supernatant was saved as total homogenate fraction (THF). The THF was
centrifuged again at 14,000 g for
12 min at 4 °C and supernatant was saved as cytosolic
fraction. The pellet was carefully resuspended in 550 μl of
Krebs–Ringer buffer (KRB: 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose and 1 mM EDTA) and
450 µl of Percoll solution (for a final concentration of 45%).
The solution was mixed by gently inverting the tube and an interface was slowly
created with 400 µl of KRB. After centrifugation at
14,000 g for 2 min at
4 °C, the synaptosomal fraction was recovered at the surface of
the flotation gradient and carefully resuspended in 1 ml of KRB to wash.
The functional synaptosomal preparation was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 1 min at 4 °C. Fresh
mouse synaptosomes were immediately divided into Eppendorfs at
2–2.5 mg of protein and resuspended in total 1 ml KRB in
50 nM of oAβ 40-S26C dimer or PBS as control and left overnight
at 4 °C on nutator. Synaptosomes were then centrifuged at
14,000 g for 1 min at
4 °C, supernatant was discarded and synaptosomes were washed in
1 ml PBS, after which they were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 1 min at 4 °C to
obtain oAβ-synaptosomes and control-synaptosomes. Briefly, 1 mg
of synaptosomes were left at room temperature on nutator for 2 h in
sodium bicarbonate 0.1 M with pHrodo Red, succinimidyl ester at a
concentration of 1 mg ml −1 .
After conjugation, synaptosomes were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 1 min and resuspended for use in the
in vitro synaptosome engulfment assay.

Primary mouse microglia were treated with 1 µg of
pHrodo-conjugated S26C oAβ-treated synaptosomes. Plates were then placed
in a CD7 with the incubator at 37 °C and 5%
CO 2 . Fluorescent (594 nm and 647 nm)
and brightfield (oblique and phase) images were acquired at a ×20
objective (×0.5) at intervals of 3–5 min. A three-slice z stack was taken at a 1.5-μm
interval to ensure that imaging was within focus throughout the imaging session;
however, one plane was used for analysis. For analysis, the z -profile axis was plotted for respective pHrodos
on ImageJ with respect to time. Fluorescence intensity at t = 0 was subtracted from
subsequent time frames.

For visualization of secreted SPP1 in mouse and human tissue,
tissue sections were imaged with Leica STELLARIS 8 STED microscope using the
×100 objective (1.4 NA oil) (Leica Microsystems). Tissue sections were
imaged at least 24 h after being coverslipped with mounting medium to
avoid discrepancies in fluorescence lifetime within each section. STED
microscope with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (STED-FLIM) was used to visualize
secreted SPP1 in the extracellular space and fluorescence lifetime information
was used to gate fluorescence signals. Alignment between STED laser and
excitation laser was performed before each imaging session. A 775 nm
STED laser was used to generate a doughnut beam to silence the peripheral
fluorophores from Alexa Flour 647 photoexcitation to achieve subdiffractional
resolution. For all STED images, pixel size was limited to at most
50 nm. STED laser intensity was set at 20%. All images were taken with a
step size of 0.15 μm. Fluorescence signal was time-gated from
−0.5 ms to 4.5 ms. For analysis, raw images were
processed by thresholding, followed by binary image transformation to match ROI
with intensity. Finally, fluorescence intensity was measured by the particle
analysis function in ImageJ (NIH).

Mice were perfusion fixed with 4% PFA (EM grade) in ice-cold PBS as
described above, the brain was dissected and left in 4% PFA in PBS overnight at
4 °C. The following day, coronal vibratome slices
(100 μm) of the brain were collected and slices containing clear
cross sections of the hippocampus were manually trimmed to minimally contain the
hippocampus and ensure that the tissue piece was asymmetric. Low-resolution maps
of the entire hippocampus tissue piece were taken using a confocal Zeiss LSM800
and ×10 lens with montaging for gross mapping and identification of
regions of interest. High-resolution
(63 × 1.4 NA) confocal stacks were taken of
regions of interest. Slices were fixed further with 2% formaldehyde/1.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, before being processed for
volume EM using a modified protocol based on the NCMIR
protocol 83 . Briefly, tissue slices were incubated in 1%
osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferricyanide for 1 h at
4 °C, before being washed and left in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate in a fridge overnight. The following day, tissue was incubated in 1%
thiocarbohydrazide for 15 min at 60 °C, 2% osmium
tetroxide for 30 min, 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min and
Walton’s lead aspartate for 30 min at 60 °C,
with numerous distilled water washes between each step. The samples were
consequently dehydrated through an ethanol series, embedded in Epon resin and
baked overnight at 60 °C. Using the maps acquired by light
microscopy, the block was trimmed down to the approximate region of interest and
serial sections were collected on ITO-coated coverslips using an ultramicrotome
(Leica) and diamond knife (Diatome). Coverslips were mounted on SEM stubs using
carbon stickies and silver DAG and array tomography serial back scattered
electron images (5 nm pixels) were acquired for each CLEM cell
( n = 4) using Atlas 5
software and a Gemini 300 SEM (Zeiss) operating in high vacuum, at
4.5 kV with tandem decel operating at 3 kV. Serial images were
registered using TrakEM2 (ref. 84 ) in Fiji (NIH), aligned with the
confocal images in Photoshop (Adobe) using nuclei as unbiased fiducials and 2/3D
reconstructed using Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

For scRNA-seq, we pooled tissue from four mice for each genotype,
to be able to sort rare cell populations. Indeed, from one such preparation, we
could isolate 5,000 microglia but only limited PVMs (200) and PVFs (350) on
average per genotype. For each cell type and each genotype, we prepared a single
scRNA-seq library, and we validated the findings using orthogonal methods such
as smFISH and flow cytometry.

Single-cell libraries were prepared using 10X Genomics Chromium
Next GEM Single Cell 3′ kit v3.1, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were loaded on the chromium chip
according to Supplementary Table 2 ;
because sorted PVMs and fibroblasts were in low abundance, we loaded the whole
sample, while for microglia cells we aimed for 5,000 cells per sample. Libraries
were sequenced using an SP flowcell on an Illumina NovaSeq S6000 instrument,
with sequencing parameters recommended by 10X Genomics, aiming for 40,000 reads
per cell. Raw FASTQ files were preprocessed using 10X Genomics CellRanger
(version 6.0) and the mm10 mouse reference genome. Filtered gene expression
matrices obtained from CellRanger were imported in R (version 4.1.2) and
analyzed using the Seurat (version 4.0.6) and NicheNet (version 1.0.0)
packages 28 . Cells with more than 10% of reads aligning
to mitochondrial transcripts were deemed to be low quality or damaged and
removed from the dataset. Cells remaining after each filtering step are reported
in Supplementary Table 2 .
Identification of high variable genes, PCA and clustering were performed using
Seurat functions. Cluster annotation was performed considering the expression of
a set of known cell type markers (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Differential expression analysis between pairs of
conditions was performed with Seurat’s FindMarkers function using the
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Comparisons between selected cell populations were
performed using NicheNet functions and standard workflow.

Brains were extracted from mice and homogenized in ice-cold
homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl,
12 mM MgCl 2 , 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1:100
protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 units per ml RNasin (Promega) and
0.1 mg ml −1 cycloheximide
(Sigma-Aldrich) in RNase-free DDW) 10% wt/vol with a Dounce homogenizer
(Sigma-Aldrich) until the suspension was homogeneous. Cell debris was removed by
transferring 1 ml of homogenate and centrifuging at 10,000 g and 4 °C for 10 min.
Next, 10 μl of supernatant was removed for
‘input’ analysis and 10 μg of anti-HA.7 antibody
(H9658, Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 µg of mouse monoclonal IgG1
antibody (Merck, PP100) was added to the supernatant, followed by 4 h of
incubation with slow rotation in a cold room at 4 °C. Afterward,
Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were equilibrated to
homogenization buffer by washing three times. Samples were then incubated for
4 h with antibody and afterward beads were added for overnight
incubation at 4 °C. Afterward, samples were washed three times
with high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl,
12 mM MgCl 2 , 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1:200
protease inhibitor, 100 units per ml RNasin and
0.1 mg ml −1 cycloheximide
in RNase-free DDW) for 5 min. At the end of the washes, beads were
magnetized and excess buffer was removed, 100 µl Lysis Buffer
was added to the beads and RNA was extracted with Dynabeads mRNA Direct
purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was eluted in
6 μl H 2 O and taken for RNA
sequencing.

mRNA was captured with Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Qubit fluorometer (Life
Technologies) technology was used to calculate library concentration and mean
molecule size was determined with a 2200 TapeStation instrument. Next, libraries
were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq-500. Raw reads were mapped to the genome
(NCBI37/mm10) using hisat (version 0.1.6). Only reads with unique mapping were
considered for further analysis. Gene expression levels of genes of interest
( Lyve1, Cx3cr1, Sall1 and Spp1 ) were calculated using the User-friendly
Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline 85 . Next, DESeq2 R-package was used for
normalization and differential expression analysis and pValue was adjusted by
multiple gene testing <0.05.

All statistical analysis was performed in Prism (GraphPad Software,
Version 9.3.1). Two groups were compared using two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t -test. For oAβ
injections experiments, two-tailed paired Student’s t -test was used to normalize variances of
injections on different days or in different oAβ batches. To compare
more than two groups (WT, Spp1 KO/KO , App NL-F/NL-F , App NL-F · Spp1 KO/KO mice or PVMs, microglia and PVFs),
one-way ANOVA with Kruskal–Wallis post hoc test was used. To compare
multiple variables (WT and Spp1 KO/KO injected with S26C oAβ), two-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was used. Data in graphs are presented
as mean ± s.e.m. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was
not formally tested. Statistical methods were not used to predetermine study
sizes but were based on similar experiments previously published. Experiments
were blinded to the genotype of the animal as well as the treatment of the
animal. Experiments involving human sections were blinded to the demographics of
the patients. Analysis of flow cytometry data of Spp1 TdT mice was performed in an
unblinded fashion, for compensation purposes. No data were excluded for
analysis.
