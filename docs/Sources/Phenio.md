# Phenio

An ontology for accessing and comparing knowledge concerning phenotypes across species and genetic backgrounds.

Phenio provides the "semantic backbone" of the Monarch Knowledge Graph.  
Designed as an application ontology, it comprises a variety of ontological concepts, in particular all the ones 
that are "core entities" in the Monarch Knowledge Graph (KG), such as diseases, phenotypes and anatomical entities.

Note that while forming an integral part of the Monarch KG, it does not have a "Koza Ingest" configuration like all the other sources, 
but is instead ingested into Monarch KG straight via a `OWL -> obographs -> KGX` transform.
